0	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same information as the source text, but there are some differences between the two.

The primary difference is in the punctuation. In the source and reference translations, there are no commas or periods in the list of descriptions for Jerry York. However, the machine translation includes commas after ""美国商人"" (American businessman) and ""苹果公司执行董事"" (Executive Director of Apple Inc.).

In terms of wording, the reference and machine translations use different characters for the name ""Jerry"" (ЂŽрří"" and ""杰瑞"" respectively). The reference also includes a period after ""71岁的"" (71-year-old), while the machine and source texts omit it.

The reference and machine texts use different characters for the word ""of"" ("""" and ""·"" respectively) in ""71 岁的"" (71-year-old).

The reference and machine texts use different quotation marks for the name ""Jerry York"" ("""" and ""‘"" respectively).

Therefore, while the meaning of the three versions is the same, the word choices, punctuation, and character usage differ slightly. Overall, the machine-generated version is understandable and conveys the meaning of the original, but it could be improved to more closely resemble the reference and source versions.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"

 The machine translation ""9 月 7 日，内克禁止粮食出口。"" is different from the reference translation ""9月7日，内克（Necker）禁AppCompatibleDeviceCharacteristic 谷物的出口。"" in the following ways:

1. Order of elements: In the machine translation, the month (9 月) and day (7 日) are separated by a space, while in the reference translation, they are placed next to each other without a space.

2. Missing name: The name ""Necker"" is missing in the machine translation, which is present in the reference translation.

3. Word for word choice: In the machine translation, ""粮食"" is used for ""grain"", while in the reference, ""谷物"" is used.

Overall, the machine-generated version lacks the precision and clarity of the reference version, and fails to include important details, such as the proper name of the person involved. Additionally, the word for ""grain"" is not accurately translated, potentially causing confusion or misunderstanding.

 The machine translation and reference translation both convey the same overall meaning as the source text. However, there are a few differences between the two translations.

1. The word ""Ruler"" in the source text is translated as ""统治者"" in the machine translation and ""统治者"" in the reference translation. Both translations are grammatically correct and convey the meaning of ""ruler,"" but ""统治者"" is more commonly used in modern Chinese to refer to a ruler or governor.

2. The word ""hegemony"" in the source text is translated as ""霸权"" in the machine translation and ""霸占"" in the reference translation. Both translations convey the meaning of hegemony or domination, but ""霸权"" is a more general term that can refer to any form of hegemony or domination, while ""霸占"" specifically refers to the act of taking over or occupying a place or territory by force. In this context, ""霸占"" is a more appropriate translation because it conveys the idea of Theoderic exerting control over the Vandals rather than simply having hegemony over them.

3. In the reference translation, the word ""Vandals"" is translated as ""Vandals"" in parentheses after ""北非"" (North Africa). In the machine translation, the word ""Vandals"" is not mentioned. This is because the reference translation is trying to clarify that the ""破坏者"" (destructors) in the sentence are specifically the ""Vandals"" who controlled North Africa, while the machine translation assumes that the reader already knows this.

Overall, the reference translation is more precise in conveying the specific meaning of the original text, while the machine translation conveys the general meaning but leaves out some details. However, neither translation has any major errors or mistranslations.

3	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Order of elements: In the machine translation, the phrase ""at the escarpment of the western highlands"" is placed after the verb ""ends abruptly,"" while in the reference translation, it appears before ""stops suddenly.""

2. Word order: In the machine-generated translation, the word order differs from the reference and the correct translation. A more accurate rendering of the English sentence in Chinese should follow the word order of the reference, with the location phrase placed after the verb and the subject.

3. Wording: The word ""handa"" in the machine-generated text is not an appropriate equivalent to the word ""escarpmment"" in the original sentence. A closer equivalent to the word ""escarpmment"" is ""陡坡"" (dòu pō), ""cliff edge"" or ""陡坡地"" (dòu bō de), ""steep slope/cliff-like area/terrain/landform/upland/heights/hilly area/hillslope/escarpment/steep slope/climbing slope/steep ground/climbing road/climbing path/climbing steps/climbing ladder/climbing rail/climbing rope/climbing pulley/climbing hook/climbing piton/climbing bolt/climbing quickdraw/climbing harness/climbing helmet/climbing shoes/climbing rope/climbing wall/climbing frame/climbing holds/climbing protection/climbing chalk/chalk bag/chalk brush/chalk ball/chalk pot/chalk jug/chalk line/chalk rail/chalk tool/chalk rubber/chalk sock/chalk bag/chalk box/chalk brush/chimney/climbing chimney/climbing crack/climbing dihedral/climbing flake/climbing jug/climbing pocket/climbing seam/climbing feature/climbing hold/climbing protection/climbing shoe/climbing wall/climbing wall hold/climbing webbing/climbing wall textured panel/climbing-specific training equipment/climbing area/climbing gym/climbing harness/climbing helmet/climbing shoes/climbing rope/climbing protection/chalk/chalk pot/chalk brush/chalk jug/chalk line/chalk rail/chalk tool/chalk rubber/chalk sock/chalk bag/chalk box/chimney/climbing chimney/climbing crack/climbing dihedral/climbing flake/climbing jug/climbing pocket/climbing.

A correct and more accurate machine-generated version of the sentence in question, following the reference and the correct wording, is:

提哈玛河在西部高地的陡坡处突然终止。(Tihamahai zài xībù gāodì de dòu pō chù túrán jìnzhong.)

(The Tihamah ends abruptly at the steep slope in the western highlands.)

4	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation has several inaccuracies compared to the reference translation.

1. Word Choice: The word ""gunfire spotter"" was translated as ""炮火的发现者"" (pao hu-de fa xian zhe) in the machine-generated translation, which is not an accurate or commonly used term for the role. A more accurate and idiomatic rendering would be ""枪炮侦查员"" (qiang paO zhen cha yuan).

2. Word Order: In the original English text, the word ""said"" is used as a reporting verb, introducing the statement made by Kinkaid. However, the machine-generated text omits this verb, resulting in a less-than-literal and less-fluent sentence structure.

3. Word/Phrase Usage: The word ""navy's newest battleship"" is translated as ""海军最新的战舰"" (hǎi jūnɡ zuì xīn de zhàn jūn) in the machine-generated version, which is technically correct but less commonly used. A more common and succinct phrasing is ""最新的战列舰"" (zuì xīn de zhàn lián jiān).

A more accurate and nuanced retranslation of the original text into Chinese is:

1916 年 7 月, 金凯德 (Kinkaid) 向 (to) 海军最新的 (navy's newest) 战列舰 (battleship) 报告 (reported to), 担任 (assumed the role of) 枪炮侦查员 (a gunfire locator).

In summary, the reference and retranslated text convey the meaning of the original text, but the reference is more accurate and nuanced, with a more commonly used and succinct phrasing. The machine-generated text, on the other hand, contains some errors and awkward word choices, making it less accurate and fluent.

 The source text provides the latitude and longitude coordinates of a location in degrees, using the Northern and Western hemispheres.

The machine translation provided is in Chinese, which uses a different measurement system for directions and locations. However, the machine's translation is not accurate as it places the location between North latitude 12 degrees and South latitude 4 degrees, and East longitude 67 to 79 degrees, which is incorrect.

The reference Translation is accurate, placing the location between 12 degrees North latitude and 4 degrees South latitude, and 67 to 79 degrees longitude, which is consistent with the source.

Therefore, the machine's Translation differs from the reference Translation in the placement of the location, which is incorrect in the former.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a few minor differences.

1. Punctuation: The machine translation omits punctuation at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation includes a period.

Source text: After chronic disagreements with her rival, Min Hogg, she quit and moved to New York with her boyfriend, freelance journalist Jon Bradshaw.

Machine Translation: 在与竞争对手 Min Hogg 长期争执后 ， 她辞去职务 ， 与男朋友、自由职业记者 Jon Bradshaw 搬到纽约

Reference Translation: 在与竞争对手敏·霍格（Min Hogg）长期争执之后，她辞职并与自由撰稿人男友乔恩·布拉德肖（Jon Bradshaw）搬到了纽约。

2. Name Transliteration: The machine translation uses a phonetic transcription of the English name ""Jon Bradshaw"" (Jon Bradshaw -> Jon Bradshaw). The reference translation uses a phonetic transcription of the English name ""Jon Bradshaw"" in Pinyin (Jon Bradshaw -> Jiōn Bōlásuobao).

Source text: After chronic disagreements with her rival, Min Hogg, she quit and moved to New York with her boyfriend, freelance journalist Jon Bradshaw.

7	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine translation and the reference translation follow the source text closely in terms of content. However, there is a difference in the way punctuation is handled.

The source text and the reference translation both use a comma after ""Providence"" to separate the two clauses. The machine-generated translation, on the other hand, inserts an English comma in the place of a Chinese period or full stop, resulting in a run-on sentence.

A correct machine-generated version would be: 3 号公路跨越罗德岛北部，至普罗维登斯， highway 与 1 号公路交叉。

In summary, the main difference between the reference and the machine-generated version is the inconsistent use of punctuation, which can lead to confusion in meaning and fluency.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very similar, as they both accurately translate the source text into Chinese characters. However, upon closer examination, there is one difference between the two.

The difference is in the use of the character ""亚méi"" in the machine translation, which is translated as ""Armenia/Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia

"" in the source. In the reference

translation, this character is replaced with ""俾APO"", which is a more accurate and specific term for the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.

Overall, the machine

translation is close to the reference, but the reference is more precise and accurate.

2. Sentence structure: The machine translation follows the word order of the source text, resulting in a literal but awkward sentence structure. The reference translation restructures the sentence to make it flow more naturally in Chinese.
3. Phrase usage: The reference translation uses the phrase ""进入锦标赛"" (literally ""enter the finals"") to describe the action of making it to the ""tournament"" in a more idiomatic way.

Overall, the reference Translation is more accurate and reads more naturally in Chinese. The machine Translation is correct but lacks the nuances and fluency of the reference Translation.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a few minor differences. Here is a breakdown of the analysis:

1. Terminology:
The source text uses the term ""retriever breeds"" to refer to dogs that are specifically bred for retrieving tasks. Both the machine and reference translations use the correct Chinese term ""检索品种"" (pronounced ""jiéshí pǐn zhǒng"") to translate this concept.
2. Word choice:
The machine and reference translations both use appropriate and similar word choices throughout the sentence. However, the reference translation uses the more formal term ""犬"" (pronounced ""quán"") to refer to dogs, while the machine version uses the more casual ""品种"" (pronounced ""pǐn zhǒng"").
3. Sentence structure:
The sentence structure of the machine and reference versions are very similar, with only slight differences in punctuation and word order.

Overall. the machine's English-to-Chinese translation is quite accurate and closely matches the reference version. However, the use of slightly more formal language in the reference version could be taken into account for future reference.

The machine translation into Chinese produces: ""他变成了一个塔�umuki人, 肚子里塞满了钟"" which literally translates to ""He transformed into a 'ta'nuki person, with a stuffed belly full of clocks"".

The reference (human) translation is: ""它变成了一只肚子里镶有时钟的狸猫"" which literally means ""It transformed into a badger-like creature. with a clock embedded in its stomach"".

Comparing the two Chinese translations, the main difference is that the machine incorrectly identifies the transformed entity as a ""ta'nuki person"" (塔�umuki人) while the reference correctly interprets it as a ""badger-like creature with a clock in its stomach"" (肚子里镶有时钟的狸猫).

The reference correctly interprets the transformed entity as a badger-like creature, which is consistent with the English description of a ""Tanuki with a clock imbedded in its stomach"". However, the machine incorrectly identifies the transformed entity as a ""ta'nuki person"" (塔姨坊人) which is not consistent with the original text.

Moreover, the reference correctly interprets the belly of the transformed entity as ""stuffed with clocks"" (镶有时钟的) while the machine incorrect interprets it as ""full of clocks"" (塞满了钟).

In summary, the reference correctly interprets the transformed entity and the description of its belly, while the machine incorrect interprets the transformed entity and the description of its belly.

 When comparing.the source text to the machine and reference translations, the main difference is in the handling of the authors' names, ""Haroun and R. Chang"".

The source text and reference translation both use the format of "" surnname and surnname"" to link the authors' names, with no comma or conjunction separating them.

However, the machine-generated text separates the two authors' surnnames with a comma, making it read as if it were a list.

The reference-standard format is more appropriate for this context, as it correctly indicates that the two authors belong together as a single entity (a pair of authors working together on the paper, as opposed to a list of unrelated individuals).

Therefore, the reference-standard format is to be preferred, and the machine-generated format is to be corrected to read ""Haroun 和 R. Chang"" (as in the reference-standard format, with no commas or conjunctions separating the two authors' surnnames).

The machine translation is generally accurate, but contains a few errors. The phrase ""split results against Shereef"" in the source text is mistranslated as ""分手"" (fènshǒu), which means ""to part ways"" or ""to break up."" A more appropriate translation would be ""对战"" (duìzhēn), which means ""to face off against"" or ""to do battle with.""

The rest of the machine-generated text is mostly accurate, with the exception of a few minor errors in word order and phrasing. For example, the reference translation correctly places ""11 月"" (shíyí yuè, meaning ""November. the 11th month"") at the beginning of the sentence, while the machine-generated version lists it after ""随后"" (suíhòu, meaning ""thereafter"" or ""subsequently""). Additionally, the reference version correctly uses ""期间"" (qījiān, meaning ""during the period of"") to describe the time frame in which the subject faced off against his opponents, while the machine-generated version simply repeats ""during November"" (11 月的几次比赛中, shíyí yuè de jǐ cì bǐsài zhōng) for each opponent.

Overall, the reference version of the text is more cohesive and natural-sounding, while the machine-generated version contains several errors and awkward phrasings. However, the core meaning of the text is still conveyed in the machine-generated version, and a competent reader of Chinese would likely be able to understand the intended meaning.

However, it differs from the reference translation ""Judoka Majlinda Kelmendi 分别于 2013年和 2014年获得世界冠军，并于 2014年获得欧洲冠军"" in the following ways:

1. Order of information: In the machine translation, the fact that Kelmendi became the European Champion in 2014 is mentioned after she became the World Champion in 2013 and 2014. However, in the reference translation, the information is presented in chronological order, first about becoming the World Champion in 2013, then in 2014, and only then about becoming the European Champion in 2014.
2. Repetition of the verb: In the machine translation, the verb ""成为"" is used twice, which is unnecessary and makes the sentence sound repetitive. In the reference translation, the verb ""获得"" is used only once, which makes the sentence flow better.

These differences result in the machine-generated translation being slightly less clear and natural-sounding than the reference one. However, it is still readable and understandable, which is an important aspect of translation. To improve the quality.

2. ""receives"" is incorrectly translated as ""接收了"" (jieshou le), which sounds unnatural in this context. A better translation would be ""欢收"" (huan shagwel), meaning ""accepted"" or ""admitted"".
3. ""which"" is mistranslated as ""的"" (de), which is used to indicate possession or relationship. A more appropriate word here would be "" après Bree's altercation with Morgan"" which is ""布里与摩根发生争执后"" (Bri vee Morgan zhao sheng zheng zhi hou) in the reference.

 The source text is in English and describes an air attack by Spitfires from 609 Squadron and Hurricanes from 257 and 145 Squadrons on German formations, which is later joined by 238 Squadron.

The machine translation provided is in Chinese. However, there are a few discrepancies between the machine-generated text and the reference (human-generated) text.

1. In the machine-generated text. ""609 个中队的空 firing"" is used to refer to the 609 Squadron. The word ""空 firing"" literally means ""fighting in the air with aircrafts"" in this context, but it is not the correct way to refer to a ""squadron"" in aviation. The reference (human-generated) text correctly uses ""609中队"" to refer to the 609 Squadron.
2. The word ""飓风"" is used to refer to the Hurricanes in the machine-generated text, but it is not the correct word to use in this context. The reference (human-generated) text correctly uses ""飓风"" to refer to the Hurricanes.

Overall, the reference (human-generated) text is more accurate and natural-sounding in its word choices and phrasing compared to the machine-generated one. The reference (human-generated) text also correctly refers to the different units involved in the attack, whereas the machine-generated one makes some errors in this regard.

The reference to the time of the year is expressed more naturally and accurately in the reference version.

2. The verb tense in the machine-generated version is consistent with the English original, but the reference version modifies the verb tense to fit the context of the original text.

In the reference version, the verb ""sailed back/returned back"" is changed to ""返回"" (returned in the reference version, compared to ""启航"" in the machine-generated one, which is more like ""sailed off/departed"").

The reference-provided verb is more fitting in the given context, as it is more likely that the people mentioned in the text had returned to the U.S. from a long voyage, as opposed to just setting sail.

In conclusion, the reference-provided version is more accurate and a better fit for the original English text. The primary differences between the reference and the machine-generated text are the wording and the verb tense, which are more fitting in the reference-provided text. Additionally, the reference-provided text is more accurate in expressing the intended meaning of the original text.

2. Word order: The machine-generated version incorrectly inserts the word ""re-enactment"" (重塑, lit. ""re-sculpting/re-creating"") after the location (内布拉斯加州弗里蒙特, lit. ""Nebraska Fremont""), whereas the reference one correctly positions it at the beginning (开拓者, lit. ""pioneers/pioneer corps/pathfinders/pioneers corps"").
3. Word omission: The word ""artillery battery"" (火炮电池, lit.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same basic information as the source text. However, there are some differences between the two translations.

The main difference is that the machine translation uses the traditional Chinese name for Wimbledon (""温布尔登"" rather than ""威廉����brace�schaft naiden""), while the reference translation uses the simplified Chinese name. by using the traditional Chinese name, the machine Translation is more formal and traditional, while the reference Translation is more streamlined and modern.

In addition, the machine Translation uses the word ""四分之一决赛"" (sì fèn zhī duì sai), which means ""semifinals,"" while the reference Translation uses ""四分AE决赛"" (sì fèn zhī duì sai), which means ""quarterfinals."" The source text uses the English term ""quarterfinals,"" so neither the machine nor the reference Translation is an exact match.

Overall, the machine Translation is accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text, but it uses a more traditional and slightly less accurate term for the tennis tournament. The reference Translation is more accurate in terms of the name of the event, but uses a more streamlined and less traditional name for the round of play.

 The source English text describes an incident. During a gunfight, a bullet fired by Frank hit Holliday's holster and grazed his hip.

The machine translation in Chinese accurately conveys the meaning of the incident, but there is a slight discrepancy in the wording compared to the reference translation.

The discrepancy is in the word ""枪托"" (qiāngtuó) in the machine translation, which refers to a holster or a place to hold bullets, while the reference translation uses ""枪套"" (qiángtào), which specifically refers to a holster for a gun.

Therefore, the reference translation is a more accurate reflection of the meaning of the English text, as it specifically refers to a gun holster, and the machine translation is slightly less precise.

Overall, the difference in the two Chinese translations is minor, and the meaning of the text is still conveyed in the machine-generated version. However, the reference translation is a more faithful representation of the original English text.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same basic information about the source text, namely that actress Audrey Giacomini portrays a character named Jeanne at the age of fifteen.

However, there is a subtle difference between the two translations. The reference translation exactly reproduces the original English text, while the machine translation slightly modifies the wording.

The word ""portrays"" in the source language suggests that the actress is playing the character of Jeanne in a film or a play. However, the verb ""描绘"" (describe/portray) in the machine-generated Chinese text may not convey this meaning as accurately. A more appropriate verb might be ""扮imitate/portray/play the role of"", which conveys the meaning of playing a character more accurately.

Therefore, a more accurate and nuanced Chinese rendering of the original text might be:

 actress 奥黛丽·贾科米尼 在表演 �abienne 以十五岁的年龄.

(Note: In the reference Chinese text, the word ""描绘"" is used, but it may not be the best fit for the meaning of ""portraying a character in a film or play"". Therefore, I provided an alternative and more appropriate rendering of the text in Chinese, which is ""表演"" (perform/portray in a film or play contexts).)

 The source text describes the dimensions of the stone Tablets that God gave to Moses, with measurements given in handbreadths.

The machine translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text, but makes a few errors in the translation of specific words.

1. The name ""Rabbi Meir"" is mistranslated as ""Rabi Mei-er."" In English, the name should be spelled ""Rabbi Meir.""
2. The word ""handbreadths"" is mistranslated as ""handface long"" and ""handface wide."" A more accurate translation would be ""handbreadths long"" and ""handbreadths wide.""
3. The word ""long"" is repeated twice in the reference translation, which is unnecessary.

The reference translation corrects these errors, providing a more accurate translation of the original source.

Here is a corrected version of the machine translation:

Rabbi Meir taught that the stone Tablets that God gave to Moses were each 6 handbreadths long, 6 handbreadths wide, and 3 handbreadths thick.

The reference translation, ""乔纳森在昏迷中看见了往生的超人，并说服他回归，随后清醒过来"", conveys the original meaning of the English sentence, that while in a coma, Jonathan sees and convinces a resurrected Superman to return before awakening.

The reference to the ""afterlife"" in the original sentence is translated as ""余生"" in the machine, but this is not accurate as it implies a different meaning. The reference to the ""afterlife"" is translated as ""往生"" in the reference, which is a more appropriate and accurate choice.

In summary, the main difference between the reference and the machine is the use of the word ""余生"" in the machine, which is not an accurate representation of the ""afterlife"" and the word ""往生"" in the reference, which is a more appropriate and accurate representation of the concept.

53	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The source text is discussing a recast of the role of Sheila Carter, a popular villainess in the daytime soap opera ""The Young and the Restless.""

The machine translation accurately conveys the basic information about a recast of the role of Sheila Carter. However, there are a few differences when compared to the reference translation:

1. Articles: In English, articles (a, an, the) are often omitted in machine-generated translations, leading to a less natural-sounding text. In this case, the indefinite article ""a"" is missing in the machine-generated text before ""white day (daytime).""

Source: The

Machine Translation: 《年轻人和无休止者》

Reference Translation: 《年轻和骚动不安的一族》

2. Word Selection: In the source, ""recast"" is used, but the machine-generated version uses ""重演"" (re-enact), while the reference version uses ""重新演 Person's name"" (re-play the role of the person's name).

Source: The role of... was recast.

Machine Translation: 《年轻人和无休止者》重演了...

Reference Translation: 《年轻和骚动不安的一族》重新演...

3. Word/Phrase Selection: The word ""daytime"" is used in the source to describe the genre of the show, but the machine-generated version mistranslates it as ""白天"" (day/daytime in a literal sense, but not as a genre description in this context). The reference version correctly interprets it as ""日间"" (a genre description for TV/movie/series that airs during the day, as opposed to ""晚间""/evening/primetime series).

Source: the role of popular daytime

Machine Translation: 流行的白天

Reference Translation: 日间

In summary, the machine-generated version conveys the main idea but lacks the nuances and correct word choices compared to the reference. The source and reference share the same meaning, but the reference is more accurate and nuanced.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it omits the word ""attack"" from the phrase ""fierce canon fire attack."" The reference translation includes the word ""attack"". The machine translation renders the phrase as ""fierce canon fire,"" which loses the sense of deliberate action present in the original.

Here are the three translations side-by-side for comparison:

1. Source: At one point he ran through heavy shellfire on an errand.
2. Machine Translation: 有一次他在一次任务中遇到了猛烈的炮火. (Yǒu yī cì tā zài yī cì rènwù zhōng yùdào ledào de miào liáo de pào huo.)
3. Reference Translation: 有一次，他在一次任务中遇到了猛烈的炮火攻击。 (Yǒu yī cì, tā zài yī cì rènwù zhōng yùdào le m liáo de pào huo gong jī.)

The reference and source share the word ""attack"" (攻击, gōng jī in Pinyin, meaning ""attack, offensive, campaign, etc.""), but the machine omits it.

The reference and source also differ in wording. The reference has ""一次任务中"" (yī cì rènwù zhōng, ""one time/mission/task/in the course of one task/during one mission/on an errand/in the midst of one task/on a certain occasion/at one point in time/once/in one instance/on one occasion/once upon a time/...,”) and the source has ""one point in time/at one point/on a certain occasion/at one time/on one occasion/once/in one instance/once upon a time/...,"" represented by ""at one point.""

When comparing the machine translation. ""这座低矮的大厦从周围的房间内启航"" to the reference translation. ""低矮的大厦从周围的物业单位更为突显"", we can see that the machine translation deviates from the reference in terms of meaning.

The source sentence implies that the low building stands out or is prominent among the surrounding tenements. The reference correctly interprets this meaning by using the phrase ""更为突显"" (more clearly shows) to describe the building.

However, the machine-generated text mistranslates the meaning of the original text. Instead of conveying the idea of prominence, the phrase ""从周围的房间内启航"" (departs from the rooms inside the surrounding area) is used, which conveys a sense of movement and change of location.

This error in the machine-generated text is due to the fact that the system failed to understand the meaning of the original text and generated a literal but incorrect interpretation of the words. The reference, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the meaning of the original.

However, there is a slight discrepancy in the word order between the two translations. In the reference translation, the phrase ""1994年"" (which means ""in 1994"") appears at the beginning of the sentence, while in the machine translation, it appears in the middle of the sentence.

In addition, the word ""Scholastic"" is written as ""学术机构"" in the machine translation, whereas in the reference translation, it is left in English. While both translations convey the same meaning, using the original English name for the company in the reference translation may be more appropriate, as it is a well-known brand name.

The machine translation into Chinese is: ""贾克斯离开塔拉后, 她和卡拉卡拉的色情明星伊玛捉住了他"" which translates to: ""After Jax leaves Tara, she and the porn star CaraCara Ima caught him.""

The reference translation. is: ""贾克斯离开塔拉后，她和卡拉卡拉的色情明星伊玛捉住了他"" which also means ""After Jax leaves Tara, she and the porn star Ima, caught him, of CaraCara.""

The main difference between the two Chinese versions is the word order. In the machine-generated version, the phrase ""of CaraCara"" is placed after the name ""Ima"", while in the reference version, it is placed at the very end of the sentence.

The reference version is more faithful to the English original, as it preserves the word order and makes it clear that ""CaraCara porn star"" is a description of the person named ""Ima"" and not a separate entity.

The machine-generated version is still understandable, but it may lead to confusion as to who exactly the ""CaraCara porn star Ima"" refers to. Therefore, the reference version is more accurate and clear.

59	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are in Chinese, so I'm assuming you want me to compare the two translations to the original English source.

The source text in English is: ""The settling of the peninsular standoff now rested with Napoleon III.""

The machine translation is: ""半岛的僵持现在由拿破仑三世来解决.""
(Ban dio de jié chí xiàn zài yú ná pò lún sān shì lái jiě jué.)

The reference translation is identical to the machine translation.

The Chinese translation of the source requires the correct translation of ""settling of the peninsular standoff"" and ""Napoleon III"".

""The peninsular standoff"" refers to the standoff in the Crimean War, which lasted from October 1854 to February 1856, involving Russia on one side, and France, the United Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire on the other side. In this context, ""settling of the peninsular standoff"" refers to the resolution of the conflict.

""Napoleon III"" refers to the French emperor who ruled from 1852 to 1870.

The correct Chinese translation of the source is: ""半岛僵持的危机现在已由拿破仑三世解决。"" (Ban dio jié chí de wēi jī xiàn zài yǐ yú ná pò lún sān shì jiě jiě.)

A comparison of the machine and reference translations shows that neither is accurate. The primary issue with the machine and reference

transcreation is that it fails to convey the meaning of ""settling of the peninsular

standoff"". A correct interpretation of the source material should convey that the conflict has ended, not that it is about to be resolved. The reference and machine

translations both use the character ""僵持"" (jié chí), which means ""to persist in"" or ""to continue to hold on to"", implying that the conflict is ongoing.

Moreover, the reference and machine

translations use the character ""解决"" (jiě jiě), which means ""to solve"" or ""to settle"", but this meaning is inappropriate in this context. A correct interpretation of the source would use a character that conveys the conflict's end, such as ""结束"" (jié shù), ""终结"" (zhong jié), or ""平息"" (píng xiē).

The reference and machine

translations also use the character ""现在"" (xiàn zài), which means ""now"" or ""at present time, "" but this meaning is inappropriate in this context. A correct interpretation of the source would use a character that conveys the conflict's end, such as ""已"" (yǐ), ""conveys that the conflict has ended.

Last, the reference and machine

transcreation use the character ""由"" (yú), which means ""by"" or ""from"", but this meaning is inappropriate in this context. A correct interpretation of the source would use a character that conveys ""was resolved by"", such as ""由"" (yóu), ""由于"" (yóu yú), or ""是"" (shì).

In short, neither the reference nor the machine

transcreation accurately conveys the meaning of the source. A correct interpretation of the source requires conveying that the conflict has ended, not that it is ongoing, and conveying the conflict's end with a suitable character. Additionally, the character conveying ""by"" or ""from"" is inappropriate, and a correct interpretation of the source requires a character that conveys ""was resolved by"".

 The source English text describes a historical event during the Peninsular War when Wellington quickly moved his troops around the city of Ebro and cut off the French retreat to Vitoria at Puente da Arenas.

The machine translation into Chinese provides a literal but inaccurate representation of the original text. The main issue is that the term ""lightning quick march"" is mistranslated as ""威灵顿在埃布罗上空盘旋"" (Wellington in the sky over the Ebro spinning), which is not an appropriate description of the historical event. Additionally, the term "" Puente da Arenas"" is inaccurately translated as ""普恩特达竞技场"" (Puenta de Arenas competition field/arena in a literal sense), which is not a well-known or correct location.

The reference Chinese text provides a more accurate and nuanced portrayal of the historical account. The ""lightning quick march"" is translated as ""迅雷不及掩耳之势"" (a speed and force that cannot be hidden or stopped easily, a more appropriate and vivid description of the situation compared to the literal but less evocative ""威灵顿在埃布罗上空盘旋"" in the machine-generated text). Additionally, the reference text correctly interprets ""Puente de Arenas"" as ""普恩特·达·阿雷纳斯"" (the bridge of Arenas, a well-known and correct location compared to the literal but incorrect ""普恩特达竞技场"" in the machine-generated text).

In summary, the reference text is more faithful to the meaning and cultural nuances of the original English text, and thus, it is a more accurate and nuanced representation of the source material compared to the literal but flawed machine-generated text.

The reference Chinese translation. 弗兰克雇用莎莉在他自己的工厂当监督员，骗过了卡拉 (Fánlánke jí Yòu zài tā zìjǐ de gōngcháng dàng jiān dūyu, piàn guò le Kǎ'er), translates to ""Frank hires Sally to be a supervisor in his own factory, outsmarting Carla.""

When comparing the machine and reference Chinese text, the main difference is that the machine version lacks the word ""outsmarting"" (骗过, piàn guò in Chinese, meaning to deceive, to dupe, to outsmart, to take in) and directly says Frank hired Sally, while the reference text implies that Frank used this move to outsmart Carla.

The reference text is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original English sentence, as it implies Frank's intention to outsmart Carla, not just to hire Sally. The machine version is less nuanced and less reflective of the meaning of the English sentence.

 The machine translation and reference translation differ in several ways. Here. I will break it down step--by-step:

1. Verb used for ""corners him/push him into a corner"":

In the source, the verb ""corners him/pushes him into a corner ""is used to convey the action of confining or pushing the person to a corner.

In the machine-generated text, the verb 弯腰 (wán yāo) is used, which means ""to bend at the waist/to stoop/to bow one's head/to yield to an opponent in a contest/to submit to an enemy ""None of these meanings fit the context of confining or pushing the person to a corner.

In the reference-generated text, the verb 逼 (bì) is used, which is more appropriate in the given context, meaning ""to drive/to push/to squeeze/to force/to corner/to compel/to oblige ""

2. Verb used for ""shower in water/drench in a liquid ""

In the source, the verb ""shower in water ""is used to convey the action of pouring water on the person.

In the machine-generated text, the verb 淋浴 (lín yù) is used, which is not entirely wrong, but it is more appropriate for ""to take a shower ""

In the reference-generated text, the verb 给他洗澡 (gèi tā xǐ zào) is used, which is a more appropriate verb for ""to shower ""

3. The verb used for ""mixed ""

In the source, the verb ""mixed ""is used to convey the action of adding an ingredient to a substance.

In the machine-generated text, the verb 混 (hùan) is used, which is appropriate for ""mixed ""

In the reference-generated text, the verb 掺 (càng) is used, which is a verb for ""to mix ""

Overall, the reference-generated text is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text. The verb choices in the reference-generated text fit the context of the sentence more appropriately. The verb 逼 (bì) is a better fit for confining or pushing the person to a corner, and the verb 给他洗澡 (gèi tā xǐ zào) is a better fit for ""to shower in water ""

The verb 淋浴 (lín yù) is not entirely wrong, but it is more appropriate for ""to take a shower ""

The verb 混 (hùan) is appropriate for ""mixed ""

The verb 掺 (càng) is a verb for ""to mix ""

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Order of elements: by analyzing the reference translation. The letters are on the parapets *above each hangar/机库*. The hangars belong to *Floyd Bent Field/Floyd Bent field*. The English version specifies the ownership relation by placing *Floyd Bent Field* after *each hangar*. However, the machine Chinese version does not reflect this relationship.

My suggestion: 每个机库上方的栏杆上的字母分别拼写着“纽约市”和“Floyd Bent Field下的弗洛伊德·贝内特·菲尔德”。

2. Transliteration of the proper name: the proper name of the place is “Floyd Bennett Field” in the English version. The first word of the proper name is “Floyd”, but the second element is “Bennett” with a double “t”. The current machine version does not reflect the correct spelling of the proper name.

My suggestion: 每个机库上方的栏杆上的字母分别拼写着“纽约市”和“弗洛伊德·beckett·菲尔德场”.

3. Transliteration of the proper name (continued): the proper name of the place is “Floyd Bent Field/弗洛伊德·beckett·菲尔德” in the English version. The last word of the proper name is “Field/菲尔德” in the English version. The current machine version does not reflect the correct spelling of the proper name.

My suggestion: 每个机库上方的栏杆上的字母分别拼写着“纽约市”和“弗洛伊德·beckett·菲尔德场”。

Overall, the current machine version differs from the reference in the proper name spelling and the grammatical relationship of the hangar and the proper name. I suggest correcting the proper name and clarifying the grammatical relationship.

 The source English text describes the meteorological phenomenon of altostratus clouds, which can produce “light continuous or intermittent precipitation.”

The machine translation provided is: 广泛的不透明的阿尔托斯特雷可以产生光连续或间歇性的降水.

The reference translation is: 广泛分布的不透明高层云可产生轻微的连续或间歇性降雨。

Comparing the machine and reference translations to the source text, the primary difference is the lack of specificity regarding the type of clouds being referenced. The reference and source texts both mention “高层云” (high-altitude clouds) specifically, whereas the machine-generated text refers to “不透明的阿尔托斯特雷” (opaque altostratus clouds).

Additionally, the reference and source texts both use the term “降雨” (rainfall or rainstorms) to describe the type of weather phenomenon, whereas the machine-generated text refers to “降水” (rain or snowfall depending on the context, but in this case, it is not clear whether it refers to only rain or to both rain and snowfall due to the lack of specificity in the text provided to the machine-translation system).

Finally, the reference and source texts both use the term “连续” (continuous or consecutive depending on the context, but in this case, it refers to continuous or uninterrupted occurrence of a phenomenon or an event) to describe the type of rain, whereas the machine-generated text refers to “光连续” (bright and continuous depending on the context, but in this case, it is not clear whether it refers to the brightness of the sky or the duration of the phenomenon, or it is a literal translation of the English word ""continuous"" in the source text, which is not the correct meaning in this context, and it is not the correct word to use in the target language, Chinese, in this case, to convey the meaning of the word ""continuous"" in the source text, which is ""连续"" in the reference and source texts, as mentioned earlier in this paragraph).

Overall, the reference and source texts convey the meaning of the source text more clearly and accurately, especially in the use of specific and accurate language, compared to the machine-generated text.

 The machine translation ""在道基, 瓦多不断地寻求超越, 并最终驱赶高山"" slightly differs in meaning from the reference translation ""在Douji, Wado constantly sought to outdo and eventually replace Takayama ""in the following ways:

1. Word Selection:
The word ""oust"" in the reference is more accurately translated as ""取代"" in the reference, but the machine used ""驱赶"" which has a similar meaning but is more commonly used in a more aggressive or violent context.

2. Sentence Structure:
The reference has a more straightforward and clear sentence structure, ""Wado不断试图超越并最终取代Takayama"", while the machine's version is ""在道基, 瓦多不断地寻求超越, 并最终驱赶高山"", which is more wordy and less precise.

3. Sentence Flow:
The reference's version is more coherent and fluent, with the verb ""超越"" (out-compete/out-perform) and ""取代"" (replace/oust) being used together to convey the meaning. The machine's version is less fluent and less clear, with the verb ""超越"" (exceed/out-compete) and ""驱赶"" (oust/expel) being separated by the subject ""瓦多"" (Wado) and the adverb ""不断地"" (constantly/unceasingly).

Overall, the reference's version is more precise, clear, and natural, while the machine's version is less precise, less clear, and less fluent.

The main difference is in the wording of the phrase ""to whom he lost at SummerSlam."" In the reference translation, the pronoun ""he"" appears before the event name ""SummerSlam,"" indicating that the subject of the sentence lost to Edge at that specific event. In contrast, the machine translation places the pronoun ""he"" after the event name, making it sound like the subject lost the event itself, rather than to Edge.

A corrected machine-generated translation could read:

1. Word order: by order of words is different. The reference translation follows the original English sentence more closely, with ""The piglets are"" translated as ""将小猪放在"". The machine-generated translation places the location ""在"" first, resulting in a different sentence structure.

2. Object placement: in the reference translation, the objects ""tree branches,"" ""grass,"" and ""leaves"" (twigs, grass, and leaves) come before the verb ""constructed"" in the original English, indicating that the nest is made of these materials. In the machine-generated version, the characters for ""tree branches,"" ""grass,"" and ""leaves"" appear after the verb, making the structure of the sentence less clear.

3. Word usage: the reference version uses the character ""筑"" which means ""construct"" or ""build"", while the machine-generated one uses ""用"", meaning ""use"".

Overall, the reference version is more faithful to the original text and maintains the correct meaning, as well as preserving the word order and using the appropriate characters.

Original source: In 1969, a Trooper from Air Troop, SFC Rodney J. T. Yano posthumously earned the Medal of Honor.

Reference Translation: In 1969, the soldier Rodney J. T. Yano from the Air Troop was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously.

My Suggested Translation: 1969年，空军师 **""士兵罗德尼尔J.T. Jaho""** � Medal of.

Explanation:

1. I added quotation marks to ""士兵罗德尼尔J.T. Jaho"" to highlight that it is a proper noun and to make it clear that it refers to a specific person.
2. I moved the phrase ""from the Air Troop"" after the name of the person to make the sentence flow more naturally.

Note:

1. In the reference and suggested translations, I used ""was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously"" to convey the meaning of ""posthumously earned the Medal of.
2. I used the passive voice to avoid repeating the verb ""awarded"" and to emphasize the person receiving the honor.

Overall, the machine's. of the English sentence is quite accurate, but the wording and phrasing could be improved to make the sentence more clear and more in line with standard Chinese grammar and usage.

1. Word choice: In the source text. ""hip and ridge flashings"" are replaced with ""lead hip and ridge flashings"" in the reference translation. The machine-generated text omits the word ""lead"" altogether.
2. Word order: In the reference and machine-generated translations, the subject of the sentence is placed at the beginning, unlike the original text, which starts with the verb phrase ""replaced with.""
3. Word form: The reference and machine-generated translations use the character ""部"" (bù) to mean ""part"" or ""component"" after ""lead hip"" and ""ridge flashings/ridge tabs"" respectively, whereas the original source text does not use any such character.
4. Word spacing: The reference and machine-generated translations use a different word spacing for ""galvanized steel equivalent"" compared to the original text.

Overall, the reference and machine-generated texts convey the same meaning as the original, but the reference text is closer to the original in terms of wording and word spacing.

1. Word Choice: The word ""compliment"" in the source text is translated as ""赞美之词"" (zàn méi zī cí) in the machine translation, which is technically correct but sounds stilted and unnatural in this context. A better translation might be ""表扬"" (biǎo yǎng), ""compliments/kudos"" or ""表oli"" (biǎo lì), ""praise"". The reference translation uses ""一赞美之词"" (yī zánméi zī cí), which is more idiomatic and flows better in Chinese.

2.

However, I can assure you that the machine-generated translation is accurate in terms of meaning, but it may not be as fluent or natural-sounding as the reference translation.

When comparing the two translations. I noticed that the machine-generated version uses the character ""铁路"" (tiělu), which means ""railway"" or ""railroad,"" after ""former São Paulo Railway."" In contrast, the reference translation does not include this character. In this context, including ""铁路"" could be seen as redundant, as it is already implied in the name of the former railway.

Therefore, the primary difference between the two translations is stylistic, with the reference version opting for brevity and the machine-generated version including an extra but unnecessary detail. Both versions convey the original English text's meaning accurately.

The machine translation provided is in Chinese, attempting to translate the English names and titles rather than using their Chinese equivalents. ""executive officer Li Si Te Xi Nuo Si Ma Xi Mo Si"" appears to be a literal translation of ""Lactucinus Maximus, consul suffectus"" without considering the cultural and linguistic context of ancient Rome.

The reference translation, on the other hand, provides the Chinese equivalent of the historical figure and title, ""Lactucinus Maximus, consul suffectus"" as ""拉库 ti nuts maxi mus, 公元前 437 年的领事"".

Therefore, the machine translation differs significantly from the reference in terms of fluency, cultural awareness, and accuracy. The reference prioritizes conveying the intended meaning and cultural context, while the machine prioritizes a literal word-for-word translation.

1. Word choice: The term ""改过自新"" (gaiçãoizhèngxin) in the machine-generated text is not an appropriate translation for ""Reformed doctrine of predestination"" as it literally means ""make amends and renew oneself"" in Chinese.

 The machine translation is close to the reference translation, but there are a few differences that make the machine-generated version less clear or natural-sounding in English.

1. In the source, ""Rockies pitcher"" is translated as ""Rockies 投手"" (Ròkiesi dáshou), which is technically correct, but sounds less idiomatic in Chinese. A more common and idiomatic way to say it is ""Rockies 球员"" (Ròkiesi qiúyuán), which means ""Rockies player"" in a broader sense, but is often used to refer to a ""pitcher"" specifically.
2. The phrase ""hit Kolten Wong"" is mistranslated as ""打中了黄科腾"" (dá zhòng le Huángkēwáng), which literally means ""struck and stayed on Wong Kolten's body/equipment/spot/etc."" A more accurate and concise way to say it is ""打中黄科��hen"" (dá zhòng Huángkēwáng), which literally means ""struck Wong Kolten's person/self/body/self-reference/etc.""

Here's a more accurate and fluent version of the Chinese sentence that incorporates the changes I mentioned:

在第七局，Rockies 球员克里斯蒂安·弗里德里希 (Christian Friedrich) 打中黄科腾 (Kolten Wong)。

(Note: I used the pinyin input for the characters, as it is more accessible for many people who can't read the characters directly. The actual written characters for the pinyin input are the same as the original text, except for the word ""黄科腾"" (Huángkēwáng) which is written as ""黄科萍"" (Hwángkēwǎng) in the traditional written style, but the meaning is the same in this context. Also, the word ""球员"" (qiúy

uán) is written as ""球員"" (kyùi-yuán) in the traditional written style, but the meaning is the same in this context. Finally, the word ""投手"" (dáshǒu) is a more specific and less commonly used word for ""pitcher"" in a baseball context, but it is technically correct and can be used in a more professional or academic setting. In everyday conversation, ""球员"" (qiúy

uán) is more commonly used to refer to a ""pitcher"" in a baseball context. However, the word ""投手"" (dáshou) is more commonly used in a broader sense to refer to a ""pitching staff"" in a baseball context, but it is not incorrect to use it to refer to a single ""pitcher"" in a sentence, especially if the word ""球员"" (qiúy

uán) is used in the same sentence to clarify the meaning. Ultimately, the decision of which word to use depends on the level of specificity and the formality of the text, as well as the target audience and the context in which it is used. In this particular case, I used the word ""球员"" (qiúy

uán) to refer to a ""pitcher"" in a more general and everyday conversation sense, but the meaning is the same as the reference text, which used the word ""投手"" (dáshou) to refer to a ""pitching staff"" in a more specific and professional sense. The meaning of the overall sentence is the same in both versions, and the nuances of the choice of words depend on the specific use-case and the target audience, as I mentioned earlier.

The reference Chinese text is 她哥哥帕迪演奏了口琴和曼陀林, which when translated back to English means ""her brother Paddy performed and blew the harmonica and mandolin.""

The difference between the machine and reference text is the word for ""mandolin"" in the pinyin (spelling of the word in the Roman alphabet for pronunciation purposes in the Chinese language, which is written next to the word in the text in parentheses for reference in the text in the case of the reference text, but not in the case of the machine text as it is already written in Chinese characters in the text in the case of the machine text). In the reference, the pinyin is ""曼陀林"" while in the machine, it is ""曼多林"".

The correct pinyin for the word ""mandolin"" is ""曼陀林"" (Màndálín) and not ""曼多林"" (Mànduōlín) as in the case of the machine.

Therefore, the reference and the source texts are the same in meaning, but the machine is different in the word for ""mandolin"" in the pinyin.

Source:

- ""Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin.""

Machine:

Analysis:

- The reference and the source texts convey the same meaning, that the brother of the person in question performed and blew the harmonica and the instrument that is the equivalent of the ""Mandolin"" in the source and reference.
- The machine and reference convey the same meaning, but the word for ""Mandolin"" in the pinyin is incorrect in the case of the machine.

 The machine translation ""这 intentifies 四分之一的 evaluation 为200.1"" is different from the reference translation ""这 intentifies 四分卫 evaluation 为200.1"".

The main issue is that the term ""quarterback rating"" in the source text is not accurately translated in the machine translation. The number 200.1 in the source text refers to a ""quarterback rating"" in the context of American football, which is a measure of a quarterback's performance.

The reference translation correctly renders the concept of ""quarterback rating"" as ""四分卫 evaluation"" (sìfēn wèijué), which is a direct and appropriate translation of the English term.

However, the machine translation mistranslates the concept of ""quarterback rating"" as ""四分之一的评级"" (sìfèn zhī yī de píngbielv), which literally means ""a fraction of one's evaluation of 200.1 points"". This is not an appropriate or meaningful term in the context of the original text.

Therefore, the machine translation is inaccurate and should be revised to reflect the correct meaning of the original text.

The reference version is more specific and accurate, as it clarifies the location to which the squadron sailed, while the machine-generated one simply mentions ""牙买加皇家"" (Jamaica, Royal/King's/Port) without explicitly mentioning the ""港口"" (gǎngk harbor/port).

In summary, the reference (human-generated) version is more precise and accurate, as it clarifies the target destination of the squadron. The machine-generated one lacks that clarity.

 The machine translation ""他选择了《热浪的destroy and 照亮》作为头衔"" is different from the reference translation ""对于标题，他选择了《TheronWare的诅咒与照明》"" in the following ways:

1. Transliteration of title: The reference translation preserves the English title ""The Damnation and Illumination of Theron Ware"" while the machine translation translates it into Chinese.
2. Translation of ""Theron Ware"" : The reference translation has kept the original English name ""Theron Ware"" while the machine translation has not.

The reference and the source text both use the word ""Theron Ware "" in the English spelling, but the machine translation has changed it to ""thermal wave "" in the pinyin.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Order of names: by comparing the machine and reference translations, the reference has reordered the list of band members to ensure that the family name (surnane) appears last, which is the standard order for listing names in Chinese. The machine did not follow this convention.

2. Transliteration of English names: the reference has anglicized the English names of the band members, while the machine has attempted to phoneticize the English names using Chinese characters, which can be difficult to read and understand for a native Chinese reader.

3. Use of parentheses: the reference has used parentheses to clarify the English names corresponding to the abbreviated Chinese names, but the machine has not.

Overall, the reference is clearer, easier to read, and culturally appropriate for a native Chinese reader, while the machine's attempt lacked clarity and readability.

The machine translation renders ""dubbed"".as ""命名为"" (ingly as), while the reference translation correctly translates it as ""命名为一所"" (named one of).

Additionally, the reference translation includes the word ""one"" after ""named as,"" indicating that there are other workplaces that were also named in the same list.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

The reference Translation uses ""战壳"" which means ""war armor/shell/covering"" to convey the meaning of ""battle shells"" in the source. However, the machine-generated Chinese version simply uses ""作战炮弹"" (battle missiles/rockets launching) to translate the English text, which doesn't convey the meaning of ""battle shells"" as accurately.

2. Punctuation: The reference Translation includes punctuation, which is missing in the machine-generated text.

3. Word choice: The reference Translation chooses ""装甲车"" (armored car/tank) to describe the ""battle shells"" in the source, while the machine-generated version simply interprets it as ""炮弹"" (missiles/rockets launching).

Overall, the reference Translation is more accurate and natural-sounding in Chinese, and it conveys the meaning of the original English text more accurately. The machine-generated version lacks nuance and is less precise in conveying the intended meaning.

2. Liturgy: In the source text, ""liturgy"" refers to the forms and practices that are prescribed by churches for public worship. The machine.t. .ation renders it as ""礼仪"" (etiquette or rules of behavior), which is not an accurate translation.

3. Robed male choir: In the source text, the shocking element is that the male choir is wearing robes, which is translated as ""屋顶上的男性合唱团"" (a male choir on the roof) in the machine.t. .anslation. This is a literal translation of the Chinese words but does not convey the intended meaning.

4. ""Papist"": In the source text, the evangelicals see the liturgy and the choir as ""papist,"" which implies that it is associated with the Catholic Church. The machine.t. .ation uses ""纸理"" (literally ""paper/cloth-based things""), which is not an appropriate substitute for ""papist"" and does not convey the intended meaning.

The reference.t. .ation is closer to the intended meaning, using ""陈设"" (furnishings or staging), ""礼拜仪式"" (worship or liturgical practices), and ""教皇至上主义"" (Ultramontanism or papal supremacy/infallibility doctrine) to convey the evangelicals' objections.

 The source sentence expresses the idea that something (e.g., a person or their behavior. actions, or qualities) does not align with the traditional masculine ideals or values associated with machismo.

The machine translation provided is close in meaning to the original English, but has some errors in the word choice and grammatical structure. The term ""大男子主义"" (dà nan zi shi) is commonly used to refer to chauvinistic or macho behavior, but the phrase ""男性化属性"" (nán xìng huà xìng) in the machine-generated sentence is less specific and for that reason sounds slightly awkward or off-base.

The reference (human) English-to-Chinese-translation addresses this issue by using the phrase ""男子气概"" (nán zi qì xiàng), which refers to a traditional, stereotypically ""male"" set of qualities, and is more appropriate for the given context.

Therefore, the reference-quality version of the sentence is:

它不适合男子气概的男性特征。(Ta bù shi shii nán zi qi xiang de nán xing te xing)

This is a subtle distinction, but it is important to note that the reference-level version of the sentence is more precise and culturally appropriate.

 The source text is about the appearance of the character named ""Mystique"" as a zombie in the ""Marvel Zombies"" universe.

The machine-generated Chinese translation reads: ""神秘在马维劳尔僵尸宇宙中出现了两次僵尸"" which literally translates to ""Mystique in the Marvel Zombies universe appeared as a zombie **twice**.""

The reference (human-generated) Chinese text is: ""魔形女在漫威僵尸宇宙中两次作为僵尸出现"" which literally means ""Mystique in the Marvel Zombies universe has appeared twice **in the form of a zombie.""**

The main difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the wording of the verb tense and the word ""times/form/way/etc.""

1. The verb tense:
The reference text correctly employs the verb tense ""has appeared twice in the form of a zombie"" to indicate that the action occurred in the past and continues to have an impact on the present.

The machine-generated text, however, incorrectly employs the verb tense ""appeared twice as a zombie"" to simply describe the occurrence of the action in the past.

Here are some specific issues with the machine translation:

1. The word ""Commonwealth"" is translated as ""英格蘭聯邦"" which is incorrect. A correct Chinese translation of ""Commonwealth"" should be ""英联邦"" or ""公共wealth"".
2. The word ""Graves"" in ""War Graves Commission "" is translated as ""墓"" which is incorrect. A correct Chinese

 The machine translation ""他们留在这里 ， 由混血儿看守。"" differs from the reference translation ""他们留在这里，由工会人员守卫.""

The main difference is in the word choice for the translations of ""confraternities"" and ""members"".

In the machine-generated translation, ""confraternities"" is translated as ""混血儿"", which actually means ""half-caste or mixed-race person"" in Chinese. This is not an appropriate or accurate translation for ""confraternities"" and results in a mistranslation.

The reference (human) translation correctly renders ""confraternities"" as ""工会人员"" (gōnghé rén Yuán), which means ""labor unions or members of a union/guild/confraternity/etc.""

Overall, the reference (human) provides a more accurate and culturally relevant rendering of the original English text compared to the machine-generated version.

The source text states that the Joker represents ""everything Batman opposes"" while both the machine and reference use the phrase ""all that Batman opposes"" (我们常用的中文是“反对的一切/反对的一切 thing”).

The reference and machine both use ""Batman opposes/反对的"" to refer to what the character opposes, but the reference also includes the word ""all/everything"" (所有的/一切) to emphasize the extent of what the Joker represents.

The machine's use of the word ""一切"" is correct, but the word ""all that/一切"" is missing in the first part of the sentence, which slightly weakens the emphasis on the extent of what the Joker represents.

 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is in the word ""vengeance."" by translating it word-for-word, the machine loses the nuanced meaning of the English word.

A better, more nuanced approach would be to understand the overall meaning and intent of the sentence, and convey that meaning as closely as possible in the target language.

A suggested revision to the machine-generated Chinese might be:

""她告知了Necrafa新的Mysticons，并与她一起仇杀。""

Here, the word ""�rimgeance"" is translated as ""仇杀"" (chou sha) to convey the idea of seeking revenge.

It is important to note that the reference Chinese text also differs slightly from the English, in that it interprets ""vengeance"" as ""复仇"" (fu chou) - literally, ""revenge-kill"" - which is a more direct and literal interpretation of the word.

In any case, the key is to convey the overall meaning and intent of the English sentence, and not just to perform a literal word-for-word interpretation.

The reference and machine versions share the same basic structure, listing the name of the historical figure (Gnaeus Cornelius L. f. L. n. Lentulus) and describing his role as a consul in 201 BC and one of the triumvirs responsible for leading new colonists to Narnia.

However, the machine version contains one error that is not present in the reference version. In the description of Lentulus's role as a triumvir, the word ""appointed"" is mistranslated as ""被任命"" (bèirènmìng), which literally means ""was appointed"" but is redundant in this context. A correct rendering of the word in this context should be ""任命"" (rènmìng), meaning ""appoint/nominate/elect [someone] as [something].""

Thus, the reference and machine versions differ slightly in the accuracy of their grammatical structures and word choices. The reference is more precise and faithful to the original text.

The reference Translation used ""颤音 (yíngyīn)"" which means tremolo, but the Source text mentioned ""quavers"" which means a musical note with the duration of an eighth of a whole note.

The pedal is likely referring to a pedal in a piano or organ, and the ""cross motif in quavers "" is a sequence of 8th-note notes that appear throughout the piece.

The reference Translation is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text, as it used the correct word for the ""quavers "" and "" pedal "" in the context of a musical composition.

In summary, the main difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the incorrect use of the word ""码头 "" in the machine-generated version, and the reference 's use of ""颤音 "" to refer to the "" pedal "" in the composition.

1. Order of names: by convention, names in Chinese follow the surname first and then the given name. In the reference translation, ""Dionysius Williams"" is correctly translated as ""威廉姆斯·狄奥尼"". However, the machine incorrectly reversed the order of the name to ""穆利翁的迪奥尼修斯"".
2. Possessive form: the reference correctly uses the possessive form ""Mullion's Dionysius Williams"" to indicate ownership, but the machine incorrectly omits the possessive form and simply writes ""穆利翁的迪奥尼修斯"".
3. Word choice: the reference chooses the word ""捕捞物"" (catch, haul) to describe the goods that were sent, but the machine incorrectly chooses the word ""catch"" (捕获, to catch or arrest someone) and translates it as ""迪奥尼修斯·威廉姆斯通过轮船从海尔到布里斯托尔捕获（捕获）"".

These differences, while minor. can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. Therefore, it is essential to use a professional human translator for important or official documents.

2. Translation of ""accompaniment to a curried dish"". The machine has translated this as ""作为咖哩菜的伴奏"" (weishengren wei kaolin de bandzou), which literally means ""as a curry's accompaniment"" but the reference has used a more appropriate ""佐餐"" (zuocan) meaning ""to accompany as a side dish/to go with a dish/to complement a dish ""

3. The term ""dipping sauce "" in the source is mistranslated as ""甜食"" (tian shi) meaning ""sweets/dessert "" in the machine, while the reference has used a more appropriate ""沾甜味酱"" (zhan tian wei jiang) meaning ""sweet dipping sauce ""

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the main idea of the source text, which is about an argument between an actress and a director during filming, leading to the actress spitting at the director out of disgust.

However, there is a slight discrepancy between the two translations. In the machine translation, ""spitting at him in disgust"" is translated as ""厌恶地对他吐痰"" (yànè de duòtù), while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""厌恶地对他吐口水"" (yànè de tuō kǒushuǐ).

Here, the difference lies in the phrase ""吐痰"" (tuè) and ""吐口水"" (tuō kǒushuǐ). Both phrases can be translated as ""spitting at someone/something"" in English, but they convey slightly different meanings.

""吐痰"" (tuè) literally means ""to spit phlegm or saliva out of one's mouth due to illness or anger, etc."" It implies that the person is in a bad mood, angry, or sick.

On the other hand, ""吐口水"" (tuō kǒushuǐ) literally means ""to spit out saliva or water from one's mouth due to anger, disgust, or disdain, etc.""

In this context, the reference translation is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text, as the actress was spitting at the director out of disgust, not because of illness. Therefore, ""吐口水"" (tuō kǒushuǐ) is a better choice than ""吐痰"" (tuè) in this case.

Moreover, the reference translation is more concise and natural-sounding in English, as it avoids repeating the word ""director/导演"" twice.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and nuanced in conveying the meaning of the original text, and it is also more concise and fluent in English.

However, there is a subtle but important difference in the way the two translations render the phrase ""once again"" in the context of the invasion being halted.

The reference translation uses the character  ""(hòu zài)"" which means ""once again,-- yet again, anew, still"".

While the machine-generated version is not technically incorrect, it may convey a slightly different meaning to a reader who is not familiar with the historical context.

The reference version emphasizes that the invasion was halted, but the word ""stalled "" in the original text implies that the halt in the invasion was unexpected, and possibly temporary.

The reference version captures this nuance by using the word ""再次 "" (once again, anew) to suggest that the halt in the invasion was unexpected, and that it may resume at any moment.

The machine-generated version, on the other hand, simply suggests that the invasion was halted, but does not convey the temporary or unexpected nature of the halt.

Therefore, while the machine-generated version is not technically incorrect, it may be considered less nuanced and less nuanced in its meaning compared to the reference version.

3. Word omission: The verb ""led(领衔)"" is not enough to reflect the meaning of ""leading the team with the top stats in the category mentioned in the source text, which is ""54yards on 9 carries"". A correct verb should reflect the action of carrying the ball, such as ""进洞(jìn dòng) "" in the reference sentence.
4. Word form: The measure word ""number(号)"" next to ""9 carries(9号车上)"" is not suitable, as it should be replaced by ""ball-carrying occasions(球进洞) "" to reflect the meaning of ""times a player carried the ball "" in the category.

Therefore, the reference sentence conveys the meaning of the original text more accurately, and the machine-generated sentence contains several errors.

 The source text describes a person's drug use after the year 1967, including cannabis/marijuana, hashish, LSD, and amphetamines.

The machine translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text, but there is a repeated phrase ""and hashish / 大麻"" in the Chinese translation, which is unnecessary and redundant. In the reference translation, ""麻药"" is used to refer to both cannabis and hashish, which is a more appropriate and concise translation.

Therefore, a better translation of the source text could be:

Here, ""大麻"" refers to cannabis, and ""麻酮"" refers to amphetamines. The phrase ""迷魄药"" is used to refer to both LSD and amphetamines, and the phrase ""尤其是"" is used to emphasize the connection between the drug use and touring.

 Both the machine and reference translations are generally accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. However, there are a few minor differences between them.

The main difference is in the translation of the phrase ""reactionary bulwark."" In the machine translation, it is translated as ""反动的堡垒"" (fǎndòng de bǎomuq Ren), while in the reference translation, it is rendered as ""反动的堡垒"" (fǎndòng de bǎomuq Ren) as well. Both translations are technically correct, but the reference translation uses simplified Chinese characters, while the machine translation uses traditional Chinese characters. Simplified Chinese characters are used in Mainland China, while traditional Chinese characters are used in Taiwan, as well as in some overseas Chinese communities.

The second difference is in the rendering of ""somber priests"" and ""festooned soldiers."" In the machine translation, they are translated as ""阴沉的牧师"" (yīnchén de mùshǐ) and ""精疲力尽的士兵"" (jǐngpí lìjìn de shìbīng), respectively. While the reference translation renders them as ""阴沉的牧师"" (yīnchén de mùshǐ) and ""精疲力尽的士兵"" (jǐngpí lìjìn de shìbīng) as well. Both sets of terms convey the intended meaning, but the reference translation uses traditional Chinese characters, while the machine-generated one uses simplified Chinese characters.

Overall, the machine-generated and reference-generated Chinese characters both convey the intended meaning of the original English text, but the reference-generated text is written in the style preferred in Taiwan and some other Chinese-speaking communities, while the machine-generated one is in the style preferred in the Chinese-speaking communities of the Chinese mainland and some other regions.

2. Terminology: The term ""ghouls"" is not accurately reflected in the machine's output. The reference and source both use ""食尸鬼"" (shí shī guǐ) to refer to the creatures, which is closer to ""reanimated corpses/zombies/revenants"" in English.

3. Verb Usage: The verb ""is carried away by the hordes and is [..] and is [..] and is [..]"" is not an appropriate way to convey the meaning in the reference. The verb ""is carried away by the hordes and is [..]"" is redundant and confusing.

4. Sentence Structure: The sentence is not a literal word-for-word or character-for-character equivalent of the reference, but it conveys the same meaning.

The machine translation into Simplified Chinese accurately conveys the main idea of the source text, namely that Ricky Hatton successfully defended his boxing title by knocking out his opponent. However, there are a few differences between the machine-generated translation and the reference translation that impact the overall quality of the Chinese version.

One difference is that the machine-generated version renders ""Ring light welterweight crown/title/championship"".as ""环球轻量级冠军杯"" (huánqiú qíngliáo jíngjiàn bēi), whereas the reference version renders it as ""环球轻中量级冠军"" (huánqiú qīng zhōngliangjí jíngjùn). Here, the reference version is more accurate, as the term ""crown/title/championship "" is better translated as ""冠军"" (jíngjùn) in this context, and ""level/division"" is better rendered as ""级别"" (jíbié) or ""级 weights "" (jízhòng) in Chinese.

Another issue is that the machine-generated version does not include the proper name of the opponent, ""José Luis Castillo,"" rendering it as ""何塞·路易斯·卡斯蒂略"" (hé suŏ lùyì sī kázítèliáo) in pinyin. In contrast, the reference version includes the proper name of the opponent, ""何塞·路易斯·卡斯蒂略"" (hé suǒ lùyì sī kázítèliáo) in simplified Chinese.

Last but not least, the source English sentence contains the verb ""defeats"" to describe the action of the fight, but the machine-generated version renders it as ""在击斗"" (zài jí dòu in pinyin, meaning ""fighting"" or ""battling"" in a general sense, but not specifically ""defeating"" or ""knocking out"" in a competitive context.

In summary, the machine-generated version conveys the main idea of the original text, but it contains several errors and omissions that make it less accurate and natural-sounding than the reference version.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation and accurately conveys the main idea of the source text. However, there are a few minor differences that make the machine-generated translation sound a little awkward in Chinese.

1. Word order: The word order in the machine-generated Chinese sentence is correct, but it sounds a bit unnatural compared to the reference translation. In the reference, the subject ""Ricimer"" is placed after the verb phrase ""将他罢免"" (fired him in English) to emphasize the agency of Ricimer in removing Anthemius from his position.
2. Punctuation: The punctuation in the machine-generated sentence is correct, but the reference sentence has a slightly different punctuation. The reference sentence has a full stop at the end, indicating that it is a complete sentence, while the machine-generated sentence has a period in the middle, implying that it is a fragment.
3. Sentence structure: The sentence structure in the reference is more varied and more nuanced, with the use of passive and active verbs. The passive verb ""被免职"" (literally, ""was dismissed from his post"" in the machine-generated sentence) is replaced with the active verb ""将 him dismiss"" in the reference, which makes the sentence more engaging and dynamic.

In summary, the machine-generated sentence is accurate but lacks the nuance and sophistication of the reference. The reference is more nuanced and engaging, with a more varied sentence structure and a more deliberate use of passive and active verbs.

 The source text in English is about the next five possessions in a game ending in punts. The machine translation in Chinese provided by you seems to be a literal translation of the phrase ""ended in punts"" as ""以拳击手告终,"" which is inaccurate.

Punts here refer to a specific action in American football, which is when the ball is dropped and kicked before it hits the ground. The phrase ""five possessions ended in punts"" means that the team had five opportunities. They advanced the ball down the field but ultimately chose to punt it away to the opposing team.

However, the machine-generated Chinese phrase ""以拳击手告终"" literally translates to ""with boxers ending in punches"" in English, which is not related to the original meaning.

The reference Chinese text ""接下来的五个动作以球未落地前踢出告终"" accurately conveys the meaning of the original text. The term ""五个动作"" refers to the five possessions, and ""球未落地前踢出"" refers to the action of punting the ball away.

In contrast, the machine-generated text is not an accurate representation of the original meaning and may lead to confusion for the reader. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the generated text accurately reflects the meaning of the original text.

Source: Jíbartia a sandwich using ripe sweet plantains as bread.

Machine Translation: Jǐbá tiá shì yīgè sānmiànzhí, yòng chéngshuǎng de tián cài zuò miànbāo. (Simplified Chinese)

Reference Translation: Jíbá tiá shì yīgè sānmiànzhī, yòng chéngshú de tiáncài zuò miànbāo. (Simplified Chinese)

The source text is in English and describes making a sandwich called ""Jíbartia"" with sweet, ripe plantains as the bread.

The machine-generated and reference Chinese translations both convey the main idea of making a ""sandwich"" or ""three-layered snack"" (三明治/sān míng zhī) with ripe sweet plantains as the ""bread"" or wrapping.

However, the main difference between the machine-generated and reference versions lies in the term for ""sandwich/three-layered snack"" used. The reference version uses ""sānmiànzhī"" (三明治), which is the standard Chinese term for ""sandwich"" or ""three-layered snack/burrito."" The machine-generated version, ""jǐbá tiá"" (吉巴提�� Columbia clothing), is incorrect.

The reference and machine-generated versions share the same wording for the sweet, ripe plantains (""chéngshú de tiáncài"" / 成熟的甜菜), which is accurate.

In summary.

* The reference and machine-generated versions both convey the correct meaning of the original English sentence.
* However, the machine-generated version contains an error, mistaking the name of the snack for a clothing brand.

The overall quality of the machine-generated version is not ideal due to the inaccuracy. It correctly conveys the meaning of the sentence but contains an unrelated error.

The reference (human-generated) Chinese translation is: ""矩阵计算将传统分析概念, 如微分和指数, 推广到更高的维度.""

Comparing the two Chinese translations, the reference one is more accurate and fluent.

The main difference between the machine and reference Chinese versions is the wording of the term ""classical analytical notions/concepts"" in the English text.

The machine-generated version used ""经典的分析概念"" (classical analytical concepts) while the reference used ""传统分析概念, 如微分和指数"" (traditional analysis concepts, such as differentials and exponentials).

The reference version is more precise and easier to understand for a Chinese reader, as it explicitly lists the specific concepts (differentials and exponentials) that are being referred to.

Moreover, the reference version is more concise and fluent, as it avoids repeating the subject ""concepts"" and directly mentions the specific traditional concepts.

In contrast, the machine-generated version is less clear and less precise, as it only vaguely refers to ""classical analytical concepts"" and does not explicitly specify the exact concepts being referred to.

2. Word selection:
The word ""EF1"" is left in English in the machine-generated sentence, while the reference sentence has translated it to ""EF1级"" (EF1-level tornado/tornadoes of EF1 intensity on the Fujita scale, which measures tornado intensity).

3. Word omission:
The word ""级"" (level) is missing in the machine-generated sentence, which is present in the reference sentence.

4. Sentence fluency:
The reference sentence is more coherent and fluent, with a clear emphasis on the tornado and the extent of the damage. The machine-generated sentence is less clear and less emphatic.

5. Word-for-word errors:
The word ""still"" is missing in the reference sentence, but it is present in the source sentence. The word ""still"" is not translated in the reference sentence, but the machine-generated sentence includes it, which is unnecessary and confusing.

A correct and improved version of the sentence, based on the reference and the source, is:

""在路易斯安那州，三个单独的EF1级龙卷风破坏了德里德附近的几所房屋，并吹倒了许多树木。""

(Three separate, EF1-level tornadoes destroyed several homes and knocked down many trees near DeRidder, Louisiana.)

I apologize for the mistake in the previous response. I accidentally pasted an unrelated text.

The correct response to the question is:

The machine-generated text contains a few errors.

1. ""贝壳"" (bèiké) is a general, non-specific word for ""seashells"" in Chinese, while the reference text specifies ""limpets and barnacles"" (帽贝和藤壶, màobèi hé téng).

2. ""较低层"" (jiàodǐcéng) is not a standard or appropriate geological or geographical expression, and it is not clear what exactly it refers to. The reference text correctly refers to ""the lower rocks/cliffs/rocky shores"" (海滩, 海岸, 海斛, depending on the context, but it is not a major error in the machine-generated text either, as it is still a literal rendering of the original English text, so it is not a major error in the machine-generated text either.

1. Measure words: In the machine-generated version, the measure word ""次"" (times) is missing in the description of the second occurrence of the ""Blue Jays"" (蓝箭队/Lán jiàn duì).

Reference: 蓝鸟队 (Lán niǎo duì)

Machine: 蓝箭队 (Lán jiàn duì)

2. Word form: The word ""played"" in the original text is translated as ""在...比赛"" (zà...bǐ sài) in the reference version, meaning ""to play in a competition/game/match"". However, the machine-generated text renders it as ""再次在...比赛"" (zàicí zài...bǐ sài) meaning ""to play again in a competition/game/match"". The addition of ""再次"" (zài cì) in the machine-generated version slightly alters the meaning of the text, implying that the ""Blue Jays"" and the ""Tampa Bay Rays"" have faced each other more than once.

3. Word omission: The word ""against"" in the reference text is missing in the machine-generated text.

Reference: 对阵 (duì zhalls)

Machine: 在 (zài)

Overall, the machine-generated text conveys the main idea of the reference and the original text, but it differs slightly in meaning and style. The reference and the machine-generated text both correctly convey the idea of the ""Blue Jays"" facing the ""Tampa Bay Rays"" in a game, but the reference is more precise and nuanced. The reference also correctly conveys the meaning of the word ""against"" and the number of occurrences of the ""Tampa Bay Rays"" and the ""Blue Jays"" facing each other. The machine-generated version is less nuanced and slightly inaccurate in meaning and word use.

The reference (human) translation is ""��oid排泄物中的水渗入管道中，并沿着管道进入渠渠,"" which literally means ""Water from the mole (mole) drains seeps into the pipes and runs along the pipes into the ditch through the pipes.""

The main difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the lack of the word ""through the pipes"" in the latter. The reference text explicitly states that the water is not just running along the pipes, but also through the pipes and into the ditch. The machine-generated version lacks this nuance, and simply states that the water is running into the ditch.

When comparing the machine translation to the reference translation. We can see that the machine has translated ""dwarves"".as ""矮人的道路"" (way/road of the dwarves) instead of just ""矮人"" (dwarves/dwarfes).

The word ""Silmaril"" is a fictional object in the universe of J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of the source sentence, it is not a standard English word. The reference Chinese text has used ""精灵宝钻"" (literally ""spirit gem-drill"") to translate it, while the machine has used the pinyin of the word ""Silmaril"" directly.

The reference Chinese version has used ""卢西恩"" (Lúthien) while the machine has used ""卢森"" (Lúshèn).

Overall, the reference and the machine's version differ in the way the proper noun ""dwarves"" and the fictional object ""Silmaril"" are represented, and the spelling of the name ""Lúthien"". The reference is more adapted to the context and the target language, while the machine is more literal.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are quite close to the original English sentence in meaning. However, there is a slight discrepancy between the two Chinese translations regarding the use of quotation marks.

In the reference translation, the term ""Wimbledon"" is placed within quotation marks, indicating that it is a proper noun or a name of a specific event. However, in the machine-generated version, the equivalent Chinese characters for ""Wimbledon"" lack the quotation, and thus the distinction is lost.

The quotation of ""Wimbledon"" is essential to avoid confusion and ensure the reader understands that the text refers to a proper noun, specifically the world-famous tennis grand slam.

Therefore. the machine-generated version slightly differs from the reference, and the latter is more preferable in this case.

The machine translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, but there are a few differences when compared to the reference translation.

One difference is that the machine..1. 

English

Nearly every title game from 1933 to 1946 featured either the Giants or Redskins from the East against either the Bears or Packers from the West.

Chinese

从 1933 年到 1946 年 ， 几乎每一场冠军赛都有来自东方的巨人或红皮肤对抗来自西方的熊 oder 包装公司的特色。

In the source and reference text, the word ""title game"" refers to the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL) in the United States. However, the concept of ""title game"" might not be familiar to Chinese readers, so the term ""championship game"" is used in the reference text.

Another minor issue is that the word ""Redskins"" is used in the original text to refer to a football team, but it is a controversial and potentially offensive name for a sports team. The reference text avoids using this name and instead refers to the ""红皮队 (the literal meaning of ""the skin team"")"" in the reference text.

Lastly, the word ""featured"" is translated differently in the reference and machine text. The reference text uses ""以...为特色 (yǐ...wéi téxiàng)"" to convey the meaning of ""featured"" in the original text, but the machine text incorrectly interprets it as ""有...对抗 (yǒu...duìkàng)"" which has a different meaning of ""facing off against"" or ""confonting"".

In summary, the reference and machine texts both convey the meaning of the original text, but the reference text is more culturally appropriate and accurately interprets the meaning of the word ""featured"" in the original text.

For example, ""reemerged"" in the source text is translated as ""再次出现"" (re-appear) in the machine-generated text, while a more appropriate word might be ""再次出身"" (re-emerge/reappear).

2. Word order: The word ""world"" in the original text is used as an adjective to describe the ""Heavyweight Championship"" in the English text. However, the machine-generated text does not reflect this and simply inserts the word ""世界"" (world) as a separate noun.

3. Sentence structure: The structure of the sentence in the machine-generated text is slightly different from the reference text, leading to a less clear meaning.

Overall, the machine-generated text conveys the main idea of the original text, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference text. A more accurate and nuanced English-to-Chinese translation might be:

(Note: The word ""自然"" (nature) in the original English source is likely a misprint and should be ""WWF"" or ""WWE"" as it refers to the wrestling organization. However, the original text is not clear in this regard, so the word is not included in the revised text.

Reference and source texts use punctuation to separate the year from the main sentence, while the machine translation combines the year and the sentence together.

2. Word choice: The word ""headed down"" is used in the source to describe the direction of the movement, but the machine-generated text uses ""向...进发"" (forward...proceed) to convey the same meaning.

The reference and the source use the phrase ""沿着...前进"" (march along... in the reference and in the source, respectively) to convey the same meaning.

1. Petrova's name: In the original English text, the person's name is ""Petrova,"" but the machine has translated it to ""Petrova"" which is the correct rendering of the name in Pinyin (the official Romanization system for Standard Chinese).

Comparison:

- English (source): ""Petrova partnered with Huber and Anastasia Rodionova.""
- Machine Translation: ""Petrova 与 Huber 和 Anastasia Rodionova 结成伙伴关系。""
- Reference Translation: ""佩得洛娃与胡贝尔和阿纳斯塔西娅·罗迪����onava 结成伙伴关系。""

In the reference, the name ""Petrova"" is localized to ""佩得洛娃"", which is a direct phonetic rendering of the English name in Chinese.

2. Punctuation: The reference text contains a comma after the year ""2011 年"" (2011 year in the reference text and the machine-generated text lack this punctuation.

Difference:

- English (source): ""In 2011, Petrova partnered with Huber and Anastasia Rodionova.""
- Machine Translation: ""2011 年 ， Petrova 与 Huber 和 Anastasia Rodionova 结成伙伴关系。""
- Reference Translation: ""2011年，佩得洛娃与胡贝尔和阿纳斯塔西娅·罗迪����onava 结成伙伴关系。""

The reference and the source share the same format, including the year, but the punctuation differs in the machine-generated text.

The machine and reference translations both convey the main idea of the events in the original text. However, there are some differences in the word choices and sentence structure.

In the machine-generated text, the word 当 (dāng) is used at the beginning of the sentence, meaning ""when"" or ""at the time when."" In contrast, the reference text omits this word, making the sentence more concise.

The word 得 (dé) in the machine-generated version is used to mean ""to learn"" or ""to find out."" In the reference version, 得 is replaced with 知 (zhí), meaning ""to know"" or ""to be aware of.""

The word 一次对峙 (yīcì duìjié) in the machine-generated version is a more verbose and less commonly used phrase for ""a confrontation"" compared to the reference's use of 而 (ér), which is a more straightforward and commonly used word for ""and.""

The word 打 (dǎ) in the machine-generated text is used to mean ""to hit"" or ""to slap"" while the reference text simply states 打 (dǎ) as 了 (le), which is a punctuation symbol in the reference version.

Overall, the reference and machine-generated versions both convey the meaning of the original text, but the reference is more concise and commonly used in everyday language. The machine-generated version is slightly more verbosely and less commonly used, but still conveys the meaning of the text.

When comparing the two Chinese translations. We can observe that the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine-generated one.

The primary issue with the machine-generated text is that it literally translates ""ye"" to ""you"" (你们) and ""timpani"" to ""timpani"" (��itimpanili), which results in a less-fluent and less-culturally-sensitive text.

The reference text, on the other hand, correctly interprets the imperative ""Sound off"" as ""大声叫喊"" (dàsheng jiào hán), meaning ""Shout loudly/yell loudly"" and replaces ""ye/you"" with an exclamation, which is more culturally appropriate and more in line with the intended meaning. Additionally, the reference version omits the redundant ""ye/you"" (你们) and directly refers to the ""timpani"" (��itimpanili) in the imperative, which is more concise and accurate.

Overall, the reference version is more culturally and linguistically sensitive, while the machine-generated one is a literal and less nuanced interpretation of the English text.

The primary issue with the machine-generated Chinese text is that it uses non-standard characters and ordering. Specifically:

However, it is always recommended to compare the machine-generated text with reference or professional human-generated text to ensure that the nuances, idioms, and cultural references are taken into account.

In this specific case, the source and target languages are English and Chinese, respectively, and the sentence is quite straightforward. Therefore, the machine has done a decent job in replicating the reference text.

However, it is important to note that this is not always the case, especially for more nuanced, culturally-sensitive, or technically challenging texts. Therefore, it is advisable to use caution and always compare the output of a machine to a reference or a competent human evaluator.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"

 The source text is comparing the size of the antlers and canines in muntjac and tufted deer. However, the machine translation has mistranslated ""antlers"". Instead of translating ""antlers"".as ""鹿角"" (lú jiào), the machine has translated it as ""蚂蚁"" (má yí), which actually means ""ants"" in English.

The reference Translation correctly interprets ""antlers"" as ""鹿角"" (lú jiào).

Moreover, the word ""canines"" in the source is also not accurately reflected in the machine-generated text. The reference text correctly interprets ""canines"" as ""犬牙"" (qiáng yá).

Overall, the reference text is a more accurate and faithful representation of the original English text compared to the machine-generated text.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a few minor differences in wording and tone.

1. Word choice: The word ""道德"" in the machine-generated translation is somewhat ambiguous and could be translated as either ""moral"" or ""ethical"" in English. However, the reference version specifically uses ""道德感"" (literally ""sense of ethics"" or ""moral sense"") to describe Scrooge's development.

2. Slight change in word order: The reference version places the subject ""史高治"" (Scrooge) at the beginning of the sentence, while the machine-generated one starts with the location ""在罗莎的带领下"" (Under Rosa, i.e. under the guidance of Rosa/Rosa's management/leadership).

3. Slight difference in tone: The reference version sounds more natural and conversational, while the machine-generated one is slightly more literal and stilted.

Overall, the machine-generated version conveys the original meaning well, but the reference one flows better and captures the nuances of the original text more accurately.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are accurate in conveying the meaning of the original English source. However, there is one minor difference between the two.

The difference lies in the use of parentheses in the machine translation. In the original English source, the phrase ""toward the Gulf of Tehuantepec"" modifies the verb ""moved"" and clarifies which body of water the cloudiness is approaching. In the machine-generated Chinese text, the phrase ""向特万特佩克湾"" (toward the Gulf of Tehuantepec) is placed in parentheses, indicating that the information is not essential to the meaning of the sentence.

In contrast, the reference Chinese text does not use any punctuation or other marks to indicate the non-essential status of the clarifying information.

While the use of the parenthesized clarification in the machine-generated text is not incorrect, it is not consistent with the conventions of written Chinese, which tends to avoid using parenthesized text in favor of clear, straightforward proccisness.

Therefore, the reference text is a more accurate and culturally appropriate reflection of the original English text.

1. Word choice: The phrase ""sketches and paintings"" in the source text was translated as ""草图和编织工"" (cáotuó hé zhīzhuó gōng) in the machine translation, which does not make sense in Chinese. A more appropriate translation could be ""素描和绘画"" (sùxie hé Huìhuà), which is used in the reference translation.

2. Word order: In the source text, the phrase ""weavers and their cottages"" is separated by ""and"", indicating that the cottages belong to the weavers. However, in the machine translation, the phrase is translated as ""编织工及其家庭的画作"" (Zhīzhuó gōng jí qie jiā tái Huìhuà), which suggests that the cottages belong to the paintings, rather than the weavers. In contrast, the reference translation correctly renders the relationship between the two phrases as ""织工和他们的农舍"" (Zhīgōng hé tāmen de nóng).

3. Sentence structure: In the reference translation, the verb phrase ""finished quickly"" is translated as ""很快地完成了"" (Hěn kuài de wánchéng le), which is more appropriate in Chinese compared to the literal word-for-word rendering in the machine translation.

Overall, the reference-level human-generated Chinese-language reference is more nuanced and accurate in its word choices and sentence structure compared to the literal and less nuanced word-for-word rendering of the source English-language text by the machine-generated machine-translation.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a few minor differences that could affect the meaning.

1. Order of words: In the machine translation. the word order differs slightly from the reference and the source, but it does not significantly impact the meaning.
2. Repetition of characters: In the machine-generated Chinese text, the character ""偷"" (tou) is repeated twice, which is unnecessary and makes the sentence sound awkward. In the reference, the repetition is avoided, and the sentence flows better.
3. Translation of ""ambushing good citizens"": The reference and the source both use the phrase ""伏击良好公民"" (fuchi liang hao gongmin) to describe the ambushing of good citizens. However, the machine-generated text uses a slightly different phrase, ""伏击好人"" (fuchi haoren), which may not convey the same meaning as the reference and the source.
4. Translation of ""steal their belongings/plunder their wealth"": The reference and the source both use the phrase ""偷走他们的财物"" (tou zou ta men de caiwu) to convey the idea of stealing or plundering the belongings of the victims. However, the machine-generated text omits the word ""财"" (cai, meaning ""money"" or ""financial resources"") and only uses the word ""走"" (zou, meaning ""to leave"" or ""to run away with something""). This may lead to a less clear meaning and a less accurate representation of the original text.

In summary, the machine-generated text is quite similar to the reference and the source, but it contains some minor errors and omissions that could impact the meaning. The reference and the source both use more precise and unambiguous language to convey the meaning, and the machine-generated text should strive to follow their example.

 The source English text states that in August 1843, Smetana left for Prague with twenty gulden and had no immediate prospects.

The machine translation into Chinese provides a literal but incomplete translation of the source English text. The translation is: ""1843 year 8 month, Smetana carrying 20 gulden left Prague, without any immediate prospects.""

The reference Chinese text, on the other hand, is more nuanced and accurate. The reference text is: ""1843 year 8th month, Smetana carrying 20 gulden set off for Prague, although at that time, the hope was dim.""

The main differences between the reference and the machine-generated text are:

1. The reference text includes the word ""set off"" (出发) to indicate the beginning of a journey, while the machine-generated version does not.
2. The reference text clarifies that the destination of the journey is ""set off for Prague"" (前往布拉格), but the machine-generated version simply has ""left (离开) Prague.""
3. The reference text explicitly states that ""the hope was dim (although at that time, the hope was dim)"" (although at that time, the hope was dim), but the machine-generated version lacks this nuance.

However, there are some differences between the two translations.

1. Articles: In English, articles (a, an, the) are often used to specify nouns. Both Chinese languages (Simplified and Traditional) don't have articles. The reference Chinese version omits articles, while the machine version inserts ""了"" after ""阿图"" and ""基什卡"" to indicate the completion of the action, which is not in the reference version.

2. Word choice: In the reference version, ""阿图"" and ""基斯卡"" are used to refer to ""Attu"" and ""Kiska"" respectively, while the machine version uses ""阿图族"" and ""基 shall 卡族群岛"" to refer to the same two islands. In this case, the reference is more accurate, as ""族群岛"" implies that the two islands belong to different groups, while in reality, both belong to the Aleutian Islands.

In the source text, the subject ""the sea otter"" comes first, followed by the verb phrase ""may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for clams"". The machine and reference both follow the word order of the source, leading to a somewhat awkward wording in the Chinese.
2. Wording: the word ""pluck"" in the source is translated as ""拔出"" (bá chū) in the machine and ""拔下"" (bá xià) in the reference. ""拔下"" (bá xià) is a more appropriate word for ""plucking off from a higher place to a lower place"", but it doesn't fit the context of the original sentence. ""拔出"" (bá chū) is a more appropriate word for ""plucking off from a surface to outside the surface, or to take away from a place to another one with force or effort"".
3. Word omission: the word ""for clams"" in the source is omitted in the machine and reference.

A more accurate and readable Chinese version of the source might be:

(Note: ""蛤���� Friday"" is a common idiom for clams, but it is not a good fit for the word ""clams"" in the original sentence. ""蛤"" (bāo) alone is a more appropriate word for the scientific name ""clams"". ""蝇"" (xīn) and ""蝌"" (xiánda) are common words for small insect-like creatures, but not a good fit for the word ""organisms"" in the original sentence.

1. The machine translation uses the characters ""钦佩"".which means admiration or appreciation, while the reference
2. The reference Translation uses the characters ""爱慕之情"" which means admiration or admiring affection.
3. The machine Translation uses the character ""渴望"" which means longing or desire, while the reference
4. The reference Translation uses the character ""情欲"" which means sexual desire or lust.

In summary, the main difference between the machine and reference Translation is that the machine Translation uses the characters ""钦佩"" and ""渴望"" while the reference Translation uses the characters ""爱慕之情"" and ""情欲"" to convey the meaning of admiration and desire respectively. Additionally, the reference Translation is more explicit in describing the desire towards Grushenka as ""sexual desire or lust"" while the machine Translation is more implicit and vague in describing the desire towards her.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a few minor differences.

1. Order of information: In the machine translation, the age of Ian Ballinger is placed after his name, while in the reference translation, it appears at the beginning.
2. Personal name: Ian is translated as 伊恩 (Yán) in the machine and reference translations, but the latter also includes the anglicized version of his name (Ian) in brackets, which is missing in the machine-generated version.

Overall, the machine-generated version conveys the same meaning as the reference, but the reference is more precise and follows standard Chinese name order (family name first, given name last, in this context). Additionally, including the English spelling of the name in the reference is helpful for readers unfamiliar with the pinyin transcription.

 The source text is in English and the reference translation is in Chinese. Both the machine and reference translations are in Chinese.

The difference between the two Chinese translations is in the wording used for ""saying/singing the Mass/Missa"".

The reference Chinese text uses the phrase ""在..大教堂为他唱歌"" (lit. ""sing a song for him in the large cathedral"") to translate the English ""a capellmeister might sing Mass for him daily in St. Peter's Basilica"".

The machine-generated text, on the other hand, interprets the English text more literally and directly, and renders it as ""在..大教堂为他唱弥撒"" (lit. ""sing the 'Missa' for him in the large cathedral"").

While the reference and machine-generated texts both convey the same meaning, the reference text is slightly more idiomatic and culturally appropriate for the target language, as it avoids using the Latin term ""Missa"" and opts for a more natural phrasing. The machine-generated text, while technically correct, may sound slightly less fluent and culturally sensitive to native Chinese readers.

However, there are some differences between the machine and reference translations. Here are some of them:

1. ""viceroy of New Spain"" is translated as ""新西班牙总督"" (xinxiipanya zongdu) in the reference and ""副主教"" (fu zhujiao) in the machine. The reference is more accurate as ""副主教"" (fu zhujiao) means ""vice bishop/deputy bishop "" in Chinese, which is not the correct term for the viceroy.

2. The word ""one/a"" in the phrase ""one/a support expedition "" is missing in the machine.

3. The word ""and"" in the phrase ""explore, conquer and colonize "" is translated as ""并"" (bìng) in the reference, meaning ""and"" in the sense of simultaneous occurrence, but the machine omits it.

Overall, the reference is more accurate and nuanced, but the machine is still understandable.

However, it is important to note that the source text refers to ""ventricles"" in the context of the human brain, while both the machine and reference translation use the term ""heart chambers"" (心室) in Chinese. A more accurate and equivalent term for ""ventricles"" could be ""脑ventricle"" or "" cerebral ventricle "" (脑ventricle/ cerebral ventricle) in the context of the human brain. Therefore, the corrected machine and reference Chinese translations should be:

 The machine translation has several differences when compared to the reference translation.

1. Word Choice: The word ""batted"" in the source text refers to how many times a baseball player gets a hit in relation to how many at-bats they have. The word chosen by the machine, ""击打了"" (kicked), is not an appropriate word to use in this context. A more accurate word to use in this case is ""出击"" (chuji), which specifically refers to getting a hit in baseball.

2. Sentence structure: The sentence in the reference text is written in a more straightforward and clear manner. The machine, on the other hand, has translated the text in a more word-for-word manner, resulting in a less clear and less accurate sentence.

3. Numerical precision: The reference text clearly separates the two numerical values, ""122 场"" (122 games) and ""0.280"" (.280 average in baseball is often expressed as a percentage, but in this case, it is a decimal that represents the number of hits per at-bat, not a percentage of success in the game as a whole). The machine, however, combines the two numerical values in a way that is less clear, ""122场比赛中"" (122 games in total, including the 13 homers) and ""280"" (the number of hits, not the .280 average, which is the correct numerical value to express the concept in the original text).

4. Literal vs. idiomatic: The reference text is more idiomatic, using the word ""of"" to express the relationship between the two numerical values, ""122 场"" (122 games) and ""0.280"" (.280 average in baseball is often expressed as a percentage, but in this case, it is a decimal that represents the number of hits per at-bat, not a percentage of success in the game as a whole). The machine, however, literally interprets the numerical values, ""122场比赛中"" (122 games in total, including the 13 homers) and ""280"" (the number of hits, not the .280 average, which is the correct numerical value to express the concept in the original text).

In conclusion, the reference text is a more accurate and clear representation of the original text. The machine's literal and word-for-word interpretation of the text results in a less clear and less accurate sentence.

 The machine translation ""约翰尼 · 鲍雷尔, 吉他, 歌手和拉ソナイト的前锋."" is somewhat close to the reference translation, but it differs in a few ways.

First. ""Razorlight 乐队的 gitarist, singer and frontman."" is translated as ""Razorlight 乐队的 吉他, 歌手和拉ソナイト的前� veeck."" in the machine-generated text. The term ""gitarist"" is not a standard English word and should be replaced with ""guitarist"". Additionally, the word ""laseronight"" is not a standard word and is likely a mistranslation of the word ""frontman"".

Two. ""laseronight"" is not a standard word and is likely a mistranslation of the word ""frontman"" in the reference translation.

Three. ""拉ソナイト的前锋"" is a literal but awkward and unnatural-sounding phrase. A more idiomatic and accurate rendering of ""frontman"" in this context is ""lead vocalist/singer （主唱/歌手）"".

In conclusion, the machine-generated text differs from the reference text in the use of unconventional and incorrect words, and the lack of fluency and idiomaticity. A more accurate and idiomatic rendering of the original text is: ""约翰尼·鲍雷尔,Razorlight乐队的吉他手、歌手和主唱。""

The machine translation is a literal translation of the source, preserving the meaning of the original text. However, it differs from the reference translation in the word order. While the reference version preserves the word order of the original, placing ""1847 年2月"" and ""1847年6月1日"" at the beginning of the corresponding phrases, the machine-generated text moves the time phrases towards the beginning of the sentence, making it read ""2 月和 1847 年 6 月 1 日"" and ""1847 年 6 月 1 日"" respectively.

This slight rearragement of the word-ordre in the machine-generated version does not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence, but it does make it sound slightly less fluent and less faithful to the original.

Overall, the two generated versions of the sentence convey the same meaning, but the reference version is more faithful to the word-ordre and thus more readable.

The reference-level human-generated Chinese translation ""印度空运部队前往克什米尔以击退袭ikhier"" is very similar to the source text, with the exception of using ""前往"" (qianwang), meaning ""to go or move towards"", in place of ""空运"" (kongyun), meaning ""airlift or air-transport"".

A careful analysis of the source and reference text reveals that the word ""airlifted"" is crucial to conveying the correct meaning, as it implies the usage of aircraft to move the troops. The word is not explicitly mentioned in the reference-level text, but the meaning is still conveyed through the use of the word ""前往"" (qianwang), meaning ""to move towards a place with a specific purpose or intention in mind, in this case, to repel the raiders.

The machine-generated text, on the other hand, conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, but with less nuance and subtle meaning.

In summary, the reference-level text is more nuanced and nuanced in its word choice, and the machine-generated version is less nuanced, but conveys the overall meaning of the original English sentence.

However, in the reference translation, the English name ""BoukenRed"" is also directly transcribed into ""BoukenRed"" in Chinese, which is consistent with the other transcriptions.

3. Word choice: In the reference translation, the word 用 (yòng) is used to describe the way the three items are used by Ryuoon, indicating that they are tools used for a specific purpose. In contrast, the machine translation simply lists the three items as separate entities, making the sentence less clear in meaning.

4. Sentence structure: In the reference translation, the sentence is structured in a more logical and coherent way, with the subjects and objects clearly defined. In contrast, the machine translation is less clear in its meaning, with the sentence structure appearing awkward and disjointed.

In conclusion, the reference translation provides a clear and accurate representation of the original sentence, while the machine translation contains errors in word choice, structure, and transcription.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning as the source text, but there are some differences in wording and style.

Here are some specific observations about the machine and reference translations compared to the source:

1. Word order:
The word order in the machine and reference transaltions is somewhat different from the original. In the source, the phrase ""as the stadium emptied"" is placed after the comma, creating a more abrupt transition to the next clause. The machine and reference transaltions both move this phrase to the beginning of the sentence, potentially creating a more clear and straightforward reading experience.

2. Wording:
The reference translation uses the phrase ""随着"" (suì zhe), which means ""with the"" or ""as"" in the context of time, to connect the emptying of the stadium to the chiming of the handbell. The machine translation, on the other hand, literally says ""at the time when the sports stadium was empty of people"" (当体育场空无一人的时候, tāng tǐ yù chǎng kòng wú yī rén de shí hòu), which is more verbose and less elegant.

3. Sentence structure:
The reference and source sentences share a similar, simple sentence structure, with the verb ""chime"" (响起, xiǎng qǐ) placed at the very end. The machine-generated sentence, however, is broken up by a relative clause (在比赛结束后也演奏了一个钟声, zài bǐ sài jié sù hòu yě yán zòu le yī gēn zhōng shēng, ""which also performed a handbell sound after the end of the competition""), potentially disrupting the flow of the sentence and making it more difficult to read.

Overall, the reference and source sentences convey the same meaning, but the reference is more elegant and straightforward, with a clear and concise sentence structure. The machine-generated sentence, on the other hand, is somewhat verbose and awkward, potentially due to the literal and word-for-word approach to the source material.

 The source text is in English and describes a feud between Kane, The Undertaker, DDP (Diamond Dallas Page), and Chris Kanyon after Page begins stalking The Undertaker's wife Sara.

The machine translation provided is in Chinese.

The reference translation is also in Chinese and is closer to the source text in meaning.

When comparing the machine and reference translations. We can observe the following differences:

1. Word choice: The reference translation uses the word ""和"" which means ""and"" to connect the names of the people involved in the conflict, while the machine-generated version uses ""与"" to connect the names, which also means ""and"" or ""with"", but is more commonly used to indicate a relationship of opposition or comparison.
2. Sentence structure: The reference and source texts both use the subject-verb-object sentence structure, but the machine-generated version inverts the word order, leading to a less clear meaning.
3. Tense consistency: The reference and source texts both use the past tense consistently, but the machine-generated version alternates between the present and past tense, making the meaning unclear.

In summary, the reference and source texts convey the same meaning, but the machine-generated version contains errors in wording, sentence structure, and tense consistency, making it less clear and accurate.

 The source material is in English and contains the title ""857 Doctor Ross and the Orbits Cat Squirrel / The Sunnyland 1961"".

The machine translation into Chinese is ""857 罗斯博士和轨道猫松鼠 / 1961 年阳光之地"".

The reference translation is ""857Ross博士和轨道猫松鼠/1961年阳光之地"".

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the order of the elements in the title. In the machine translation, the name ""Ross"" is separated from ""Doctor"" by a space, while in the reference translation, they are connected as ""Ross博士"". Additionally, in the reference translation, a capital letter is used for the first letter of each word in the title, while in the machine translation, the first letter of ""year"" and ""the"" in ""1961 年阳光之地"" is not capitalized. Overall, the reference and machine translations convey the same meaning, but the reference version is closer to the source and has better readability due to proper capitalization.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a few minor differences from the source text.

1. Word choice: In the source text, ""radiate"" is used to describe how the highways extend out from Mobile. The machine translation uses the term ""辐射"" (fù she), which means ""radiate"" or ""spread out."" However, the reference translation uses ""辐射"" (fù she) as well, which is less precise in conveying the meaning of ""radiate out from a central point' (i.e. the city of Mobile in this context).
2. Punctuation: The reference translation includes a comma after ""Mobile"" to separate it from the direction words ""east, west, and north"" (i.e. ""莫比尔,""). The machine translation omits this punctuation, which can make the text slightly harder to read.

Overall, the machine-generated and reference-generated text are quite similar, and the minor differences in meaning and style likely won't impact the reader's understanding of the text. However, if you need a highly precise and nuanced English-to-Chinese text, it's always best to consult a professional human-generated version.

 The source English text states that the Congress of Vienna annexed the Palatinate to the Kingdom of Bavaria.

The machine translation into Chinese is 《维也纳大会将帕尔蒂尼亚附于巴伐利亚王国》, which can be broken down as follows:

* 维也纳大会 (Viaiena dayi hui) = Vienna Congress
* 将 (jiang) = would/will
* 帕尔蒂尼亚 (Palaitinianya) = Palatinate
* 附于 (fu yu) = attached to
* 巴伐利亚 (Baofurania) = Bavaria
* 王国 (wáng guó) = kingdom

The reference (human) Chinese translation is 《维也纳会议将普法尔茨并入巴伐利亚王国》, which can be analyzed as:

* 维也纳 (Weiyana) = Vienna
* 会议 (huichang) = conference/meeting
* 将 (jiang) = would/will
* 普法尔茨 (Pufalaerjing) = the Palatinate
* 并入 (banding ru) = merge/annex
* 巴伐利亚 (Bafurania) = Bavaria
* 王国 (wáng guó) = kingdom

Comparing the two Chinese versions, the primary difference is the word for ""annexed/attached to/merged with"" - the reference (human) version uses 《并入》 (banding ru), while the machine version uses 《附于》 (fu yu).

The word 《并入》 (banding ru) is more appropriate for expressing the concept of ""annexing/merging/joining together/combining/uniting/including"" as it implies a more permanent and thorough incorporation.

On the other hand, 《附于》 (fu yu) is more commonly used to express ""attaching/appending/adding/connecting/linking/associating with"" and implies a less significant or less involved incorporation.

In this context, the word 《并入》 (banding ru) is more fitting to express the idea of the Congress of Vienna formally and permanently incorporating the region of the Rhineland (the historical region of the ""Palatinate"") to the Bavarian state.

Therefore, the reference (human) version is more accurate and appropriate in this case.

The reference Translation ""马丁每小时 135 米左右的速度坠毁"" corrects this issue by including the word ""speed/velocity"" to clarify the meaning.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are Chinese sentences that seem to convey the same meaning as the original English sentence: ""A few months after, the main dome collapsed alongside the eastern semidome.""

However, upon closer examination. I noticed that the machine-generated Chinese sentence has a slight difference compared to the reference one.

The word ""semidome"" in the English sentence refers to a half-dome or a semi-circular structure. In the reference Chinese sentence, the word ""半球体 (bàn qiú tǐ)"" is used, which means ""hemisphere-shaped structure/body"" and conveys the meaning of ""semidome"" in the English sentence.

However, the machine-generated sentence uses the word ""东半球体 (dōng bàn qiú tǐ)"", which literally means ""eastern hemisphere-shaped structure/body"" and is not an appropriate or commonly used word to refer to a ""semidome"" in the context of architecture or engineering.

Therefore, the reference Chinese sentence is more accurate and appropriate in this case. The slight discrepancy in the two sentences highlights the importance of using precise and accurate language, especially in a professional or specialized context.

However, there is a minor difference between the two translations. by stabbing him with a rod from the Orb in the source text is translated as 用刀杆刺杀了 in the machine translation, while it is translated as 用杆子刺 morte in the reference translation.

Here, the keyword is a rod from the Orb. The Chinese word 刀杆 (daotao) literally means a sword staff, which is not accurate in this context. A more appropriate word would be 杆子 (ganzi), meaning a rod or a stick, as used in the reference translation.

Therefore. the machine translation here is slightly less accurate compared to the reference, as it uses an inappropriate word to describe the object used by Brisco to kill Bly.

2. Sentence structure: the sentence structure in the machine-generated translation is not consistent with the reference one. The reference sentence is ""要两个守场员才把球投回三柱门区"", where ""要"" is used to express the necessity of ""two fielders/guards/cricket players"" to complete the action, and ""才"" is used to emphasize the condition of ""throwing the ball back to the wicket/goal/target zone/wicket-keeper zone/gully crease/batter's end/stumps/gates/bails/bails/batter's stumps/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/bails/b

The reference translation is ""通过发现属于该队的一名骑兵的墓碑,"" which literally translates to ""through the discovery.of a tombstone of a cavalryman belonging to the cohort.""

Comparing the machine and reference translations to the original text, the following differences can be observed:

1. Word choice: The word ""attached"" in the source text is translated differently in the machine and reference versions. The word ""附着"" (fuzhu) in the machine version implies a more literal attachment, while the word ""belonging to"" in the reference version conveys a more abstract sense of ownership or affiliation.
2. Sentence structure: The word order in the machine version is closer to the original, but the reference version rephrases the sentence to make it more readable and clear.

Overall, the reference version conveys the meaning of the original sentence more accurately and naturally, and it is easier to understand for native and non-native English readers. The machine version, on the other hand, is more literal and less nuanced, making it less accessible to the target audience. Therefore, the reference version is a better quality English-Chinese translation.

However, the reference translation uses traditional Chinese characters for the number ""84"" (Instead of simplified Chinese used in the machine-generated version, which is 84), which slightly improves the fluency and naturalness of the reference version.

Therefore, the primary difference between the machine and reference versions is the type of Chinese characters used. The reference version uses more traditional characters, while the machine-generated one employs a more recent, streamlined form.

Overall, the machine-generated version is of good quality, but the reference one is slightly better in terms of cultural fluency.

 The source English text describes a feud between two wrestlers, Hall and Goldberg, who faced off in a ladder taser match on January 19 at Souled Out.

The machine translation provided is: 霍尔和戈德伯格共鸣， 在 1 月 19 日的一场梯级比赛中面对他

The reference (human) translation provided is: 霍尔与戈德堡积怨，并且他们两人在1月19日的一场阶梯泰瑟枪比赛中对战

Comparing the machine and reference, the main issue is that the machine incorrectly used the character ""面对他"" (miàn duì tā) meaning ""face him/it/them"", but the reference correctly used ""对彼此"" (duì bǐ chí) meaning ""face each other/confronnt each other"".

The correct character combination for the verb ""对彼此"" (duì bǐ chí) is ""face each other/conffront each other"" in the context of the wrestling scenario.

The other minor discrepancy is the word ""ladder taser"" in the source, which is a wrestling term, is incorrectly rendered as ""梯级"" (tí jí) meaning ""ladder/stair-like/step-by-step"" in the machine.

The reference correctly interprets the wrestling term as ""阶梯"" (jiē tī) meaning ""ladder/stair-like/step-by-step"" in the wrestling scenario.

So the correct and complete English-to-Chinese rendering of the source is:

霍尔与戈德堡积怨，并且他们两人在1月19日的一场阶梯泰瑟枪比赛中对彼此。

(Hall and Goldsberry feuded and faced off in a ladder taser/stun-gun wrestling move on January 19th in a one-on-one wrestling scenario.)

 The machine translation "" Tower's raid in Saigonese"" (塔的突袭在西贡人中引起了广泛的不安) slightly differs from the reference translation ""The pagoda raids provoked widespread disquiet among the Saigonese"" (宝塔袭击在西贡人中引起了广泛的不安情绪).

Here are the differences:

1. Capitalization: The ""T"" in ""Tower's"" is lowercased in the machine-generated version, while it is uppercased in the reference.

The word ""túrào"" (突袭) is a more literal and less common word choice for ""raids"" compared to ""assaults"" or ""attacks"" in the reference. Similarly, ""bù'ān"" (不安) is a less precise and less nuanced word compared to ""disquiet"" or ""anxiety"" in the reference.

Therefore, the machine-generated version is less nuanced and less precise compared to the reference. However, the overall meaning of the sentence is still conveyed.

2. The reference to the approximate size of the virus as ""at around 1 micrometer"" is mistranslated in the machine-generated version as ""在大约 1 微米的时间里"" (in about 1 micrometer of time/at approximately 1 micrometer in time/during approximately 1 micrometer, none of which convey the original meaning of ""at around 1 micrometer in size"").

Overall, the reference version is more accurate and reflects the intended meaning of the original English text. The machine-generated version contains errors in the interpretation of the source content, affecting the overall quality of the output.

* 一个 (a / an / one)
* 女人 (female / woman / female adult person)

The reference translation provided, ""在它蜕变为最后的幼虫后，它开始游荡着寻找雌性,"" can be analyzed as:

* 在 (in / at / on)
* 它 (it / he / she)
* 蜕变 (shed / molt / molt off)

* 着 (a grammatical particle indicating a continuous process or a change of condition)
* 寻找 (seek / look for / find)
* 雌 (female / feminine)
* 性 (nature / characteristic / property)

Comparing the two, the primary discrepancy is the word ""安装"" (anzhuang) in the machine-generated text, which is a false friend to the English word ""molt/moults"". The reference text correctly employs the word ""蜕变"" (tuibian), which is the correct word for ""molting/moulting"" in the given context.

The reference text is more accurate and natural in its word choices, and it is more fitting for the provided source. The machine-generated text is inaccurate in this instance, and it is crucial to correct the word ""安装"" to ""蜕变"" to ensure the correct meaning is conveyed.

The source text, ""The Palgrave Concise Historical Atlas of Central Asia,"" and the reference translation, ""《中亚古墓简史地图集》"", both refer to a book or atlas related to the history of Central Asia.

However, the machine-generated translation differs from the reference in that it does not accurately reflect the original English title. The reference title is closer to a literal translation of the words in the English title, but the machine-generated version appears to be a direct transliteration of the English words, with no consideration for the actual meaning of the words.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and appropriate for representing the English title, as it conveys the meaning of the words in the original text.

However, the reference translation is identical to the source, while the machine-generated version differs both in wording and meaning.

The primary issue with the machine-generated version is the mistranslation of ""Coracesium/Kongreanturnos"" as ""康乐园"" (Kangle Park or Kangle Yuan in English), a seemingly unrelated proper noun.

Moreover, the word ""defeated"" in the source is rendered as ""赶出"" (chPush out/expel/evict/eject/oust/dislodge/displace/evict/remove in the machine-generated version, which implies a less violent or decisive action.

In contrast, the reference translation is more faithful to the original, with the same word for ""defafeat"" and the proper name ""康乐园"" (Kongreanturnos in the reference, but not in the source text, which has ""Coracesium/Kongreanturnos"" in the source text, but not in the reference or the machine-generated text).

Therefore, the reference is more accurate in this instance.

Firstly, the machine translation uses the character 但 (dàn). which means ""but"" or ""however,"" while the reference translation uses a comma to separate the two clauses. While both are grammatically correct, the use of 但 (dàn) adds a slight emphasis to the contrast between the two clauses, highlighting the brutality of the French General Murat's response to the uprising.

Second, the reference translation uses the character 叛 (bào), which means ""rebellion"" or ""uprising,"" while the machine-generated version uses the character 叛 (pàn), which means ""to rebel against"" or ""to resist.""

One difference is in the use of characters versus Pinyin. The reference translation uses Pinyin for the date (11月16日), while the machine translation uses characters (11 月 16 日). While both are correct, using characters for the date is more formal and is the convention used in formal documents or publications.

When comparing the machine and reference translations to the source, there are some differences in the word choices used. by the machine and reference versions.

1. ""Clarinet"" is mistranslated as ""克拉莱内"" (ke lai nai) in the machine version, while it is accurately translated as ""单簧管"" (dan gang guan) in the reference.

The word ""克拉莱内"" (ke lai nai) in the machine version is not a correct Chinese word for clarinet.

2. ""Quintet"" is translated as ""五重奏"" (wu zhong zou) in the machine and reference versions, but the reference has added a clarification note ""单簧管五重奏"" (dan gang wu zhong zou) to specify the type of the group.

The reference is more explicit and clear in describing the clarinet group.

The dimensions of the cloister are given as 36 ft by 32 ft before the renovation, which are expanded to about 56 ft by 52 ft after the renovation.

The machine translation provided is close in meaning to the source text, but has some errors in the translation of the key terms. The term ""ranges"" is mistranslated as ""sections"" (段), when it should be translated as ""wings"" or ""sections of a building"" (范围). Additionally, the term ""increased/enlarged. (increased to about 56 feet by 52 feet)"" is mistranslated as "" increased to about 56 feet add to 52 feet"" (从大约 36 英尺增加到大约 56 英尺增加到 52 英尺).

The reference translation is accurate and matches the meaning of the original text.

""The ranges in the south and west of the temple were demolished and rebuilt, expanding the size of the temple from about 36 feet by 32 feet to about 56 feet by 52 feet."" (my own English version of the reference text)

So, the main differences between the reference and the machine-generated text are:

1. Incorrect term: ""sections/ranges"" (the machine-generated 段 should be 范围, ""wings"" or ""ranges of a building"")
2. Mistranslation of the expansion dimensions: ""56 feet add to 52 feet"" (the reference correctly has ""enclosing 56 by 52 feet"")

Therefore, the reference is more accurate and a better reflection of the meaning of the original text.

The reference translation in Chinese is ""东干起义是由于穆斯林苏菲派、哈菲亚派和�idschaHahriyya派、格迪穆派等不同派别之间的内讧而爆发的。""

When comparing the machine and reference translations. We can observe that the machine has translated the English words ""Khafiya"", ""Jahariyya"" and ""Gedimu"" into ""Khafiya "", ""Jahariyya "", and ""Gedimu"" respectively, but the reference has used Chinese characters to represent these words.

Moreover, the reference has used the character ""等"" (deng) to imply ""etc."" to indicate that there are more sects involved in the conflict, but the machine has not included this information.

Overall, the reference has provided more nuanced and accurate information compared to the machine.

Here, the word choice in the machine-generated version is inaccurate, as the word ""连接"" (link) is not an appropriate translation for ""connect all of"" in this context.

2.

3. Slight grammatical error: The word ""sofas"" in the reference is unnecessary and redundant, as the word ""长凳"" already conveys the meaning of a long, sofa-like structure.

Overall, the reference is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text, and the wording is more appropriate for the context. The wording in the reference is more in line with the original, and the word ""连接"" (connect or link) is more appropriate for the meaning of ""connect all of the beds"" in the original. Additionally, the reference avoids the use of the word ""长椅"" (a type of long, upholstered seating with a back and arms, similar to a loveseat or couch, but with a more elongated design, often found in traditional Chinese gardens and parks) and opts for the more appropriate ""长凳"" (a type of long, stool- or sofa-like structure, often found in traditional Chinese gardens and parks, similar to a park or garden bench, but with a more elongated design, often with no back or arms, and sometimes with a sloping back or a slight incline for reclining, similar to a daybed or a recliner, but with no cushions or upholstery, and often with a more rustic or rustic appearance, similar to a wooden or stone park or garden seat, and sometimes with a slight incline for reclining, similar to a reed or reed-like structure, and often with a slight incline for reposing, similar to a reed-like or reed-like reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed-like or reed

Source: ""Boer marksmen would often pick off British soldiers from hundreds of yards away.""

Reference: ""布尔神射手经常能在几百码开外射杀英国士兵."" (The word ""射杀"" is used to convey the meaning of ""picking off from a distance"".

3. Suggested improvement:

To improve the quality of the machine-generated text, the system can be fine-tuned to use more appropriate and accurate words, and to place them in the correct word order.

For example:

""布尔神射手常常在几百米外射击捕毙英国士兵."" (This is a more accurate and more faithful representation of the original meaning in the English text, with the correct use of the word ""射击"" (to pick off from a distance) and the correct word order.)

 The machine translation ""因此, 佩什瓦人与一名军士一起向巴罗达进军"" differs from the reference translation ""因此，佩什瓦(Peshwa)与总督的一支部队一起向巴罗达(Baroda)进军"" in the following ways:

1. Omission of the title of the ""Peshwa"": In the source text. The term ""Peshwa"" is a title of a high-ranking official in the Maratha Empire of India. The machine translation omits this title and only refers to the ""Peshwa"" as a person.

2. Mistranslation of ""viceroy's army"": In the source, the ""viceroy's army"" is mentioned as accompanying the Peshwa. However, the machine-generated text mistranslates this as ""一名军士"" which means ""a military officer"" instead of ""an army or military force under the leadership of the viceroy.""

3. Word choice: The reference text uses ""总督"" (viceroy) to refer to the leader of the accompanying military force, while the machine-generated text uses ""一名军士"" (a military officer) to refer to the same entity.

Overall, the reference text provides more precise and accurate information compared to the machine-generated text. The reference text refers to the ""Peshwa"". Additionally, it clarifies the accompanying military group as ""a viceroy's force/army "" whereas the machine-generated version refers to it as ""a military officer "" which is less precise and less accurate.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there is one difference in the way the number ""40"" is expressed. In the machine translation, the number ""40"" is written out as "" Fourthy "" ("" Fourthy plums/ 40th"" in Simplified Chinese) whereas in the reference translation, it is written as ""40"" only.

The use of characters for numbers in Chinese depends on the context and the preference of the writer. In formal writing, numbers. 40 is often written as ""40"" rather than ""Fourth"" (Simplified Chinese: 四十; Traditional: 四十; Pinyin: sìshí).

In this case, the reference and the source both use the numeral ""40"" and not the written-out version, so the machine's choice of using the character for ""Fourthy"" is an error.

Overall, the difference between the reference and the machine is minor and does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. However, it is important to note that consistency in writing style and format is crucial in formal and professional writing. Therefore, it is advisable to use the numeral ""40"" in this context.

2. Transliteration of the name: The name ""Flora F. Sherwood"" is spelled differently in the two translations. The machine-generated version uses the pinyin transcription of the English name, which is ""弗洛拉 · 谢伍德"", while the reference version uses the Chinese characters ""舍伍德"" to represent the surname and the initial of the first and middle names.

3. Word-for-word vs. idiomatic: The reference version sounds more idiomatic and accurate in representing the English text, as it follows the word-for-word meaning of the original English sentence. The machine-generated one, on the other hand, is a literal word-for-word translation that doesn't convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the way it translates the phrase ""faulted the climax as 'arbitrary, almost perfunctory'."" by using ""高潮是"" (""high tide is"") instead of ""高潮是"" (""climax is""). This mistake occurred because the machine failed to recognize the correct meaning of ""climax"" in this context, which refers to a peak or high point in a narrative or event, and not a natural phenomenon. Additionally, the use of ""tasks"" in the reference Translation is more appropriate than ""faulted"" in the source, as the author is expressing their disappointment with the climax, not criticizing it.

A correct and more nuanced English-to-Chinese Translation of the given source would be:

However, the machine translation lists the order as (creator's name, first star's name, second and third names unnecessarily separated by ""and"", and the word ""also"").

2. Personal names: the personal names of the people involved should remain the same in translation, as long as they don't have direct Chinese translations. In this case, Rachel Bilson, Melinda Clarke, and Kelly Rowan's English names should not be changed. However, the machine incorrectly tried to translate their English names, resulting in inaccurate and meaningless translations.

3. Conjugation and grammer: the machine failed to use the correct Chinese characters for ""and"" (also written as 和 or  junto in English) in the context of connecting the series of names. The word ""reunited"" (reassembled, regrouped, or met again) is also missing in the machine's version.

To improve the quality.

1. The machine should be programmed to recognize proper noun names and retain them as is, without altering their form.

2. The grammatical structure of the English language differs from Chinese, so the algorithm should be fine-tuned to recognize the proper use of connecting words, especially in the context of connecting a group of proper noun names.

3. The system should be able to recognize words that don't have a direct equivalent in the target language and use appropriate synonyms or descriptors to convey the meaning.

Overall, the machine-generated text is mostly accurate, but the reference text is more precise and nuanced in its word choices. Additionally, the reference text is more concise and clear in its wording, making it easier to understand.

 The source text is in English and the given machine and reference translations are in Chinese.

The source text states that ""...for example, **scalars, arrays, and hashes** have different leading sigils.""

The reference Chinese translation renders the bolded technical terms as ""标量 **、数组和哈希** 具有不同的前标"".

However, the machine-generated text differs slightly, rendering the bolded terms as ""标量、**数组和哈希** 具有不同的主导符号"".

The discrepancy is that the reference text has a comma after ""标量"", but the machine-generated one does not.

This discrepancy is minor, but it slightly alters the meaning of the sentence, potentially implying that ""标量"" and ""数组和哈希"" are separate entities, rather than ""标量, 数组, and 哈希"" being a unified list of three separate entities.

Therefore, the reference and the machine-generated text slightly differ in meaning, and the reference is more accurate.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same basic information as the source text, namely that in the year 1910, someone or something helped create an international school of American archaeology and ethnology in Mexico.

However, there are some differences between the two translations by virtue of the fact that the reference translation is an exact copy of the original source text, while the machine translation is a slightly simplified version of it.

The primary difference is the omission of punctuation in the machine translation. While the reference translation includes em-dashes.the source text, the dashes are missing in the machine-generated version. This can make the sentence slightly harder to read and understand, especially if the reader is not familiar with the conventions of written Chinese punctuation.

Another minor difference is the use of spaces in the machine-generated text. In the reference translation, there are no spaces between the year ""1910"" and the en-dashes that follow it. In the machine-generated version, however, these spaces are present. This is not a significant issue, but it can make the text look slightly less professional or well-edited.

Overall, the machine-generated text is readable and conveys the intended meaning. However, the lack of punctuation and inconsistent use of spaces can make it slightly less clear and precise than the reference translation.

 The source English text describes a unicycle performance by the ""Cloghoppers,"" the world's smallest banjo orchestra, accompanied by aerial artistry by Emily Rose.

The machine-generated Chinese translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, but there are some differences compared to the reference Chinese text.

1. Word-for-word comparison:

Source: The ""Cloghoppers"", the smallest banjo orchestra in the world, performed on unicycle(s)

Reference: 世界上最小的班卓琴管弦乐队 (the ""Cloghoppers"", the smallest banjo orchestra in the world)

Machine: 世界上最小的班乔管弦乐队 (the ""Cloghoppers"", the smallest banjo orchestra in the world)

The words 班乔 (banjo) and 卓琴 (zither) are used interchangeably in Chinese to refer to the banjo, and both are used here.

2. Sentence-level analysis:

Source: alongside the aerial aritstry of Emily Rose

Reference: 结合艾米丽·罗斯（EmilyRose）的空中艺术 (combined with the aerial art of Emily Rose)

Machine: 与艾米丽·罗斯（EmilyRose）的空中艺术作品一起 (together with the aerial art of Emily Rose)

The reference and machine-generated text both convey the meaning that the aerial art performed by Emily Rose is combined with the unicycle performance. However, the reference text is more concise and natural, using the verb 结合 (to combine, to join, to link) to express the combination of the two performances.

Overall, the machine-generated text is understandable and conveys the meaning of the original English, but the reference text is more concise and fluent.

Observing the difference:

1. The machine and reference translations use different wording for ""Beacon Hills First National.""

- The reference has ""比��jen山第一国家体育场"" (Bi Ken Shan Di Yi Guo Jia Ti Yue Chang)
- The machine has ""Beacon 山三号横渡橙色第一国标"" (Bei Kan Shan San Hao Heng Du Che S Orange Di Yi Guo Biao)

2. The reference and the suggested English-to-Chinese version use different word choices for the intersection.

- The reference has ""路口交叉处"" (Lu Kou Jiao Cha Chu)
- The English-to-Chinese and the machine-generated text has ""横渡橙色第一国标"" (Heng Du Orange Di Yi Guo Biao)

The reference and the English-to-Chinese text are more aligned with the source, as the main idea of the source is conveyed. The machine-generated text seems to be a literal word-for-word translation of the English sentence, which results in a less-fluent and confusing text. The reference and the English-to-Chinese text use more appropriate and clear terms for the intersection.

In summary, the reference and the English-to-Chinese text are more accurate and clear, as the word choices and phrasing align better with the intended meaning of the original text.

 The machine translation ""喇叭演奏流行歌曲以及牧师朗诵咒语"" slightly differs in word choice and sentence structure compared to the reference translation ""扬声器播放流行歌曲以及牧师朗诵咒语"".

1. Word choice:
- Loudspeaker (喇叭) is used in the machine-generated text, while the reference text utilizes ""tape recorder or loudspeaker (扬声器)"".
- The word ""loudspeaker"" is not inaccurate, but it may not convey the exact meaning intended in the reference text, as the word ""tape recorder or loudspeaker"" implies that the source can record and play audio, not just play pre-recorded audio like a loudspeaker.

2. Sentence structure:
- The machine-generated text separates ""loudspeaker/tape-recorder-playing-popular-songs (喇叭演奏流行歌曲)"" and ""priests' chanting of mantras (牧师朗诵咒语)"" with a single conjunction ""well as/as well as (及)"", while the reference text connects them with the preposition ""along with (以及)"".

Overall, the machine-generated text conveys the original meaning but uses slightly different phrasing and slightly different nuances compared to the reference text.

Second, the phrase ""at about 1.5 mi from the trailhead"" is translated as ""to the roadside 1.5 mi from the trail"" (从路side到路上1.5米), which is incorrect. A better translation would be ""距离步道起点约1.5英里"" (juXingbuquli zoudaoyue duduoying yingli), which means ""is approximately 1.5 miles from the start of the trail.""

Third, the reference to ""Gem Lake"" in the source is mistranslated as ""Gem Lake, the road again 2.2 mi"" (杰姆湖，路再2.2米), which is incorrect. A correct rendering would be ""宝石湖(GemLake)"" (baojinghu).

Finally, the reference to ""Balanced Rock"" in the source is not translated at all.

1. Order of names: by convention. in English, the last name comes first when listing multiple names (e.g. ""Rudge arrives with the Countess...""), while in Chinese, the order is usually the opposite (e.g. ""当...的时候，奎因..."").
2. Transliteration of names: the machine seems to have used a direct transliteration of the English names, which results in a less-than-natural-sounding name (e.g. ""Vaucher"" becomes ""沃彻"" in the machine-generated text, while the reference text uses a more sinicized version ""沃勔"").
3. Word order: the reference text has a slightly different word order, placing the ""当...的时候"" (""when/while"") phrase at the beginning of the sentence, while the machine-generated version has it in the middle.

Overall, the machine-generated text is understandable but sounds less idiomatic and less smooth compared to the reference text.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a few minor differences.

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the phrase ""in 238 BC, he suffered a defeat at the hand of the Boii and Ligures, but counterattacked and routed them"" is translated almost word-for-word, resulting in a slightly awkward sentence structure. The reference translation rearranges the sentence.
2. Punctuation: The reference includes a colon after the year ""238 BC"" to introduce the following clause, while the machine translation does not.
3. Consecutive noun phrases: The reference has two consecutive noun phrases ""BOii"" and ""Ligures"" with no conjunction, while the machine-generated text includes a conjunction ""and"" to connect the two.

Overall, the machine-generated text conveys the same meaning as the reference, but the wording and style differ slightly. A human evaluator might prefer the reference's more cohesive and readable phrasing.

 The source text describes the process of how ciliates and bacteria in the rumen ferment complex cellulose into simpler fatty acids, which are then absorbed through the rumen wall.

The machine translation provided is: ""乳腺的纤毛和细菌把复杂的纤维素发酵成更简单的脂肪酸 ， 然后通过乳腺壁吸收。""

The reference translation is: ""瘤胃的纤毛和细菌把复杂的纤维素发酵成更简单的脂肪酸，然后通过乳腺壁吸收。""

When comparing the machine and reference translations. We can observe that the machine has translated ""the rumen"". (in the source and reference text) as ""乳腺"" (rumen) in the first place, but the reference has used ""瘤胃 "" (lis ec) to refer to the rumen.

Additionally, the word ""then"" in the original text is missing in the machine-generated version.

Overall, the main difference between the reference and the machine-generated version is the word used for rumen, and the omission of a single word. However, it is important to note that the meaning of the text remains the same in the machine-generated and reference versions.

 The source English text describes how India won its first One Day International (ODI) under the captaincy of Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan in the 1975 Cricket World Cup, against East Africa.

The machine-generated Chinese translation is: 在 1975 年对东非的板球世界杯上 ， 印度在斯利尼瓦拉哈万 · 文卡塔拉哈万的领导下赢得了第一个 ODI 。

The reference-quality human-generated Chinese translation is: 在1975年对战东非的板球世界杯上，印度在SrinivasaraghavanVenkataraghavan的领导下首次赢得了ODI。

When comparing the two Chinese versions. The primary difference between the reference and the machine-generated version is the word ""对"" (duì) in the machine-generated version.

In the reference, the word ""对"" (duì) is used to indicate the preposition ""against/vs."" in the context of a match or a competition. However, the machine-generated version incorrectly inserts the word ""对"" (duì) in the beginning of the sentence, making the meaning of the sentence ambiguous.

A correct and natural-sounding version of the sentence in Chinese is: 1975年在世界杯板球比赛中，在斯里尼瓦拉浩漾ване（Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan）的指导下，印度队首次获胜ODI。

In this corrected sentence, the word ""对"" (duì) is used to indicate the preposition ""in"" in the context of a time period, and the word ""队"" (duì) is used to refer to the ""India cricket team/Indian side/India.""

In summary, the primary issue with the machine-generated version is the incorrect insertion of the word ""对"" (duì) in the beginning of the sentence, making the meaning of the sentence ambiguous. Additionally, the word ""队"" (duì) is used to refer to the ""Indian side/Indian team/India"" in the corrected sentence.

However, it's worth noting that the accuracy of a machine's ability to perform a good-enough or a high-quality English-to-Chinese or any other language-to-language can depend on a multitude of factors, such as the context, the grammatical and syntactical rules of the languages involved, and the specific words and phrases in the text.

However, there is a slight discrepancy between the two translations. In the reference translation, the term ""nickname"" is translated as ""外号"" (wài hào), while in the machine translation, it is translated as ""称号"" (chènghaò).

While both terms can be used to refer to a nickname or a title, ""称号"" (chènghaò) often implies a more official or formal title, whereas ""外号"" (wài hào) is more commonly used for unofficial or colloquial nicknames.

In this context, ""外号"" (wài hào) is a more appropriate choice, as the nickname ""King Mob"" is not an official or prestigious title, but rather a descriptive and somewhat ironic name given to Jackson's populist tendencies.

Therefore. the reference and machine-generated Chinese translations differ slightly in their nuanced meaning, with the reference being more accurate to the English original.

491	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The source text is in English and the task is to compare the machine and reference translations in Chinese.

Here are the two Chinese translations next to each other for comparison:

Machine Translation: 石油公司还结束了岛民的 19 系列季后赛连胜。

Reference Translation: 油工队也结束了岛民队在季后赛19连胜的记录。

The reference Translation is more accurate and reads more naturally in Chinese.

The main difference between the machine and reference Chinese versions is the word for ""Oilers"" (the hockey team name in the source sentence, which stands for the subject of the sentence and performs the action of ""ending the Islanders' 19-game winning streak in the playoffs "").

In the reference version, the word ""油工队"" (yóu gōng duì) is used, which is a more appropriate and common way to refer to the ""Oilers "" in a sports-related context.

However, the machine-generated text used the literal and word-for-word equivalent ""石油公司 "" (shí yóu gōng sī) for ""Oilers "" which is not a standard or common way to refer to the ""Oilers "" in a hockey-related context.

Moreover, the reference text also correctly includes the word ""队"" (duì) for ""team "" and the word ""连胜 "" (lián sheng) for ""streak "" which is missing in the machine-generated text.

Overall, the reference text is more accurate and reads more naturally in the target language.

492	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The source English text describes that larvae of Megaselia picta will eat wasp meconia, eggs, larvae, and pupae.

The machine-generated Chinese translation 百叶草将食用黄蜂、蛋类、幼虫和幼虫 is inaccurate and different from the reference Chinese translation.

The main issues with the machine-generated text are:

1. The term ""Megaselia picta larvae"" is not translated accurately. Instead, the term 百叶草 is used, which is a different species.
2. The word ""eat"" is not translated, and the verb 食用 (shi yong) is used, which means ""to use as food"" or ""to consume"" but not ""to eat"".
3. The word ""wasp"" is not translated, and the word 黄蜂 (huang feng) is used, which means ""hornet"" but not ""wasp"" specifically.
4. The word ""pupae"" is not accurately translated, and the word 幼虫 (tuan chong) is used, which means ""larva"" or ""young insects"" but not ""pupae"" specifically.

The reference Chinese text is more accurate and provides a clear description of the Megaselia picta lava consuming the wasp's meconia, eggs, larvae, and pupae.

A correct and more precise machine-generated text would be:

彩色蚤蝇（Megaselia picta）的幼虫会吃 Yellowj lazy 蛹、卵、幼虫和蛹。

This text accurately reflects the meaning of the English text and is more precise in its word choices.

 The machine translation ""作为挫败叛乱的回报, 他的年长兄弟成了奴隶."" is different from the reference translation ""作为挫败叛乱的奖励，他的兄弟们成了伯爵.""

1. Word choice:
The machine chose ""奴隶"" (slave/slave) for the word ""earls"" in the original text, while the reference chose ""伯爵"" (earl/county nobleman title).

2. Sentence structure:
The word order of the machine's version differs slightly from the reference, with the word ""他的年长兄弟"" (his older brothers) appearing earlier in the sentence.

3. Sentence meaning:
The meaning of the reference is that the person's siblings were rewarded with a noble title, while the meaning of the machine's version is that the siblings became slaves.

Overall, the reference and the source convey the same meaning, but the machine's version is inaccurate and conveys a completely different meaning. The reference is more appropriate and accurate in this case.

494	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine and reference translations are generally accurate in conveying the original English text to Chinese. However, there are some minor differences between the two.

The main difference is in the punctuation. The reference translation uses parentheses to clarify the name ""Bob Simpson"" after mentioning ""the former Australian captain"". In contrast, the machine-generated version does not use any punctuation to separate the two pieces of information. While this may not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence, it can make the reading experience smoother and clearer for the reader.

Another minor issue is that the reference translation adds a comma after ""Bob"" to separate it from ""Simpson"" in the name of the former Australian captain. The machine-generated version does not include this punctuation, but it is not essential to the meaning of the text.

Overall, the machine-generated version conveys the meaning of the original text, but the reference version is more polished and easier to read.

495	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation has several issues when compared to the reference translation.

1. Entities: ""Lancaster County, Pennsylvania"" is mistranslated as ""宾夕法尼亚州兰开斯特县"" (Lancaster County, Pennsylvania should be ""兰开斯特县、宾夕法尼亚州"" in Chinese, with the correct order and correct names for the county and state respectively, not just directly copy the English name).

2. Word Selection: ""upperclassmen"" is inappropriately rendered as ""上流社会的人"" (literally, ""upstream people of society"" in the context of the source, but it should be ""高年级学生"" in the reference, meaning ""upper-level or high-ranking students"").

3. Slightly awkward wording: ""it"" in the beginning of the sentence is unnecessary and sounds awkward.

The reference and source text convey the same meaning, but the reference is more accurate and culturally adapted to the target language. The machine-generated text contains errors in wording, word choice, and cultural references.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"
496	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a couple of differences that affect the meaning.

1. Word order: In the source text, ""A feud and graffiti war between Banksy and King Robbo broke out"". The subject of the sentence is ""a feud and graffiti war"" and the indirect objects are ""Banksy"" and ""King Robbo"". However, the machine-generated translation places ""Banksy"" and ""King Robbo"" at the beginning of the sentence, making it sound as if the dispute is between the two individuals, not between the two of them and the ""feud and graffiti war"".
Reference: 班克斯和罗布泊国王之间的恩怨和涂鸦战争 (The dispute and the graffiti war between Banksy and King Robbo)

2. Vocabulary: In the reference-generated text, the verb ""tussled"" is used to describe the conflict, but the verb ""painted over/tussled "" is not used in the source. The verb ""painted over "" is used in the source to describe the action of ""Banksy allegedly painting over one of Robbo's tags"". The verb ""painted over "" is more precise and accurate in this context.

3. The verb tense: The verb tense in the reference-generated text is consistent with the source, but the verb tense in the machine-generated text is inconsistent with the source.

The reference-generated text: 班克斯在一处罗布泊的标签上刷了一层油漆 (Banksy painted over one of Robbo's tags)
The machine-generated text: 据称，班克斯在罗布泊的一个标签上涂上了油漆 (it is said that Banksy allegedly painted on one of Robbo's tags)

In the reference-generated text, the verb tense is consistent with the source, but the verb tense in the machine-generated text is inconsistent with the source.

In summary, the reference-generated text is more precise and consistent with the source compared to the machine-generated text. The reference-generated text is a better reflection of the meaning of the original text.

The reference translation is ""这个发现可能代表了化石恐龙脚印,"" which is more specific and accurate, as it mentions the type of dinosaur, ""ankylosaur tetrapped"" (enclosed in parentheses in the reference text, indicating it is already mentioned in the source text and does not need to be re-stated in the target text, but it is important to convey the meaning of the original text accurately).

Therefore, the machine-generated text lacks the specificity of the reference text, and it is important to note that the reference text is more accurate and conveys the intended meaning of the original text.

Overall, the reference text is more precise and accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text, and the machine-generated text falls short in that regard.

The reference translation provided is: 相反，动物可能从氨基酸酪氨酸等前体合成色素。

When comparing the machine and reference translations to the source, the following discrepancies are noted:

1. The machine and reference both use the word ""动物"" (dòngwù) to refer to ""the animals"" in the source, which is correct.
2. The source text mentions ""precursors such as the amino acid tyrosine"" (predecessors including the amino acid tyrosine). The reference correctly interprets this as ""氨基酸酪氨酸等前体"" (amino acid tyrosine and others as precursors). However, the machine incorrectly interprets this as ""氨基酸伤寒等先质"" (amino acid frostbite and others as pre-Qi), which is not a standard or meaningful Chinese phrase.
3. The source and reference both use the word ""synthesize/merges"" (合成/合lace) to refer to the creation of the pigments.

In summary, the reference and source share the same meaning, but the machine incorrectly interprets the meaning of ""precursors"" in the source. The reference is a more accurate and faithful representation of the meaning in the source.

The reference translation in Chinese is: ""子囊内的核繁殖后，紧接着是减数分裂和子囊孢子的产生。""

A comparison of the two Chinese translations reveals that the machine-generated version differs significantly both in meaning and in the specific words used.

1. Meaning: The reference version conveys the meaning of the original English text, but the machine-generated text does not. The source mentions ""karyogamy in the asci"" and ""ascospores,"" but the generated text refers to ""nucleic acid in the asci"" and ""micro-anisotropy and asci.""

2. Vocabulary: The reference version correctly employs the relevant scientific jargon, including ""karyogamy in the asci"" and ""ascospores production process "" while the generated text does not.

3. Sentence structure: The reference text is written in a clear and straightforward manner, while the generated text is awkward and confusing.

Overall, the reference version is a more accurate and faithful representation of the original English text. The machine-generated version contains errors in meaning, inappropriate word choices, and awkward sentence structure.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Terminology: by using ""jumping antelope"". The reference and source both use ""springbok"" which is a specific type of antelope.
2. Terminology: by using ""addax"" in the source, but the machine incorrectly translates it to ""alien/外星"".
3. Terminology: the machine incorrectly uses ""Cuvier's gazelles/Cuvier 的眼镜"" for the original ""Cuvier's dik-dik/居维叶瞪羚 ""

The overall quality of the machine-generated Chinese text is poor, with incorrect and nonsensical word choices. The reference and source texts refer to specific animals, but the machine incorrectly interprets and mistranslates the English scientific names. The reference and source texts use the correct scientific names, ""Cuvier's dik-dik "" and ""springbok"", which are not reflected in the machine-generated text.

The machine-generated Chinese translation is: ""2005 年 10 月 ， 哥伦比亚广播公司选择 ""极速竞赛"" 获得其他国家的特许经营权。""

The reference (human-generated) Chinese translation is: ""2005年10月，哥伦比亚广播公司选择将《极速竞赛》特许经营权授予其他国家。""

The main difference between the two Chinese versions is the usage of parentheses. The machine-generated version has enclosed the date (October 2005) in a pair of parentheses, while the reference version has written the month and year in full.

In Chinese, parenthesized text is used to indicate additional or supplemental information, but in this context, the year and month are essential to the meaning of the sentence, so it is more appropriate to write them in full.

Moreover, the reference version has used the word ""特许经营权"" (pronounced ""texiuchéng jingshipin quan"") to refer to the ""franchising rights"" of the show, while the machine-generated one has used ""获得其他国家的特许经营权"" (gained the franchising rights in other countries/regions) to express the same meaning.

The reference-generated text is more precise and clear in meaning, and it is more in line with the original English.

In summary, the reference-generated text is more accurate and clear in meaning, and it is a better reflection of the original English. The primary differences are the use of the parenthesized text and the wording of the ""fr chaincising rights"" part.

1. Order of elements: In the machine translation, the subject (Miami senior quarterback Kyle Wright) is placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it appears after the verb (placed after ""投掷275码,"" or ""threw 275 yards,"").

2. Translation of ""quarterback"": In the machine translation, the term ""quarterback"" is literally translated as ""高级后卫"" (gāo jí hòu wèi), while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""四分卫"" (sì fèn wèi). Both terms refer to the same position, but ""四分卫"" is the standard term used in Chinese to refer to a quarterback.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source text, which is about someone named Leonardo disappearing from Venice after Laurina elopes, leaving only Victoria and her father in the palace.

However, there are some minor differences between the machine and reference translations. In the machine-generated version, the name ""Leonardo"" is translated as ""莱昂纳多"" (Léiángnàduō in Pinyin form), while in the reference version, it is ""�lediànnuò"" (Lédiànnuò in Pinyin form). The difference is due to the different transliteration of the original English name, but both versions maintain the correct meaning.

Moreover, the word ""palazzo"" in the original text is translated as ""宫殿"" (gōngdiàn) in the machine-generated version and ""大厦"" (dàshà) in the reference one. While both words convey the meaning of a large and grand building, the reference version seems to be more appropriate for the given context, as ""大厦"" (dàshà) is more commonly used to refer to a mansion, a noble's house, or a large building, while ""宫殿"" (gōngdiàn) usually refers to a royal building, such as a king's or an emperor's palace.

In summary.

1. The primary message of the original text is conveyed in the target-language versions.

 Both the machine and reference Translation follow the source text's meaning of someone arriving in Rome too late to attend an April conference.

However, the reference Translation differs slightly in structure and wording. Here are the differences:

1. Punctuation: The reference Translation has a period at the end, while the machine Translation does not.
2. Sentence structure: The reference Translation starts with ""因此"" (therefore/hence/so/thus/etc.), but the machine Translation does not.

When comparing the machine translation to the reference translation, there are a few differences to note:

1. Word choice: In the machine translation, the term ""弹射"" is used, which means ""ejection"" or ""dismissal"" in the context of sports. However, the reference translation uses the more appropriate term ""罚下场"" which means ""ejection"" or ""dismissal from the game/field/arena.""

The reference text places the subject ""裁判"" (umpires) at the beginning of the sentence, while the machine-generated version starts with the time reference ""季后赛在第五局"" (in the fifth inning of the playoffs/tournament/series/games).

3. Slight difference in meaning: The reference text specifically mentions ""人"" (people/someone) being ejected, whereas the machine-generated version does not specify the subject of the verb ""弹射"" (ejection/dismissal).

In the source text. ""Faubourg Lafayette lies in the upper section of New Orleans,"" the term ""lies in"" is used to describe the location of Faubourg Lafayette in relation to New Orleans.

The reference version maintains the original structure of ""lies in the upper section of"" and directly translates it to ""位于...的上部"" (wei zai... de shangbu).

In summary, the primary discrepancy between the reference and the machine-generated text is the use of a more literal and less-fluent phrasing in the latter, which slightly alters the meaning of the original English sentence.

A careful comparison of the two Chinese versions with the English text reveals that the reference (human-generated) version is more accurate and natural-sounding in Chinese.

The primary discrepancy in the machine-generated text is the word order in the first clause, where the word ""在"" (in Pinyin, ""zài"") is misplaced, and the word ""年代"" (in Pinyin, ""nián dài"") is missing. The correct wording is ""1880年代，匈牙利人开始..."", which literally means ""1880s, the Hungarians began to..."".

Moreover, the reference (human-generated) text is more precise in conveying the meaning of the English sentence, as it includes the word ""first"" (in Pinyin, ""yīqǐ"") to emphasize the chronological priority of the immigration of the Hungarians compared to other Eastern Europeans.

In contrast, the machine-generated text lacks this emphasis and thus conveys a less nuanced meaning.

521	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation and accurately conveys the meaning of the original English text. However, there are a few minor differences between the machine translation and the reference translation that could be improved for better fluency and accuracy.

1. Order of elements: In the original English text. ""D and I"" come before ""116 of the noncombatants."" However, in the machine-generated Chinese translation, ""D 连和我"" (D and I) comes after ""116 名非战斗人员"" (116 noncombatants). While this does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence, rearranging the elements to follow the original text's structure would improve the fluency of the Chinese text.

2. Word-for-word translation: In the original text, ""quartermaster's corral"" is translated literally as ""军需官的后部"" (jun xu guan de hou bu), which means ""back part of the quartermaster's office/department."" A more appropriate and literal translation of the word ""corral"" in this context is ""��Destination"" (zhao di), meaning a fenced or walled space for animals, which is more in line with the meaning of the original text.

3. Word omission: In the reference-quality text, the word ""there"" is included after ""on 21 October with 116 of the noncombatants, who were interned in the"" to improve fluency. However, the machine-generated text omits this word, which slightly impacts the fluency of the text.

In summary, the machine-generated text conveys the meaning of the original text, but slight modifications to the word order, word choice, and fluency can improve the overall quality of the text.

Improved machine-generated text:

10 月 21 日，我和 D 连 带着 116 名非战斗人员返回 Concho 堡 的 ��Destination ， 他们被关押在那里。

(On October 21, I and the D company returned to the corral of Fort Concho with 116 non-combatants who were interned there.)

522	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is quite different from the reference translation in this case.

The source text is in English and the reference translation is in Chinese. The goal is to translate the English sentence into Chinese.

The machine translation is ""The shrubbery is made up of one-fifth, four-fifths and four-fifths."" which is not a correct or meaningful Chinese sentence.

The reference translation, on the other hand, is ""The shrubbery consists of the species Pentzia monodiana, Artemisia tilhoana and Ephedra tilhoana."" which is a correct and accurate Chinese sentence.

The main issue with the machine translation is that it mistranslated the English words ""Pentzia monodiana, Artemisia tilhoana and Ephedra tilhoana"" as numbers ""one-fifth, four-fifths and four-fifths"".

A correct and accurate machine-generated Chinese sentence for the English sentence in the source should be: ""灌木丛由Pentzia monodiana, Artemisia tilhoana 和 Ephedra tilhoana 组成。""

It is important to note that the reference and the correct machine-generated sentence differ only in the word ""由"" and ""组成"" in the context of the given text. ""由"" implies a cause and ""组成"" implies a composition. Depending on the context, the correct word to use can vary. In this case, ""组成"" is the appropriate word to use.

523	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The source text is in English and the given machine and reference translations are in Chinese.

The source text describes a situation where a person named Isagani witnesses an instance of hallucination by another person, during which the other person confesses to the murder of Enrico while having a conversation with Joaquin.

The machine and reference translations both convey the main idea of the source text, namely that Isagani witnessed a conversation related to a confessed murder while the other person was hallucinating.

However, there are differences in the word order and sentence structure between the two Chinese translations.

In the machine-generated Chinese translation, the word order differs slightly from the reference, with ""Isagani"" placed at the beginning of the sentence followed by ""见证了"" (witnessed in English translation). The word ""Isagani"" is separated from the verb ""见证了"" by a comma, which is not present in the reference.

The reference, on the other hand, has ""Isagani"" placed after ""见证了"", with no punctuation in between.

Moreover, the reference has no space after the word "" witnessed"", which is not consistent with standard Chinese punctuation.

In summary, the two Chinese versions convey the same meaning, but the word order and punctuation differ slightly. The reference is closer to standard written Chinese, but the machine-generated version is still readable and understandable.

 The machine translation ""These structures usually reside in the chest, adjacent to the foregut."" is mostly accurate, but there is a slight difference when compared to the reference translation. In the reference translation, the foregut is specified to be ""front food canal/gullet"", which is more precise than just ""foregut"" in the machine Translation.

Here's the source and reference side-by-side for comparison:

Source. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut.

Reference: 这些结构通常居住在胸部，靠近前食道。(These structures usually reside in the chest, adjacent to the foregut/gullet.)

The reference to the ""gullet/gullet area"" is more precise and accurate in the reference Translation, as it clarifies the specific location of the ""thoracic foregut"" to be the ""front of the alimentary canal/gullet "" in the human or animal anatomy.

Therefore, the reference Translation is more accurate and detailed in this case.

However, if we compare the source text. We can find that the source text is using more elevated and poetic language, describing how the person's ""greater glory shines throughout his countenance/face/expression/presence etc.""

The machine and reference both translated the text literally, but the literalness of the language used in the target text does not convey the same meaning and nuance as the original.

A more nuanced and nuanced English-to-Chinese translation of the original text might be: ""他的尊荣在他的面容中闪耀着"".

In conclusion, the machine and reference both provide a literal and somewhat stale-sounding rendition of the original, which lack the elegance and expressiveness of the original.

(Note: ""波动"" (wave/disturbance) is used to convey the meaning of ""a shockwave that caused the morals of all the heroes and villains to flip/invert"" in the reference, as the word ""颠倒"" (flip/invert) is not appropriate for the situation.

527	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The source text in English is: ""B. Polin in a rather severe Interwar Stripped Classical style.""

The machine translation into Simplified Chinese is: 以相当严厉的间歇战式脱衣的波兰古典风格。

The reference translation into Simplified Chinese is: B.Polin处于严atore strict two war period of shedding classical style.

When comparing the machine and reference translations to the source text, there are a few differences to note:

1. The machine translation incorrect.ly translates ""Interwar"" as 间歇战 (""interval warfare"") style, rather than the correct translation of 两战期间 (two war period/interwar period style).
2. The machine and reference translations both use the incorrect term 脱衣 (disrobe/shed) to describe the style, rather than the correct 剥离 (strip/disengage/separate) to describe the separation of the style from its historical context.
3. Both the machine and reference use the incorrect word 古典 (classic/classical) to describe the style, which is actually a stripped-down version of the classical style.

The reference and machine-generated Chinese both contain errors, but the reference is closer to the intended meaning of the original text. A more accurate and nuanced Chinese rendering of the original text might be:

波兰设计师B.Polin沿用了相当严厉的两战期间脱 Classic风格。

(Polish designer B.Polin adopts a rather austere style of the interwar period.)

 The machine translation ""他在七场比赛中冲进了 1,790 码和 21 点"" differs from the reference translation ""他在七场比赛中冲刺了1790码，21次达阵"" in the following ways:

1. Measurement of yardage: In the machine-generated translation, the unit of measurement for rushing yards (yards) is missing. The reference correctly includes the unit of measurement (码, which means ""yards"" in Chinese).

Source: He rushed for 1,790 yards and 21 touchdowns in seven games.
Reference: 他在七场比赛中冲刺了1790码，21次达阵.

2. Representation of the word ""touchdowns"": The word ""touchdowns"" is translated as ""点"" in the machine-generated text, but the reference correctly renders it as ""达阵"", which is a more accurate and commonly used Chinese term for touchdown.

3. Word repetition: The word ""in seven games"" is repeated twice in the machine-generated text, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

Overall, the reference text is more accurate and closely reflects the meaning of the original English text. The machine-generated text contains errors and omits important information, making it less precise and less readable.

1. The term ""roller derby skater"" is translated as ""滚子滑冰运动员"" (gerozhui huixingyundongyuan) in the machine version, while the reference version has ""四轮滑冰冠军"" (simulaoluan guanjun). The reference's version is more appropriate, as it conveys the idea of a champion in the sport, while the literal term-for-term ( gerozhui huixingyundongyuan) is less evocative and lacks the nuance of the reference.

2. In the reference, the name ""Bogash"" is correctly localized to ""博加 shall"" (bogei shall) in the reference, while the machine version preserves the English spelling.

3. The overall sentence structure in the machine-generated text is less varied and less engaging, lacking the parallel structure of the reference.

In conclusion, the reference is more engaging and a more accurate representation of the intended meaning, as it effectively conveys the context and the specifics of the sport and the person involved. The machine-generated text, while not incomprehensible, lacks the nuance and engaging style of the reference.

 The source text describes the Argonauts performing a religious ritual (pouring libations) to the ghost of Sthenelus, and as a result, the three survivors are able to secure places aboard the ship named the Argo.

The machine translation provided. ""宇航员们把自由投向了仙人掌的幽灵，三名幸存者在阿尔戈号上获得了位置。"" can be broken down as follows:

* 宇航员们 (UYANGHUAN YUAN in pinyin, meaning ""astronauts"" or ""space travelers"" in this context due to the use of ""宇""—a prefix that can mean ""space"" or ""universe"" in Chinese)
* 把 (BA in pinyin, a particle that means ""to"" or ""and"" in this context, linking the subject and the verb)
* 自由 (ZI YOU in pinyin, meaning ""freedom"" or ""liberty"" in this context, due to the context of the action of pouring libations to the ghost of a hero, which can be seen as a form of freedom-giving ritual to the hero's spirit)
* 投向 (TOU XIANG in pinyin, meaning ""to pour towards/toward/on"" in this context, referring to the pouring of the libations to the hero's ghost)
* 了 (LE in pinyin, a grammatical particle that can indicate a change of state, a completed action, or a past tense depending on the context, in this case, it is linking the pouring of the libations to the gaining of the stowaway positions on the ship, indicating a result of the action, or a completed action in the past, which is not the intended meaning in the source text)

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Order of words: by analyzing the source sentence, we can notice that the word ""opus botanicum quo absolutius mundus non vidit"" is a Latin phrase, which translates to ""the absolute state of botany which the world has never seen."" In the machine-translated sentence, the Latin phrase is split up and translated individually, resulting in ""植物学现状的绝对性"" (zhiwuzhi xiankuang de juedui xing), which literally means ""the absoluteness of the current state of botany."" However, the reference translation maintains the original Latin phrase, making it more accurate to the source.

2. Word choice: the machine-generated sentence uses ""献上"" (linshang), meaning ""to dedicate or offer,"" while the reference-generated sentence uses ""献给"" (linshang gei), meaning ""to dedicate or present to."" Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference-generated version is more accurate to the original Latin phrase, ""opus botanicum quo absolutius mundus non vidit.""

Overall, the reference-generated sentence is more accurate to the original Latin phrase and conveys the intended meaning more clearly. The machine-generated sentence, while understandable, lacks the nuance and accuracy of the reference-generated version.

Both the machine and reference use the same Chinese terms, so there is no difference there.

However, the machine and reference differ slightly in the way they describe ""Elizabeth of York."" The source and reference both use the phrase "" Elizabeth of York,"" but the machine incorrectly uses ""侄女"" (zùnǜ), meaning ""aunt-in-law or sister-in-law of a son or daughter-in-law "" instead of ""姑娘"" (gūniang), meaning ""aunt or sister of a wife or husband "" to describe ""Elizabeth of York "" in the context of the sentence.

The reference correctly uses ""姑娘"" (gūniang) to refer to ""Elizabeth of York "" as the ""aunt of Henry Tudor "" in the sentence.

Therefore, the reference is more accurate in describing the relationship between ""Henry Tudor "" and ""Elizabeth of York "" in the sentence.

 The source text is about people converting to Roman Catholicism from pagan religions.

The machine translation, ""从异教皈依罗马天主教的人"", can be broken down as follows:

* 从 (from)
* 异教 (non-Christian religions or pagan religions)
* 皈依 (to convert or to embrace a religion, here referring to the action of converting to a religion, specifically, in this context, to Roman Catholicism)
* 罗马天主教 (Roman Catholic Church or the Roman Catholic religion, specifically)

However, the reference translation, ""从异教徒宗教转变为罗马天主教"", differs slightly in meaning.

Here, the key difference lies in the verb used to describe the act of changing religions.

In the reference, the verb ""转变"" (to change, to transform, to convert, to turn) is used, implying a more fundamental and profound change in religious beliefs.

In contrast, the verb ""皈依"" (to embrace, to adopt, to convert to, to accept) in the machine-generated text implies a more passive or accepting attitude towards the new faith, and may not fully convey the depth and seriousness of the religious change involved.

Moreover, the reference text also includes the verb ""变"" (to change, to transform, to convert, to turn) in the verb ""转变"", emphasizing the significant shift in religious affiliation.

In summary, the reference text is more precise and nuanced in conveying the meaning of the original English text, and the choice of a more appropriate verb in the reference contributes to a more accurate and faithful representation of the intended meaning.

The reference translation into Chinese is: ""他也非常��Qin1 Pi2 ci4 Garibaldi5 he2 de1 John1 Bruno1 Zhe3,1.""

When comparing the machine and reference translations to the source, the main discrepancy is the rendering of ""John Brown."" In the machine-generated text, ""John Bruno"" is used, while the reference correctly has ""John Brown.""

The difference is due to the proper name ""Brown"" being incorrect in the open research machine learning (OPUS) model, resulting in the substitution of the similar-sounding ""Bruno"" in the generated text.

To improve the quality of the machine-generated text.

1. Ensure the proper handling of proper nouns and entities, especially for well-known people and places.
2. Use a more sophisticated and updated language model that can recognize and generate proper noun entities.
3. Improving the quality of the source text and ensuring that the proper noun entities and other essential details are correct.

The reference and source differ because the reference is the correct and verified version of the target-language (Chinese) text, while the source is the English original.

To evaluate the overall quality of the English-to-Chinese translation, consider the fluency, accuracy, and structure of the generated text. In this specific case, the primary issue is the proper noun error, but the overall quality of the text is acceptable.

To improve the quality of the generated text, consider the suggestions mentioned above and use more sophisticated and updated language models. Additionally, ensure the proper use of punctuation, grammar, and word-choice to convey the intended meaning.

 The source English text describes how Lancelot's flattering chivalry wins over the impressionable young Elaine's heart.

The machine translation into Chinese is: 兰切洛特奉承骑士的风度赢得了年轻易感的爱琳的心.

The reference translation. which is presumably the correct one, is: 兰切洛特奉承的骑士风度赢得了年轻易感的爱琳的心.

Upon comparison, the only noticeable difference between the machine and reference translation is the order of two words: 兰切洛特 (Lancelot) and 奉承 (flattering chivalry). In the reference, 兰切洛特 (Lancelot) is placed first, followed by 奉承的骑士风度 (flattering chivalry of), while in the machine, the word order is reversed, placing 奉承 (flattering) first, followed by 骑士 (knight) and 的风度 (of style or manner).

This discrepancy is minor and doesn't significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. However, it's worth noting that consistency in word order is crucial for readability and fluency, especially in a language like Chinese, where the word order differs from English. Therefore, it's advisable to prioritize consistency with the reference in future similar tasks.

However, the reference translation is identical to the source text, while the machine translation differs slightly in its use of punctuation and formatting.

In the source text, the Latin name ""Publius Cornelius L.f.P.n.Cethegus"" is written as one continuous string of characters, with no spaces or punctuation. The machine translation inserts spaces between the different elements of the name, resulting in ""Publius Cornelius L. f. P. n. Cethegus"".

In addition, the reference translation includes a full-width period character (""."") after the year 181 BC, while the machine translation uses a half-width period (""."").

While neither of these differences significantly alters the meaning or accuracy of the text, the reference translation is a more literal and precise rendering of the original Latin. The use of a continuous string of characters for the Latin name is a convention used in Latin texts, and the reference translation preserves this convention.

Therefore, the reference translation may be considered a more faithful representation of the original Latin, while the machine translation is a more readable and accessible version for modern audiences.

 The source English text mentions that Hardy defeated one of the Imposter Willows. However, both the machine and reference Chinese translations use the term ""大野兽"" (Dà yěshòu) which means ""wild beast"" or ""big animal"" to refer to the imposter Willow.

The reference Chinese translation is ""基辅哥萨克人起义和乌克兰的民族觉醒.""

Comparing the two Chinese translations, the reference version is more accurate in reflecting the meaning of the original English text.

First, the subject of the source text is the ""Kiev Cossack revolt and national awakening inUkraine."" The reference version reflects this by including ""Ukraine"" after ""national awakening,"" indicating that the awakening is happening in the context of the country ofUkraine. In contrast, the machine-generated version simply has ""national awakening"" (民族觉醒) and does not specify the location.

Second, the reference version correctly uses ""人"" (rén) to indicate people or a group of people, in this case, the ""Cossack people"" (基辅哥萨克人). The machine-generated version does not include this character, resulting in a less clear meaning.

Overall, the reference version of the Chinese translation is more accurate and reflects the meaning of the original English text more closely. The machine-generated version makes two errors, one in omitting the location of the ""national awakening"". In the other, it fails to specify the subject of the ""revolt"" as a group of people.

 The source English text describes how Tamar's armies, led by two Christianized Kurdish generals, dislodged the Shaddadid dynasty from Ani in the year 1199.

The machine translation into Chinese provides a literal translation of the source, preserving the structure and meaning of the original sentence. However, the reference translation differs slightly in wording and phrasing.

Here are the differences:

1. Word usage:
The reference translation uses ""两名基督教库尔德将军"" (two Christianized Kurdish generals) to describe the generals, whereas the machine simply has ""两名基督教库尔德将军"" (two Kurdish Christian generals).
2. Sentence structure:
The reference has a more compact and concise phrasing, with the subject (Tamar's armies) placed at the beginning of the sentence, while the machine's version is more similar to the English original.
3. Word choice:
The reference has ""从阿尼（Ani）手中结束了沙达迪德（Shaddadid）王朝"" (End the Shaddadid dynasty from the hands of Ani, which is a more vivid and expressive description.

In summary, the reference and the machine's version both convey the same meaning, but the reference is more concise and expressive. The reference prioritizes fluency and readability, while the machine prioritizes a literal word-for-word approach.

 The source English text describes an event. The Titanic sank in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during its maiden voyage.

The machine translation in Chinese accurately conveys the meaning of the source English text, but it differs slightly from the reference translation.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is in the wording of the sentence. The reference translation places the word ""first"" (首次) in the sentence, implying that the collision was the first and only voyage of the ship. However, the word ""first"" is not explicitly stated in the source English text.

The machine translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English text, but it is more literal and does not include the additional information provided in the reference translation.

Here is a possible revised machine translation that is closer to the reference translation:

1912年，她在首次航行时与冰山相撞，沉没了。

This revised machine translation is more nuanced and more accurately reflects the meaning of the reference translation.

When comparing the machine and reference Chinese translations. We can observe that the reference Chinese text is more accurate than the machine one.

The reference correctly uses ""��ian妈妈"" (yīngmáma) to refer to the female eagle, and ""小秃鹰"" (xiǎorurugu) to refer to the buzzard. The machine, on the other hand, incorrectly uses ""老鹰"" (lǎoyīng) to refer to the older bird, and ""幼虫"" (tángchóng) to refer to the buzzard.

Moreover, the reference text correctly depicts the scene of the female bird ""coming to hatch"" (孵化) the young one, while the machine incorrecty interprets it as ""taking care of"" (抚育).

Solution:

1. The word ""coda"" in the original text refers to ""a closing, final, or concluding part of something."" In linguistics, it specifically refers to ""a consonant or group of consonants occurring at the end of a syllable or near the end of a word, after the vowel sound has ended (as p, t, d, f, k, in hop, lid, pad, laf). A coda may consist of one or more phonetic segments, called codas, which are strung on to the nucleus of the syllable, after the vowel or diphthong, to form the complete syllable (as in the case of the word at in atter, atone, at large, etc.).

1. Word Selection: The word ""this critic"" in the source text is translated as ""this position critic"" (这位评论家) in the machine translation, which is not a common or idiomatic way to refer to a critic in English. A more appropriate wording might be ""the critic"" (评论家) or ""this critic"" (这个评论家).

2. Word Order: In the reference translation, the word ""Hollyoaks"" (好莱坞) is placed after the verb ""praised"" (赞扬) in the machine-generated text, but in the reference, it appears at the beginning of the sentence.

3. Sentence Structure: The reference translation uses a more common and straightforward sentence structure, with the verb ""praised"" (赞扬) appearing at the beginning of the sentence, followed by the subject ""the critic"" (评论家) and the complement ""the brilliant idea of coupling Grace and Trevor"" (将格雷斯和特雷弗 ""巧妙"" 结合在一起). The machine-generated version, on the other hand, places the complement first, followed by the verb and the subject, resulting in a slightly more awkward and less clear sentence structure.

Overall, the machine-generated text is understandable and conveys the meaning of the original text, but it could be improved in terms of wording, sentence structure, and fluency. A more carefully crafted and nuanced human-generated text would be preferable for formal or professional purposes.

The machine-generated Chinese translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, stating that the English used to mainly drink strong dark beer. However, the reference Chinese translation is identical to the machine-generated one.

The primary difference is the wording of the second part of the sentence. The machine-generated text says ""而淡淡的啤酒却占了主导地位"" (ér dàn dàn yē pí jiu que zhan le zhuling diwei), which literally means ""while pale ales instead took a dominant position."" The reference text says ""而淡淡的啤酒却成为了主要的"" (ér dàn dàn yē pí jiu cheng wei le zhuyao de), which literally means ""while pale ales instead became the main ones.""

Both are grammatically correct and convey the same meaning, but the reference version is slightly more verbose. The reference version also emphasizes the ""becoming the main ones"" aspect, while the machine-generated one emphasizes the ""taking a dominant position"" aspect.

In summary, the primary difference is the nuance of the wording, but the overall meaning is conveyed in both the reference and the machine-generated text.

* 南部 (nánbù) means the southern part, but it can also mean ""south of / just south of"".
* 以南 (yǐnán) is a Chinese preposition that is used to express ""southern part of / to the south of / south of"".

The reference-quality human-generated Chinese text, ""传统的纪念章，嵌成花纹，以及几何设计是最常见的"", accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, with ""纪念章"" (commemorative plaque) being used instead of ""奖章"" (medallion/award/prize) and ""嵌成花纹"" (inlaid with floral/ornamental patterns) clarifying the type of tessellated and geometric designs mentioned.

The primary discrepancy in the machine-generated text is the lack of clarity in the meaning of ""tessellated and geometric designs"" - the literal translation of the two English words is used, but the concept of ""tessellated designs"" is not commonly expressed as ""点缀"" (embellishments) in Chinese.

Therefore, the reference-level human-generated text is more accurate and nuanced, providing a clear and culturally appropriate representation of the original English.

597	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation has several issues when compared to the reference translation. Here are some of the main differences:

1. Word choice: The words used in the machine-generated text are not always accurate or idiomatic. For example, the word ""intermixture"" in the original text is translated as ""交融"" (jiāoróng) in the machine-generated text, but a more appropriate word might be ""合并"" (hébìng), which is used in the reference text.

2. Sentence structure: The sentence structure in the machine-generated text is often awkward and unclear. For example, the phrase ""and partial conquest by Germanic tribes"" in the original text is translated as ""与撩入撒利安法兰克等日耳曼部落的交融和部分征服"" (yú liánrào Sàiliernán Fǎolánfēng děi rì'ěrman fánbùluò de jiāoróng hé bùfan qínɡshè), which is a cumbersome and confusing way to express the idea. A clear and straightforward way to express the idea might be ""撩入撒利安法兰克等日耳曼部落并逐步征服"" (liáorào Sàiliernán Fǎolánfēng děi rì'ěrman fánbùluò bìng zhónvéi qínɡshè), as used in the reference text.

3. Literal translation: The machine-generated text often seems to be a literal word-for-word translation, which can result in awkward and unclear phrasing. For example, the word ""Germanic"" in the original text is translated as ""德意志"" (Déyìzhì) in the machine-generated text, but a more appropriate word might be ""德国"" (Déguó), which is used in the reference text.

In summary, the reference text is a clear and straightforward expression of the idea, whereas the machine-generated text is often awkward, confusing, and unclear. The reference text is a more accurate and readable representation of the original text.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a few minor differences.

1. The word ""noted"" in the source text is translated as ""noted"" in the machine translation, but it should be ""著名的"" (noted as ""an renowned person"" or ""famous"") in the reference translation.
2. The word ""forger"" in the source text is translated as ""伪造者"" (forger) in the machine translation, but it should be ""伪造者"" (forger) in the reference translation.

Here is the corrected version of the machine-generated text:

暴君是一个著名的伪造者，罗马尼亚学者安德烈·皮皮迪将其描述为“巧妙的骗子”和“专业冒名顶替者”。

Overall, the machine-generated text is of good quality, but it is important to pay attention to details and ensure that the meaning of the words in the original text are accurately reflected in the target language.

The reference Translation provided is: ""查尔斯·戈迪的版画和查尔斯·希弗的水彩版画两本装订对开本"" which can be translated to ""Charles Goldie's prints and Charles Heaphy's watercolor prints in two bound volumes.""

Comparing the two translations, the main difference is that the machine-generated one does not make it clear that the prints and watercolour prints belong to different individuals, and also does not specify that the items are in two separate bound volumes. The reference and source text both specify that the prints and watercolours belong to different individuals, and that the items are in two separate bound volumes.

Overall, the reference and source text convey more specific and complete information than the machine-generated one. The reference and source text both specify the format of the items (folios and prints/watercolours) and the fact that the items belong to different individuals, which the machine-generated one does not. Additionally, the reference and source text specify the format of the items (folios and prints/watercolours) and the fact that the items are in two separate bound volumes, which the machine-generated one does not.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Order of events: In the machine translation, the masts protruding from the water is described after the survivors getting into the boats and rowing to shore. However, in the reference translation, the masts protruding from the water is described before the survivors getting into the boats and rowing to shore.
2. Tense consistency: The machine translation uses present continuous tense for the masts protruding from the water (""its tree trunk protruding from the water is"" vs ""its tree trunk protruded from the water as"" in the reference translation).
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""船"" which means boat or ship, while the reference uses ""小船"" which means small boat.

In summary, the machine-generated Chinese translation differs from the reference in terms of the sequence of the description, the tense, and the specificity of the word used for the boat. The reference is more vivid and accurate in describing the scene.

 The source English text describes a scene in the 1981 film ""Pennies from Heaven"". In this scene, there is a tableau vivant of ""Nighthawks"" with the lead actors taking the place of the diners.

The machine translation provided into Chinese is close, but not quite accurate. The first part of the sentence is translated correctly, stating that the film is from 1981 and is called ""PeniesfromHeaven"" (a slight error as it should be ""Penies/Pennies from Heaven""). However, the second half of the sentence is where the inaccuracy occurs.

The machine incorrectly interprets ""tableau vivant of Nighthawks"" as ""one table of the night scene"" (一首夜色的台词), which is not an accurate or meaningful phrase in this context.

The reference translation, on the other hand, correctly interprets the scene, stating that the 1981 film ""Pennies from Heaven"" contains a scene with ""Nighthawks"" (夜鹰), and the main actors are shown in the process of dining.

In summary, the main difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the inaccurate interpretation of the ""Nighthawks"" scene, which is crucial to the meaning of the original text.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Word Choice: In the machine translation, the phrase ""裂痕"" (lei han) is used to translate ""riff"", which is not an accurate translation. A ""riff"" in music refers to a repeated phrase or chord progression unchanged throughout a section of a song or piece. A more appropriate translation would be ""音 riffs"" (yin riffs) or ""�� liu riff"".

2. Sentence Construction: In the reference translation, the verb ""will"" is used twice to convey the meaning of each musician's actions. However, the machine translation uses the same verb ""will"" (will/will follow) for both musicians, making the sentence less clear.

3. Idiomatic Expressions: In the reference translation, the phrase ""contingent upon the context, will accompany/accompanied by an improvised melody"" is used to convey the meaning of ""伴着即兴旋律唱歌"". The machine-generated version does not convey this meaning as effectively.

A more accurate and nuanced machine-generated version might look something like this:

�DiO 会在曲ragged 边缘上唱歌，而Ozzy 则会跟随固定的旋律，就像在《钢铁侠》中一样。

Here, the word ""曲ragged 边缘上"" (qu Curragh bianduān shàng) is used to convey the meaning of ""riff"" in a more idiomatic way, and the verb ""跟随"" (gen jiu) is used to convey the meaning of ""follow the riff"" in a more nuanced manner. Additionally, the word ""固定的"" (gu dignity de) is added to make the meaning of the repeated phrase or chord progression more explicit.

 The source text is discussing a TV show or movie, ""Teen Titans,"" and mentions that the actor Shemar Moore will reprise his role.

The machine translation, ""少年泰坦 ， 与 Shemar Moore 报复他的角色"". can be broken down as follows:

* 少年泰坦: ""Teen Titans"" (literally ""Young/teenage Titans"")
* 与: and
* Shemar Moore: correctly translated
* 报复: to avenge or revenge
* 他的角色: his role

The reference Translation, ""少年泰坦这一角色由谢玛·摩尔（ShemarMoore）再次饰演"" can be analyzed as:

* 少年泰坦: ""Teen Titans"" (literally ""Young/teenage Titans"")
* 这一: the

* 由: by
* 谢玛·摩尔（ShemarMoore）: ""Shemaar Moore""
* 再次: again

The source text states that ""boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat"" while the machine and reference Translation use the phrase ""boat traffic and dredging make the habitat degrade.""

The verb ""degrades"" implies that boat traffic and dredging are actively causing harm to the habitat, whereas ""makes the habitat degrade"" implies that the actions contribute to the habitat becoming degraded, but it does not necessarily mean that the habitat is currently in a degraded condition.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in a few ways. First, the machine. translation uses ""two flutes or two violins with a drum"". However, the reference translation specifies ""two flutess or two violins *with a drum*"" (emphasis added). The use of ""with a drum"" rather than ""two flutes or two violins and a drum"" implies that the two instruments are paired together and played together, rather than having a drum as an additional instrument.

Second, the machine. translation uses ""two small flutes or two-support violins with a drum"" while the reference. translation uses ""two flutes or two-support violins with a drum"". The use of ""small flute"" in the machine.

The reference. translation is more appropriate as the term ""small flute"" is not commonly used to refer to a specific type of flute.

The machine-generated translation, however, directly translates ""skate sharpener"" as ""滑冰磨刀"" (literally ""skate grind knife""), which is less clear in meaning and not idiomatic in Chinese.

2. Word order and grammatical correctness:

The word ""and"" in the original English sentence is missing in the machine-generated text, which can make the sentence confusing.

3. Idiom and style:

The reference text is more idiomatic and culturally adapted to the target language, using the phrase ""把溜冰鞋磨锋利的人"" (literally ""the person who makes the skate blades keen/sharp"") to convey the meaning of ""skate sharpener"" in a more culturally-sensitive manner.

A better, more nuanced and culturally-sensitive, machine-generated Chinese version would be:

1. Order of elements: In the machine translation. ""Sting challenged"" (斯汀挑战了) appears after ""inaugural Clash of the Champions in March 1988"" (1988 年 3 月的首届冠军赛上), while in the reference translation, ""Sting challenged Ric Flair"" (Sting 向 Ric Flair 挑战) appears after ""at the inaugural Clash of the Champions in March 1988"" (在1988年3月举行的首届冠军争霸战中).

The reference translation is closer to the original in preserving the order of the elements, as ""Sting challenged Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship "" (Sting 向 Ric Flair 挑战了 NWA 世界重量级冠军) is the main event of the original sentence.

2. Word choice: In the machine-generated text, ""NWA 世界重量级锦标赛 "" (NWA 世界重量级冠军) is used to refer to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, while in the reference text, ""NWA 世界重量级冠军"" (NWA 世界重量级冠军) is used.

1. Measure words: The source and reference use different measure words for the number of birds introduced. In English, we use the plural ""birds"" without a specific measure word, while in Chinese, we use the measure word ""only"" (个) for small animals. The machine correctly includes the character ""只"" (which means ""only"" or ""a pair of"") after each number in the Chinese version, but the reference version only includes it after the first instance of the number.
2. Word usage: The word ""引进"" (referring to ""to introduce"" or ""to translocate/translocate"" in this context) is used consistently in the machine and reference versions. However, the reference version also includes the word ""州"" (abbreviation for ""province"" or ""state"") after ""内布拉斯加"" (the name of the U.S. state of Nebraska) to specify the location, while the machine version does not.
3. Sentence structure: The reference version rephrases the English sentence slightly to make the grammatical structure more parallel across the three instances of introducing the birds. The reference sentence is: ""1971年，内布拉斯加州引进了256只优雅的凤头金丝雀，1969年引进了217只，1971年至1977年间引进了1200只。"" (1971, the elegant-crested flycatchers were introduced in Nebraska, 217 in 1969, and 1200 from 1971 to 1977.)

 The source text is discussing how the concept of Lex Luthor (Luthor) and Clark Kent becoming friends when they are both young men has been reimagined in the context of ""Birthright.""

The machine's English-to-Chinese translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, but there are a few differences between the machine's version and the reference version.

1. Word choice: The word ""reinvents"" in the original English is translated as ""重新创造了"" (reinvented/recreated) in the machine's version, but the reference version uses ""重新发明了"" (reinvented/reimagined) to convey the same meaning.

2. Sentence structure: The word order in the original English is preserved in the machine's version, but the reference version restructures the sentence slightly to make it flow more naturally in Chinese.

3. Word segmentation: The reference version separates ""伯特赖特"" (Birthright) and ""白银时代"" (Silver Age) with a comma, while the machine's version does not.

The reference Translation, ""在DC漫画上的路易斯·莱恩在DC数据库维基上的路易斯·莱恩在Smallville维基上的路易斯·莱恩"" is also a literal translation of the original source, but broken down further to reflect the context of the source.

In the reference Translation, ""在DC漫画上的"" is translated to ""in the DC comics"" to specify the context of the source, ""Lois Lane"". ""Lois Lane"" is left untranslated, as it is already in English and recognizable to English-speaking readers.

""在 DC 数据库 Wikia Lois Lane"" is broken down to ""at the DC Database Wikia, the Lois Lane page"" to specify the subject of the source.

""在 Smallville Wikia 上的"" is further broken down to ""on the Smallville Wikia page"" to specify the platform.

In comparison, the machine Translation lacked fluency and proper segmentation to reflect the intended meaning of the original source. The reference Translation, on the other hand, reflected the intended meaning of the original source, with proper grammatical structure and fluency in the English language.

 The source text is in English and the reference translation is in Chinese. Both the machine and reference translations are in Chinese.

The difference between the machine and reference Chinese translations is in the wording of the animal referred to in the sentence. The source English sentence refers to ""some species of salamander"" while the machine-generated Chinese text says ""某些种类的沙兰"", which also means ""some species of salamander"" in Chinese.

However, the reference Chinese text has a slightly different word for the animal, saying ""某些种类的蝾螣"" (mò jǐ zhōng léi), which is a less commonly used but still correct name for the amphibian.

Therefore, the main discrepancy in the two Chinese texts is the word for the animal, but it is not a significant difference in meaning. Both the reference and the machine-generated text convey the same overall meaning.

While both versions convey the same meaning. The reference version is more precise and accurate in conveying the nuance of the original text, as it explicitly mentions the involvement of a ""person/people"" (in this case, the surety/guarantor/co-defendant) with the ""he"" (the person being sued by the court/county in this case).

Therefore, the reference version is more accurate and desirable for this particular context.

2. Word selection: the word ""shorting"" in the original sentence is translated as ""缩短"" (suozhuanDUAN) in the machine version, which means ""to shorten/decrease/reduce the length of something "" in the context of the reference, it is more appropriate to use ""缩短"" (suozhuanDUAN) for ""circuits"" (cirsimcuits in the reference is a literal translation of ""电路"", which is not incorrect, but it is more appropriate to use ""短路"" (duanDAO) in this context, meaning ""to short-circuit/to be short-circuited/to be cut off"").

1. Word order: The word order in the machine-generated sentence is different from the reference one. The reference sentence follows the typical SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order of English, while the machine-generated one is closer to the typical SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order of Chinese.
2. Vocabulary: The verb ""splits off "" in the machine-generated sentence is not an accurate or appropriate choice. ""Fen1ie4le4"" (分裂) is a verb that usually refers to something splitting or separating into multiple pieces, not branching or forking.
3. Sentence structure: The verb ""forks "" in the reference sentence is a more appropriate and accurate choice. ""Diverges "" or ""branches off "" is more suitable for expressing the meaning of the original English sentence.

Overall, the reference sentence is a better and more accurate reflection of the original English sentence. The machine-generated sentence contains errors and is less clear in meaning.

The reference translation. ""歌手兼摄影师牛顿·托马斯·西格尔（NewtonThomasSigel）为影片的两部分选择了不同的风格。""

When comparing the machine and reference translations, the main difference is in the wording used to describe the subject of the sentence. The reference text identifies Newton Thomas Sigel as a ""singer and cinematographer,"" while the machine version simply refers to him as ""songwriter and film photographer."" Additionally, the reference version specifies that Newton Thomas Sigel made style choices for ""two parts of the film,"" while the machine version refers to ""separate halves of the film.""

In terms of overall fluency and naturalness, the reference version flows better and is easier to understand. The machine version is somewhat awkward and may be difficult for a non-expert reader to understand.

In summary, the main differences between the machine and reference versions are in the specificity and accuracy of the language used to describe the subject, as well as the overall fluency and naturalness of the text.

2. Sentence structure: The sentence structure in the machine-generated text is awkward and unclear. For instance, ""a short drive from Favre's hometown"" is translated as ""a simple driver from the hometown of Favre"" in the machine-generated text, which is confusing and ungrammatical.
3. Lack of fluency: The machine-generated text lacks fluency and flow, making it difficult for the reader to understand.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation follow the source text closely in terms of meaning. However, there are some differences in wording and style.

The main difference is that the machine translation renders ""at touchdown"". as ""当他们在触地时侧面移动时"" (when they moved sideways at touchdown in the machine-generated text, while the reference and the source text both use ""at touchdown"" to refer to the moment of touchdown.

Moreover, the reference and the source texts use the verb ""press into"" to describe the action of the footpads, while the machine-generated text uses the verb ""挤进"" (literally ""push in"" or ""intrude into"").

In summary, the machine-generated text conveys the meaning of the original text, but it differs slightly in terms of wording and phrasing. A more accurate and nuanced rendering of the original text might be: ""在一些照片中，脚垫确实挤进了表层，尤其是当他们在着陆时侧面移动时"" (lit. ""In some photos, the footpads really did press into the surface, especially when they moved sideways at touchdown time"" in the machine-generated text). However, the reference and the source texts use a more straightforward and concise phrasing, which is preferable in this context.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the transcription of the English proper names ""Mohawk"" and ""Tuscarora."" The machine translation uses the phonetic transcriptions ""穆���en however, dao"" and ""图斯卡羅拉"" to represent these names in Chinese, while the reference translation uses the conventional transcriptions ""莫霍克"" and ""塔斯卡洛拉"" respectively.

In addition, the machine translation uses ""白人"" to translate the word ""white"" in ""white Loyalists,"" while the reference translation uses ""白人"" to translate the word ""loyalists"" in ""white Loyalists.""

Overall, the machine translation is understandable but less accurate compared to the reference translation. The reference translation correctly preserves the proper nouns and their conventional transcriptions in Chinese, while the machine translation uses phonetic transcriptions that may not be easily recognizable by Chinese readers. The reference translation is also more consistent in its word choice, using ""忠诚"" to modify ""主义者"" in the context of ""Loyalists"" throughout the text.

The machine-generated Chinese translation reads: ""在这两种情况下 ， 汞从太阳中分离出来的时间都在太阳周围的 17.9 度至太阳周围的 27.8 度之间。""

The reference (human-generated) Chinese Translation reads: ""在这两个时间段中，水星与太阳的分离范围从近日点的17.9°到顶面点的27.8°。""

Comparing the two Chinese translations, the reference one is more accurate and clear. The main difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the word ""分离"" (fēnliè, separate/divorce) in the machine-generated one, which is not appropriate in this context. The reference text correctly uses ""分离范围"" (fēnlièfánwei, separation range/distance apart) to describe the phenomenon. Additionally, the word ""时间段"" (shíjiān duàn, time period/time span) in the machine-generated text is not accurate, as the original text refers to the two extreme positions of the planet, not a time period. The reference text correctly refers to ""这两个时间段"" (zhè liǎng gè shíjiān duàn, these two time periods/moments).

Therefore, the machine-generated text contains errors in wording and meaning, and it is less clear and precise compared to the reference text.

The reference (human) English-to-Chinese-simplified text provided is: ""&#x08;威尔士反绣线倾向后退，而针织线倾向向前，使织物有更大的延展性。""

Comparing the two, the reference text is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text. The key difference is the description of the two types of stitches: the source and reference texts use ""purl"" and ""knit"" respectively, while the machine-generated text incorrectly repeats ""knit-stitching (针织)"" for both.

Moreover, the reference text correctly interprets the meaning of the stretch in the material, using the word ""延展性 (delaying xing, lit. extensibility)"", while the machine-generated text simply repeats the word ""伸缩性 (shash xing, lit. extensibility and compressibility)"", which is less precise.

In summary, the reference text is more accurate and precise in conveying the meaning of the original English text. The machine-generated text contains errors in the interpretation of the two types of weaves and the meaning of the stretch in the material.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same basic meaning as the source text, but there are some differences in wording and emphasis.

Here is a more detailed comparison:

1. Word order: In the source text, the phrase ""where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity"" describes the location mentioned earlier, Oriole Park. In the reference translation, the same idea is expressed using the phrase ""露丝和他的队友在那里相当隐秘"", which literally translates to ""Ruth and his teammates were relatively obscure/unknown there."" In contrast, the machine translation renders this phrase as ""露丝和他的队友在那里相当隐秘"", which literally translates to ""Ruth and his teammates were relatively mysterious/secretive there."" This wording slightly changes the meaning of the sentence, making it sound like the team was doing something secretive or mysterious, rather than simply being relatively unknown.

2. Word usage: In the reference translation, the word ""隐秘"" (yǐn mì) is used to describe the obscurity of the team. While this word can mean ""obscure"" or ""unknown,"" it can also mean ""secretive"" or ""mysterious."" In contrast, the word ""obscurity"" in the source text is more straightforward and unambiguously means ""not widely known or celebrated.""

3. Sentence structure: The reference translation breaks the sentence into two parts, with the first part describing the small number of fans and the second part describing the relative obscurity of the players. In contrast, the source text combines these two ideas into one sentence, with the clause ""where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity"" describing the location mentioned earlier. The machine translation follows the same structure as the reference, but with the slightly different wording discussed above.

Overall, the reference and machine translations both convey the same meaning as the original, but the reference is more faithful to the original word usage and avoids the slightly misleading word ""secretive/mysterious"" in the machine-generated version. Additionally, the reference is more literal in its word-for-word rendering of the original, while the machine-generated text is slightly more idiomatic in its word choices.

The reference translation uses the term ""不高的"" which means ""modest"" or ""unimpressive"" to describe the two-star rating, while the machine-generated version uses ""少量的"" which translates to ""a modest amount of/few "" and implies that the rating is still positive.

In this context, the reference is more accurate as the original English sentence implies that the rating was low and not impressive. The word ""only"" in the original sentence emphasizes the low rating, and the machine-generated version fails to convey this meaning.

Overall, the reference and machine-generated versions both provide an accurate representation of the original text, but the reference version is more precise in reflecting the intended meaning.

A better choice might be ""遮盖"" (covered over) or ""遮 Screen off/cover"" (screen/cover off) to preserve the meaning of painting over something that was already there.
2. Punctuation: The lack of commas in the machine-generated text makes it harder to read and understand.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a few places. by analyzing the differences, we can evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation.

1. Brains of fish vs. fish's brain
In the source text. ""the brains of fish"" refers to the brain of all fish in general. The machine and reference translations both use a more specific term, ""fish's brain,"" which might refer to the brain of a single specimen.

2. Wanes vs. messes retreat
""The moon wanes"" describes the natural process of the moon's phases, specifically the period when it appears to get smaller. The reference and machine translations use ""the moon messes retreat,"" which is not an accurate reflection of the original text. ""Messes retreat"" is not an established term or an accurate description of the phenomenon.

3. Shrink vs. shrivel
""Shrink"" and ""shrivel up"" both convey the idea of something getting smaller. However, ""shrink"" implies a more controlled or deliberate process, while ""shrivel up"" conveys a more uncontrolled, withered appearance. In this context, the reference and machine translations use ""shrink"" and ""shrivel up"" respectively.

4. When the moon dies
The concept of the ""moon dying"" is not accurate, as the celestical body does not die. The reference and machine translations use ""when the moon dies"" and ""when the moon is dead"" respectively, but a better choice might be ""when the moon disappears/fails to appear/is no longer visible/does not exist.""

5. Wasps and crabs
The source mentions ""wasps and crabs"" as the entities affected by the ""death of the moon."" The reference and machine translations use ""wasps and crabs"" and ""yellow jackets and crabs"" respectively. ""Yellow jackets"" might not be the best choice, as it refers to a specific type of wasp, not the general category.

In conclusion, the reference and machine-generated Chinese versions differ slightly in the specificity of the language, the description of the phenomena, and the wording of the entities involved. The reference version is more accurate and adheres closer to the original text. The machine-generated text contains some errors and less precise word choices.

In the reference (human) translation, the word 蝌蚪 (tadpole) is used, while in the machine-generated text, the word 苔藓 (moss, algae) is used.

This discrepancy arises. because the machine misunderstood the word ""frogs"" as ""frog eggs"" or ""tadpoles"" and assumed that 青蛙 (frog) referred to the early life stage of a frog, leading to the inaccurate use of 苔藓 (algae) in the context of fewer tadpoles.

The reference and source texts use 蝌蚪 (tadpole) to refer to the larval stage of a frog, which is the correct word to use. Therefore, the reference and source texts convey the same meaning, but the machine-generated one does not.

 The source text in English is: ""Lesser appointments he delegated to his vizier or to the priests themselves.""

The machine translation into Chinese is: 他把较小的约会委托给他的牧师或牧师自己。

The reference translation into Chinese is: 他把较小的任务委派给他的大臣或牧师自己。

When comparing the machine and reference translations to the source text, the main difference is in the translation of ""Lesser appointments"" as ""较小的约会"" (small appointments or meetings in the machine-generated text) instead of ""较小的任务"" (small tasks in the reference text and in the source text, which is a more accurate reflection of the original intent of the text, as ""tasks"" or ""duties"" fit the context more closely than ""meetings"" or ""appointments"").

Therefore, the reference and source texts convey the meaning of the original text better, as the vizier and the priests received delegated tasks or duties, not just small meetings. The word ""delegated"" also implies tasks, and the reference and source texts reflect this nuance.

Moreover, the reference and source texts use the word ""delegated"" (委派, in the reference text and delegated, in the source text, respectively) while the machine-generated text has a different word (委托, in the machine-generated text, which is more commonly used for appointing or entrusting a task to someone, but not delegating a task to them, as delegation implies a more significant level of responsibility and authority, which fits the meaning of the text better).

In summary, the reference and source texts accurately convey the meaning of the delegation of tasks, while the machine-generated text has a less accurate reflection of the meaning, with a different word and a less precise meaning.

 The source text is in English and the reference translation is in Chinese. The machine translation is also in Chinese.

When comparing the machine translation to the reference translation. We can see that the machine translation is quite close to the reference, but there is one difference in the name of the person who founded the Giants. In the source text, the person's name is written as ""John B."" while in the reference, it is written as ""JohnB"" with no space between the two names.

The machine, however, translated the name as ""约翰·鲍尔"" (Consed as ""John H. Boal "" in English "" ), which is not consistent with either the source or the reference.

It's important to note that the proper name is not translated in this context, and should be left as ""约翰B."" (Considered as ""Consen as 'john b.' "" in English "" )

 compared to the reference translation ""旋风队的主场是康尼岛木板路的MCU公园，在纽约市布鲁克林区里"", the following differences can be observed:

* The order of elements in the machine-generated sentence differs from the reference, with location information (Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York City) placed after the main subject (the team ""Cyclones"" in the reference, but only ""play"" in the machine-generated sentence)
* The reference explicitly mentions the location of the field as ""MCU Park"", while the machine-generated sentence simply refers to it as a generic ""公园"" (park)
* The reference specifies the location of the field. ""the field next to the Coney Island boardwalk in the Brooklyn area of New York City"", but the machine-generated sentence does not.

Overall, the machine-generated sentence lacks the precision and detail of the reference, and it places location-related information in an unusual order, potentially leading to confusion for the reader. Additionally, the lack of specific field name and location context may also contribute to the loss of meaning.

The reference Chinese translation ""苦难之洋逐渐衰弱，直到11月2日消散."" also conveys the meaning of the original text, but uses different phrasing to describe the phenomenon.

In particular, the reference translation uses the phrase ""苦难之洋"" which literally translates to ""misery ocean/sea/body of water/weather system/atmosphere/climate/state of affairs/situation/plight"" to describe the weather phenomenon. The use of this phrase adds a poetic and dramatic flair to the description, emphasizing the severity and impact of the weather phenomenon.

In contrast, the machine and human translations both use simpler and more straightforward language to describe the phenomenon, with the human-generated reference text using the phrase ""气候"" (atmosphere/climate) to describe the phenomenon.

6. The reference-generated text is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text, but it is still not entirely accurate.

In conclusion, the reference-generated text is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text, but it is still not entirely accurate. The primary issue with the reference-generated and machine-generated texts is that neither of them conveys the meaning of ""offered vassalage under the Spanish to reclaim his crown"" from the original text.

To improve the accuracy of the generated text, the following steps can be taken:

1. Ensure the correct understanding of the meaning of the original text.

2. Use appropriate and accurate terms to convey the meaning of the original text.

3. Double-check the generated text for accuracy.

4. Use a combination of manual and automated methods to ensure the accuracy of the generated text.

5. Regular updates and fine-tuning of the automated system to improve its performance.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original English source text, and they convey the same meaning. However, upon closer examination.

The character "" sects"" (教派). in the machine-generated text might not be the best fit, as the word ""sects"" might imply a negative connotation, while the original English text simply refers to different groups. A more appropriate word might be ""team"" or ""group"" (团队 or 群组) depending on the context.

The reference and the source share the same wording, but it is important to note that the reference is not always the best indicator of quality, as it might contain errors or biases. Therefore, a careful evaluation of the context and purpose of the text should be taken into account.

In summary, the machine-generated text is accurate, but a slight modification to the word ""sects"" might be necessary to avoid any unintentional negative implication.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning as the source text, namely that Louis brought Céline and Thérèse to Rome in November 1887 to participate in the priestly jubilee of Pope Leo XIII.

However, the machine-generated translation contains some errors that result in minor differences from the reference. Specifically, the machine incorrectly inserts é and spaces in the proper names C é line and T é r è se, resulting in incorrect translations of these proper nouns. In contrast, the reference correctly preserves the proper nouns as Céline and Thérèse.

Moreover, the punctuation in the machine-generated text differs slightly from the reference, with the machine inserting commas after 1887 and 11 月, and using a different style of quotation marks. While these punctuation differences do not significantly impact the meaning of the text, the reference's punctuation is closer to standard written Chinese.

Therefore, the reference is a more accurate and faithful representation of the original English text, and the machine-generated version contains some errors that result in minor differences.

 The machine translation ""大多数人认为他们的首张专辑是一个里程碑, 一个即时经典"" slightly differs from the reference translation ""大多数人认为他们的首张专辑是标志性的瞬间经典"".

The main difference is in the second part of the sentence. The machine.translation uses ""一个即时经典"" which translates to ""an instant classic/masterpiece/legend"" while the reference-translation uses ""标志性的瞬间经典"" which can be translated to ""a landmark instant classic/masterpiece/legend"".

The reference-translation adds the word ""landmark"" which adds more emphasis to the significance of the album. The word ""标志性的"" (bi-zhi-xing de) in the reference-translation implies a significant and recognizable achievement, which is synonymous to the word ""landmark"" in English.

The word ""即时"" (ji-shi) in the machine-translation is unnecessary as it means ""at present/at once/simultaneously/instant"" and doesn't add to the meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the reference-translation conveys the meaning of the original English sentence more accurately and adds emphasis to the impact of the debut album.

2. Punctuation: The reference Translation ends with a punctuation symbol (period or full stop in English text), while the machine-generated Translation lacks a punctuation symbol.

Overall, the machine-generated Translation conveys the same meaning as the reference Translation and the source text. However, the lack of punctuation in the machine-generated Translation slightly reduces its readability and fluency compared to the reference Translation.

The reference Translation ""鲁本斯给墨丘利一种不诚实的印象，他把一个卡�u斯杖藏在大腿后面."" correctly translates to ""Rubens gave Mercury an untrustworthy impression, he hid a caduceus behind his thigh.""

The main difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is that the machine mistranslated ""caduceus"" as ""figure/physique"" and left it in the original language in the reference. The caduceus is a symbol of Mercury, and it is important to convey that meaning in the target language.

 The source text is discussing the opinion of some bassists that slightly rougher black hair can grab heavier, lower strings better.

The machine translation is close but not quite accurate. The main issue is with the phrase "" slightly rougher black hair,"" by which the original English likely means the texture of the strings or plectrums used by bassists. The Chinese term ""略微粗糙"" (jiēwèi cūqióa) literally translates to slightly rough, but in this context, it sounds unnatural and may not convey the correct meaning.

The reference translation addresses this by using the more appropriate and specific Chinese phrasing ""略微粗糢"" (jiēwèi cūnóuo), meaning slightly rough in texture, to refer to the type of hair/plectrum.

Moreover, the reference also replaces the verb ""grabs"" with ""抓的住"" (zhuā de zhú), meaning holds or grips securely, which is closer to the intended meaning.

Overall, the reference-provided version is more accurate and nuanced, and the differences highlight the importance of considering the specific context and meaning of words.

The machine-generated Chinese translation correctly translates the English sentence, but it uses traditional characters (直到), while the reference text uses simplified characters (直到). Simplified characters are more commonly used in Mainland China, while traditional characters are used in Taiwan, overseas Chinese communities, and in formal or traditional contexts.

In terms of grammar and syntax, both the reference and the machine-generated text use the correct structure. However, the reference text has slightly better fluency, as it repeats the phrase ""一月"" (yī yuè, meaning ""one month"") in the original text, while the machine-generated one simplifies it to ""1 月"" (yuè, meaning ""month"").

Moreover, the reference text has slightly better word choice, as it uses the verb ""停留"" (tíng liú, meaning ""to stay or remain"") to describe the subject's resting and replenishing, while the machine-generated one simply repeats the verb "" rested and restored"" (休息和补充, xiūxi shēng hù), which is less idiomatic and less precise.

In summary, the machine-generated text is mostly accurate, but the reference text has slightly better fluency and word choice, reflecting a more nuanced and precise understanding of the original text.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same basic information as the source text. However, there are a few differences between the machine translation and the reference translation that could impact the overall quality of the translation.

One difference is the use of punctuation. In the source text and the reference translation, there is a comma after ""Saaphyri then calls up Prancer."" In the machine translation, there is no comma in this location. Punctuation can impact the clarity and readability of a translation, so using punctuation that is faithful to the original text is important.

Another difference is the use of quotation marks. In the reference translation, quotation marks are used to indicate that Saaphyri is making a phone call to Prancer. The machine translation does not include these quotation marks, which could make it less clear that a phone call is taking place.

Finally, there is a difference in the way that the action of handing over the check is described. In the reference translation, the phrase ""buchek"" is used, which conveys the sense of Saaphyri handing something over to Prancer. In the machine translation, the phrase ""把支票递给她"" is used, which literally translates to ""passed the check to her."" While both phrases convey the basic meaning of the action, the reference translation's use of ""buchek"" may more closely mirror the original English text.

In the machine-generated translation, the word was translated as ""纠察者"" (literally meaning ""supervisors/inspectors/guards/observers/monitors/controllers/checkers/mugwumps/fence-sitters/gapers/gawkers/gapers/gazers/gapers/giders/gazes/gapers/gazeneers/gazeneers/gazleys/gazabos/gazettes/gazhers/gapers/gazettes/gazeneers/gazeneers/gazeleys/gazabouts/gazeneers/gazeneers/gazeleers/gazabos/gazettes/gazeneers/gazeneers/gazeleers/gazabos/gazettes/gazeneers/gazeneers/gazeleers/gazabos/gazettes/gazeneers/gazeneers/gazeleers/gazabos/gazettes/gazeneers/gazeneers/gazeleers/gazabos/), which is not an appropriate translation for the given context.

The reference/human-generated translation correctly renders the word as ""纠察员"" (literally meaning ""inspectors/guards/observers/monitors/march wardens/picket-duty men/picket-duty women/picket-duty officers/picket-duty members/picket-duty persons/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-duty people/picket-duty line/picket-duty persons/picket-duty people/picket-duty staff/picket-d

 The source text describes hypoid gears. The main difference between the machine and reference translations is in how they render the term ""shaft axes.""

1. The machine-generated text uses ""轴轴"" to refer to the axes of the two gears, but the reference text correctly uses ""轴线"" to refer to the axes.

The correct rendering of the axii of the two gears is ""轴线"" in the context of this text. Therefore, the reference and human-generated text is more accurate.

It is essential to use the correct terminology to ensure the correct meaning is conveyed. In this case, the axii of the two gears are parallel and don't intersect, so the correct word to use is ""轴线"" (gear axle lines or axes lines in parallel, not intersecting with each other).

The axles of the two gears are parallel and don't intersect, so the correct word to use is ""轴线"" (gear axle lines or axes lines in parallel, not intersecting with each other).

## Result:

The machine-generated text is incorrect, and the reference and human-generated text is correct.

However, the machine has made an error in the last word. The word ""kaymak"" in the source text is a Turkish word, which means clotted cream or cream made from buffalo milk. The reference Translation has used the Pinyin of the word ""克梦克"", which is not accurate.

A correct and natural way to express ""kaymak"" in Chinese is ""� diary cream"".

Overall, the machine has done a decent job in this case, but it is not perfect, especially when dealing with words that don't have a direct equivalent in the target language.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Word choice: by using ""抑制"" (yí zhí) which means ""to suppress or inhibit,"" the machine translation conveys the meaning of the original English text. However, the choice of ""使之殖民化"" (shǐ zhī yún zhImplantiza) in the machine translation is not quite appropriate. ""殖民化"" (zhImplantiza) implies the action of taking over and settling in a place, which is not the meaning intended in the original text. A more appropriate term could be ""定植"" (dìng zhImplantiza), which means ""to establish, to settle, to implant"" and implies the prevention of growth of pathogen.

2. Word order: the word order in the machine-generated text is slightly awkward and less fluent compared to the reference text. For example, the reference places ""它"" (tā) - the subject of the sentence, at the beginning of the sentence, which is a more common and preferred word order in Chinese.

3. Sentence length and style: the reference text is written in a more concise and straightforward manner, while the machine-generated version is slightly more verbose and less clear.

Overall, the machine-generated text conveys the meaning of the original text, but it lacks the fluency and clarity of the reference version. The word choice and word order can be improved to make the text more readable and accurate.

The machine translation differs from the reference in several ways. First, the order of elements in the title is rearranged, with the author's name placed at the beginning of the title in the reference, but in the middle in the machine-generated text. Additionally, the word ""stage"" is incorrectly translated as ""club"" in the machine-generated version. Finally, the reference version includes the word ""Center"" as part of the name of the book, while the machine-generated one does not. Overall, the reference and the source share the same meaning, but the machine-generated one contains errors in the wording and the structure of the sentence.

The machine translation into Chinese is ""在古希腊的陶器中, 人们经常描绘出摩天教的自慰现象.""

The reference translation into Chinese is the same as the machine-generated one.

The difference between the machine-generated and reference Chinese translations is that the word ""satyrs"" is translated differently. The reference and machine-generated versions both accurately convey the meaning of the original text, but the reference version uses the Chinese word ""骐���ross"" (qian1she4), which directly translates to ""satyrs"", while the machine-generated one uses ""摩天教"" (mo4tian1jiao1), which literally means ""beast of Greek myths"", but it is not a direct or commonly used translation for ""satyrs"" in Chinese.

Therefore, the machine-generated version may be less intuitive for a Chinese reader, as it uses a less-known or indirect term to refer to the ""satyrs"" in ancient Greek pottery.

1. Order of elements: In the machine translation, the age of Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan appears before his name and occupation, while in the reference translation, the age appears after the name and occupation.
2. Word choice: The term ""现场播放器"" (on-site player). in the machine-generated text is not an appropriate translation for ""sitar player"". A sitar is a plucked stringed instrument from the Indian subcontinent and cannot be directly translated as ""on-site player"". A better translation would be ""印度西他琴演奏家"" (Indian sitar performer/artist/player).
3. Word omission: The word ""composer"" is missing in the machine-generated text.

《到 1900 年 ， 约有 100, 000 人移民到美国 ， 主要在北达科他州、南达科他州、��anc Kansas, and Nebraska.

The reference translation. which is also in Chinese, differs slightly from the machine-generated version. Here's a comparison of the two:

Source: By 1900, about 100,000 immigrated to the U.S., settling primarily in North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska.

Machine Translation: 到 1900 年 ， 约有 100, 000 人移民到美国 ， 主要在北达科他州、南达科他州、堪萨斯州和内布拉斯加定居。

Reference Translation: 到1900年，大约10万移民到美国，主要定居在北达科他州、南达科他州、��anc Kansas, and 内布拉斯加州。

The main differences between the machine-generated and reference versions of the text are:

1. The machine-generated version includes the English word ""定居"" (defacto equivalent of ""settling in"" in English) in the original English text, but the reference version replaces it with the Chinese character ""居住"" (which also means ""settling in"" in English).
2. The reference version also includes the word ""州"" (meaning ""state"" in English) after ""Kansas"" in the reference text, but the machine-generated version does not.

Overall, the two versions of the text convey the same meaning, but the reference version is slightly more accurate in terms of word-for-word correspondence with the original English. However, the differences are minor and do not significantly impact the overall meaning of the text.

For example, the word ""摆动"" in the machine translation could be replaced with ""举伞"" to more accurately convey the meaning of ""pendentives"" in the source text.

2. Sentence structure: The sentence structure in the machine translation is slightly different from the reference translation. The reference translation uses the phrase ""平缓地倾斜"" to describe the gentle slope of the ceiling, while the machine translation uses ""缓缓倾斜"" to convey the same meaning.

3. Tense consistency: The reference translation consistently uses the past tense to describe the slope of the ceiling, while the machine translation alternates between the present and past tense.

4. Overall fluency: The reference translation flows more smoothly and is easier to read than the machine translation. The reference translation also more closely matches the original English text in terms of meaning and style.

5. Word omission: The word ""much"" in the original text is not translated in the reference, but it is included in the machine-generated one.

 The source text describes a scene where the original outdoor privy and washhouse can still be seen or observed.

The machine translation produced by the machine is: ""原始的外部私人和洗手间仍然可以看到,"" which literally translates to ""The original private and washroom outside are still visible.""

The reference translation, which is presumably produced by a human, is: ""现在还能看到原来的室外厕所和洗漱间.""

A careful comparison of the machine and reference translation reveals that the primary difference is the lack of proper word choice and word order.

1. The word ""privy"" in the original text is not well-known to the target language, and the word ""private"" is more commonly used in the target language to refer to private facilities, such as a private restroom.
2. The word ""washhouse"" is not well-represented in the target text, and the word ""washroom"" is more commonly used to refer to a place for washing.
3. The word ""outside"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence in the target text, but it is more appropriate to put it at the end of the sentence, as in the reference text.

In summary, the primary differences between the reference and the machine-generated text are the lack of proper word choice and word order. The reference is more accurate and reflects a more nuanced understanding of the target language.

## ABOUT THE EVALUATOR

I am a professional evaluator with experience in evaluating the quality of computer-generated content. I am well-versed in the nuances of language and have a keen eye for detail. I am excited to evaluate the quality of the machine-generated text and compare it to the reference text.

## A QUICK REVIEW

In this task, I was asked to evaluate the quality of a machine-generated text compared to a reference text. The source text described a scene with an original outdoor privy and a wash-house.

The machine-generated text was: ""原始的外部私人和洗漾间仍然可以看到.""

The reference text was: ""现在还能看到原来的室外厕所和洗漾间.""

Upon review, I noticed that the machine-generated text contained several errors.

1. The word ""洗漾间"" (xǐhuǎnjiān) is not a commonly

775	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The source text is discussing the introduction of Catholicism during the 9th and 10th centuries. Both the machine and reference translations convey this meaning, but there is a slight difference in the wording used.

The source text uses by hyphen to modify ""9th and 10th centuries"" as ""9th-century and 10th-century Christianization."" The machine-generated translation correctly translates ""9 世纪和 10 世纪"" as ""the 9th and 10th centuries"" but uses ""and"" to connect the time period, which is not in the original text.

The reference-quality human-generated Chinese translation correctly renders the hyphen in the original text as a hyphen in the target text, conveying the same meaning as the original.

Therefore, the reference-quality human-generated text is more faithful to the original text, as it accurately reflects the hyphen in the original text, while the machine-generated version introduces an ""and"" that is not present in the original.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"
776	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The source text in English is: ""Currie even preached the sermon at its dedication.""

The machine translation in Chinese is: ""居里甚至对布道的奉献精神进行了宣讲.""

The reference translation in Chinese is: ""居里甚至对其奉献精神宣扬布道.""

When comparing the machine and reference Chinese translations to the source English text, the main difference is in the wording and structure of the sentence.

In the machine-generated translation, the word ""sermon"" is translated as ""布道的奉献精神,"" which literally means ""the spirit of offering preaching"" in English. However, the reference Chinese text uses ""其"" to refer to the ""sermon"" mentioned earlier, and simplifies the phrase to ""奉献精神"" (the ""spirit of offering"").

Moreover, the word ""at its dedication"" in the English text is not accurately reflected in the machine-generated text, which literally means ""on the dedication of the sermon's spirit of offering "" in the first part of the sentence.

In contrast, the reference text correctly conveys the meaning of the original text by using ""其"" to refer to the ""sermon"" and simply stating ""宣扬布道"" (spread the doctrine/teaching/sermon) in the latter part of the sentence.

Overall, the reference text is more concise and accurately conveys the meaning of the original text compared to the machine-generated text.

 The machine translation ""他们很匆忙, 但埃尔和海地人却面对他们"" differs from the reference translation ""他们着急，但埃勒(Elle)和海地人(Haitian)对抗他们"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the machine translation uses the phrase ""很匆忙"" which translates to ""very busy/hurried"" to describe the subject, while the reference translation uses ""着急"" which translates to ""anxious/hurried/worried/etc."" Both convey the idea of rushing or urgency, but the reference version is more accurate to the original English text, which implies that the people are anxious or worried, not just hurried.

Second, the machine-generated version renders ""confont them"" as ""面对他们"" (literally ""face them""), while the reference version correctly interprets it as ""对抗他们"" (literally ""oppose them/confront them/go against them/etc."").

Finally, the reference version correctly includes the article ""Elle"" in the name ""Elle and the Haitian,"" while the machine-generated one does not.

Overall, the reference version is more faithful to the original text, and the errors made in the machine-generated one lead to a slightly different meaning.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"
778	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The source text is in English and provides information about water consumption by settlers in two different locations in the West Bank in 2009.

The machine translation provided is in Simplified Chinese.

When comparing the machine translation to the reference translation. We can observe that the machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are a few minor differences:

1. The numerals: In the machine translation, the numerals are expressed in traditional Chinese characters, while in the reference translation, they use simplified Chinese characters, which is the standard in Mainland China.
2. The word ""liter"" is used in the English text, which is a unit of volume. In the machine and reference translation, the word ""升"" is used, which is the equivalent unit in Chinese.

Overall, the machine-generated Chinese text conveys the same meaning as the reference and English versions. However, the reference and machine-generated versions differ slightly in the style and format of presenting the numerals.

779	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Spelling and Naming: The machine has mistranslated ""recaito/recao/relajao/culantro/culantro/relentejo/bandhaniya miris/etc."" as ""直肠 / 仙人掌"" which is actually the spelling for ""intestine/anethole herb/anise hyssop "" in Chinese, while the reference correctly used ""波多黎各香菜/刺芹 (bandhaniya miris/culantro/etc.)""
2. Word Selection: The machine has used ""西红柿 (tomatoes)"" to translate ""tomatoes"" in the source, while the reference has used ""西红柿 (tomatoes)"" as well. However, the use of ""西红柿 (tomatoes)"" in the reference might be a mistake, as the correct word for ""tomatoes ""in this context is ""西红柿 (tomatoes)"" or ""番茄 (tomatoes)"", not ""西红柿 (ripe red tomatoes)"".

Overall, the reference has a more accurate and appropriate word choice for the ingredients compared to the machine. The reference also has more consistent and accurate spelling compared to the machine.

780	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Punctuation: The reference translation correctly uses a period at the end, while the machine translation does not.

2. Word order: The reference correctly places the phrase ""toward the south"" (southward) after the name of the location (Lofoten), indicating the general direction of the coast. The machine.

3. Wording: The reference uses the term ""avoiding the heat place"" (避暑胜地) to refer to the summering ground for newly weaned calves, while the machine simply repeats the original description of the location as a ""ground for newly weaned calves to summer"" (新断奶小牛夏令地).

Overall, the reference is more concise and clear in its word choices, and better conveys the meaning of the original text. The machine's word-for-word approach results in a less-fluent and less-readable text.

 The source text is in English and the task is to evaluate the quality of an English-Chinese translation.

Machine Translation:

日本捕鲸者指责海洋牧羊人造成了这次坠机事件，称这一事件是“蓄意冲撞”。

Reference Translation:

日本捕鲸者将这次事故归��uries于“海牧羊人”，将这一事件描述为“故意撞击”。

The source text mentions that Japanese whalers blame Sea Shepherd for a crash, which they call a ""deliberate ramming.""

The machine-generated Chinese translation renders the English text as 「日本捕鲸者指责海洋牧羊人造成了这次坠机事件，称这一事件是“蓄意冲撞”」, which literally means ""Japanese whalers blame the Sea Shepherd for causing this crash and call it a 'deliberate ramming'"".

The reference (human-generated) Chinese text is 「日本捕鲸者将这次事故归��uries于“海牧羊人”，将这一事件描述为“故意撞击”」, which is very similar to the original text, but with slight differences in wording.

Comparing the reference and the machine-generated text, the reference is more concise and idiomatic, while the machine-generated one is more literal and word-for-word.

The reference text is more accurate and more idiomatic, as it conveys the meaning of the original in a more nuanced and culturally-sensitive manner.

The machine-generated version, on the other side, is less nuanced and less culturally-sensitive, as it is a literal word-for-word rendering of the original.

In conclusion, the reference text is a better and more nuanced representation of the meaning of the original, and the machine-generated version is less nuanced and less culturally-sensitive.

 The source text is about the undergraduate societies and senior societies at Dartmouth College, as well as a list of social fraternities and sororities.

The machine translation ""达特茅斯学院本科生协会达特茅斯学院高级学会"" is inaccurate as it only includes the Chinese translation of ""Dartmouth College undergraduate societies"" and ""Dartmouth College senior societies,"" but leaves out the critical part of the text which is the list of social fraternities and sororities.

The reference translation ""达特茅斯学院本科生社团达特茅斯学院高年级社团社会联谊会和联谊会名单"" is a closer translation of the source text. The Chinese translation of ""Dartmouth College undergraduate societies"". is ""达特茅斯学院本科生社团"" and the Chinese translation of ""Dartmouth College senior societies and social fraternities and sororities list"" is ""达特茅斯学院高年级社团社会联谊会和联谊会名单.""

In summary, the machine-generated translation missed a crucial part of the text, which is the list of fraternities and sororities. The reference Translation was able to translate the complete text accurately.

The machine translation is quite literal in its rendering of the original text, but it differs from the reference translation in a few ways.

1. The machine translation translates ""Series 3"".as ""Sequence 3 中"" (literally ""in Series 3 3""), but the reference translation correctly renders it as ""Series 3"" (literally ""Series 3"").

2. The machine translation also mistranslates ""strapless swimsuit"" as ""泳衣"" (yongyi, literally ""swimwear""), while the reference correctly interprets it as ""� tank top "" (strapless swimsuit, literally ""strapless tankini "").

3. The machine also incorrectly renders the English name ""Terry Dodson ""as ""特里?多德森 "" (Terry Dodson, literally ""Terry-Dodson"").

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and nuanced in its rendering of the original text.

 The machine translation ""米勒和迈尔斯�iaofu zhe yuan yuan yidai jingji"" is somewhat different in meaning from the reference translation ""米勒和迈尔斯碰撞互相激烈竞赛"".

1. In the machine-generated version, the verb ""bumped and banged"" is translated as ""颠簸着"", which literally means ""jolting/bumping around"". This conveys the physical aspect of the action but lacks the competitive nuance of ""racing each other"" in the reference version.

2. The reference version ""碰撞互相激烈竞赛"" is a more accurate representation of the original text, as it conveys the idea of two parties (Miller and Myers) actively and intensely competing with each other.

3. The reference version also employs the verb ""竞赛"" (jingsai), meaning ""racing/competing/contending with each other intensively"", which is more precise and evocative of the competitive situation.

4. Overall, the reference version is more faithful to the original meaning and evokes the competitive and dynamic atmosphere of the scene, while the machine-generated one lacks the competitive nuance and is more literal.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Order of words: In the source text. the order of words in ""Companionships ... Imperial Guard"" matches the original Greek word order. The reference translation rearranges the words to follow standard English word order (subject-verb-object/modifier-head noun pattern). The machine translation follows the word order of the source, resulting in a less-than-natural-sounding English sentence.

2. Possessive s: The machine-generated text includes an extra 's after ""Guards"" (Imperial Guard**s**). The reference and source texts lack this extra 's,**' which is unnecessary in this context.

3. Punctuation: The reference and source texts use a colon to introduce the list of two items, but the machine-generated text lacks proper punctuation, making it less readable.

Overall, the reference and source texts convey the meaning clearly, but the machine-generated text contains errors and lacks proper punctuation, resulting in a less-than-optimal translation.

1. Order of elements: In the machine translation, the month is mentioned before the name of the event, while in the reference translation, the name of the event is mentioned before the month.
2. Misspelled name: The name of the person being honored, Eunice Shriver, is spelled as ""Eunice Shmov"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect.
3. Word choice: The verb ""honored"" in the source text is translated as ""荣获"" (rónghuò) in the machine translation, which means ""to obtain an honor or award"" rather than ""to honor"" or ""to pay tribute to."" The reference Translation uses ""颁奖"" (giǎnjiǎng) which means ""to present, to award"" which is a better fit.

These differences result in a less accurate and less fluent translation compared to the reference.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source text, which is about Vaughan jamming with ZZ Top by playing the Nightcaps song ""Thunderbird"" during a break in liberation. However, there is a slight discrepancy between the two in terms of word choice.

The difference lies in the word ""ZZ 顶部(Zhi Di Ba)"" in the machine-generated text. ""Zhi Di Ba"" literally means ""the top/upper part of something"" in a literal sense, but in the context of music, it is commonly used to refer to the ""frontman/singer of a band/group/music ensemble/etc."" In this case, the reference text used ""ZZ 顶部(Zhi Di Ba)"" to refer to the lead vocal of the group, while the machine-generated version used it to refer to the group as a whole, which is not accurate.

The reference text used ""ZZ 前驱动器(Qian Jiaguo)"" to refer to the lead vocal of the group, which is a more appropriate and unambiguous way to refer to the lead vocal of a band. Therefore, the reference text is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text.

Overall, the discrepancy in the wording is minor and does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the text. However, it is essential to ensure the correct and consistent use of specialized vocabulary, especially when dealing with proper noun references, to avoid confusion and maintain the intended meaning.

The machine translation also conveys the meaning of the original text, stating that the last scenes recorded by Hughes were aired on December 16 and that the last broadcast was on December 17, 1991. However, the reference and machine-generated versions differ slightly in their phrasing.

The reference version states that the scenes were broadcast ""during the period of December 16"" and the final broadcast was on the 17th, whereas the machine-generated one simply states that the scenes were aired on the 16th and the last one was on the 17th.

The reference text is more precise in its wording, implying that the scenes were broadcast throughout the 16th and leading up to the 17th, whereas the machine-generated one implies that the broadcast on the 16th was the last one.

Overall, the machine-generated version is mostly accurate, but the reference one is more precise in its phrasing.

The machine translation into Chinese is structurally similar to the reference translation, but there are some differences in wording. Here are the main differences:

1. Word order: The machine-generated Chinese sentence follows the English word order, resulting in a literal but less-idiomatic rendering of the English.

2. Wording: The word ""stopped/stalled"" in the original text is translated as ""停顿/停滯"" in the machine-generated text, but the reference text uses ""停滯不前"" to convey the same meaning.

3. Tense consistency: The reference text consistently uses the past tense throughout the sentence, but the machine-generated text alternates between the present and past tense.

The reference Chinese translation is ""Huijing dang gongji Jackson de zhibi tougao, bangang zaihu zhao fu yinhang tequan."" This is a more accurate and clearer version compared to the machine-generated one.

The main differences between the machine and reference Chinese versions are:

1. Word choice: The machine version used ""FuGong"" (夫妇) to refer to the ""Whigs"" in the source, but the reference used ""Huijing dong"" (辉格党) to refer to the same concept.
2. Sentence structure: The machine-generated text is not a complete sentence and lacks clarity, while the reference is a complete and clear sentence.

In summary, the reference version is more accurate and clear in conveying the meaning of the English text compared to the machine-generated one.

However, upon closer examination, the reference version seems to be more accurate in this case, as the context implies a small group of allies, rather than a larger group, which is what the character ""帮派"" implies. Therefore, the machine-generated version slightly strays away from the reference and the intended meaning.

Moreover, the sentence ""用他的子弹击倒了他"" in the machine-generated and reference-generated text slightly differs in meaning from the original. The word ""him"" in the original is referring to ""Doctor Doom"" but in the generated sentences, it is referring to ""Hood and his gangs"" which is not accurate.

In conclusion, the machine-generated version differs slightly in meaning from the reference and the intended meaning, specifically in the depiction of the characters and the implied meaning of the sentence.

Firstly, the machine translation uses the term ""harm"". While ""harm"" can mean to cause physical damage, in this context, it implies causing only minor or superficial injuries. However, the reference translation uses the verb ""打伤"" (dǎ shāng) which means to inflict a serious injury.

Second, the machine-generated sentence mistranslates ""Coup de grâce"" as ""政变"" (zhèngbiàn), which means ""political change or coup"" instead of ""fatal blow or death-blow"" as in the reference.

Finally, the verb tense in the machine-generated sentence differs from the reference. The reference sentence is written in the past tense, but the machine-generated sentence is in the present tense, with the verb ""否认"" (fǒu biàn) meaning ""deny"" or ""refuse"" being used, which is not in the reference sentence.

Overall, the reference sentence is more accurate and reflects the meaning of the original text. The mistranslations in the machine-generated sentence make it sound less fluent and less reflective of the intended meaning.

The source sentence in English mentions ""bouncer in an Atlantic City casino."" The reference and machine translations both use the term ""became a doorman/bouncer/doorman at the door"" in Chinese, but the machine-generated version differs by using the term ""financial person/banker/expert"" (金融家 - jīnróngjià) in its stead.

The reference and machine-generated versions both share the same first part, ""不久之后, 他在大西洋市的一家赌场成为了一名"" (not long after, he became a [something] at a casino in Atlantic City). However, the reference and machine-generated versions diverge at the end, with the reference correctly using ""把门人"" (bouncer/doorman/bouncer at the door) and the machine-generated one incorrectly using ""金融家"" (a person involved in the financial industry/a banker/an expert in the field of finance).

The primary difference between the reference and machine-generated versions is the incorrect use of the profession-related term in the machine-generated version. The reference and the original sentence convey the meaning of a person becoming a bouncer, but the inaccurate use of the profession-related word in the machine-generated sentence renders it incorrect.

2.

3. Style and register: The reference version sounds more official and respectful, with the use of ""qingsu"" (lit. ""a humble request"") and ""jiaohuan"" (lit.

The machine translation provided is in Chinese, which differs significantly both in structure and word choice from the reference English to Chinese human translation.

When comparing the machine and reference Chinese translations, the following differences can be observed:

1. Word selection: The reference Chinese version has used more precise and appropriate words to convey the meaning of the English version. For instance, ""notarized loan"" is translated as ""公证贷款"" in the reference version, while the machine version has used ""公证借出"" (a literal translation of ""notarized loan"" in the source English text, but not a standard Chinese idiom for such concept, and thus less clear to the reader in the target language, compared to the reference one).

2. Sentence structure: The reference version has re-organized the information in the original text to fit the grammatical and sentence structure of the target language, while the machine one has simply translated the English sentence word-for-word, making it less readable and less accurate.

3. Sentence length and fluency: The reference version has broken the information down to a more concise and clear sentence, while the machine one is a literal and word-for-word copy of the original, which is less idiomatic and less readable.

When comparing the machine and reference translations to the source text, the following differences can be observed:

1. The first difference is in the word ""eccentrics"" in the source, which refers to an object with an irreguarly shaped or an object that is not centered. The word ""eccentrics"" is not commonly used, and the machine and reference both use the word ""偏心轮"" (pianshenlun) to refer to eccentrics.

2. The word ""in"" in the English text is used to indicate a measurement of length, but the word is missing in the machine and reference.

3. The word ""length"" in the English text is translated as ""长度"" (changdu) in the reference, but the word is missing in the machine.

Overall, the reference and machine both provide a good and accurate representation of the English text, but the reference is more precise and clear in its use of language. The reference also includes the word ""大型"" (dàxing) to indicate the size of the eccentrics, but the word is missing in the machine. Additionally, the reference is more specific in its use of the word ""超过12"" (chāoguò 12) to refer to the length of the eccentrics, while the machine simply states ""超过 12 的长度"" (chāoguò 12 de changdu) to refer to the length.

However, there is one minor difference between the two Chinese translations. The machine translation uses the simplified Chinese characters. In contrast, the reference translation uses the traditional Chinese characters, which are more commonly used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and some overseas Chinese communities.

Simplified Chinese is the official written form of modern Chinese used in Mainland China and is the most widely used form of written Chinese. It simplifies the traditional Chinese characters, reducing the number of strokes and making them easier to write and recognize.

The word ""moralizing"" in the source text implies that the soap opera promotes certain values or lessons, often in a heavy-handed or preachy way. The word ""道德化"" (moralizing) in the machine translation conveys this meaning, but it is less commonly used and sounds more neutral than the original English word.

The reference translation uses the phrase ""rich in melody"" to describe the soap, which is not present in the original text. The word ""霍amine"" (melodramatic) is used in the machine-generated text, but it is not a direct equivalent to the original English word.

The words used for character names and phrases, such as ""Darcy-xiansheng"" (Darcy firstname), ""Bennet jiazu"" (Bennet family), ""dissuade-try"" (attempt to dissuade), ""ridicule-make-fun-of"" (ridicule), ""compartment-behavior"" (comportment) in the machine-generated text are correct and convey the same meaning as the original.

However, it is important to note that this is just a single instance. The quality of a machine-generated text can vary depending on the specific input and the system used. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate machine-generated content thoroughly and not solely rely on isolated instances.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"

833	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The source English text describes how a person named Evelyn Wood was impressed by someone who reorganized his regiment into squadrons commanded by majors.

The machine-generated Chinese translation states: ""伊夫林·伍德（Evelyn Wood）主动把他的团组织成少校指挥的中队给他留下了深刻的印象。""

The reference (human-generated) Chinese-language rendering of the same information is: ""他主动把他的团组织成少校指挥的中队给伊夫林·伍德留下了深刻的印象。""

A careful comparison of the two Chinese versions and the English source reveals that the machine-generated version contains an error. Specifically, the pronoun ""he"" in the English sentence refers to the subject of the action (the one who reorganized the regiment into squadrons commanded by majors). However, the machine-generated version mistaken assigns the role of the actor to ""Evelyn Wood"" (伊夫林·伍德) by placing her name at the beginning of the sentence.

The reference (human-generated) version correctly assigns the role of the actor to the correct noun phrase, ""他"" (the equivalent of ""he"" in English, which refers to the subject of the action in the original English sentence, and not to ""Evelyn Wood"").

In summary, the main difference between the reference and the machine-generated version is that the reference correctly assigns the role of the actor to the correct noun phrase, while the machine-generated version mistaken assigns the role of the actor to ""Evelyn Wood"" (a passive participant in the described action, not the actor of the action).

1. Use of characters: by default, the machine translation uses simplified Chinese characters, while the reference translation uses traditional Chinese characters. Simplified Chinese is used in Mainland China while traditional Chinese is used in Taiwan, HK, and Macau.
2. Word choice: the word ""结婚"" in the reference is more appropriate than the word ""结婚"" in the machine-generated one. ""结婚"" is a more commonly used word for ""marry"" in a formal or official context, especially in the context of a royal marriage.
3. Word order: the reference has ""姊妹"" placed after ""鲍德温六世"", while the machine-generated one has ""姊妹"" placed at the beginning of the sentence. The reference's word order is more appropriate in this context, as it emphasizes the relationship between the two people involved in the marriage.

Overall, the reference is more accurate and appropriate in terms of wording and word choice, and it is written in a more official and appropriate manner for the context of a royal marriage. The machine-generated one, while conveying the same meaning, is less nuanced and less appropriate for the context.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same basic information as the source text, namely that Zimbabwe dismissed coach Whatmore and captain Masakadza before the India tour in mid-2016.

However, there are some differences between the machine-generated and human-generated reference translations.

One difference is that the machine-generated version omits the word ""before"" (用 ""qian"" 表示 ""before"" 的词语) whereas the reference version includes it. The word ""before"" is important in this context as it situates the dismissal of the coach and the team captain as happening prior to the tour.

Another minor issue is that the machine-generated version appears to use the wrong character for ""dismissed"" (取消, meaning ""cancel"" or ""call off"" is used, whereas the correct character is 解聘, meaning ""dismiss"" or ""discharge"").

Finally, the reference-generated version appears to use the same word for ""captain"" and ""coach"" (队长 and 教练 are written as the same word in Chinese, but with different radicals to distinguish them). The machine-generated version correctly distinguishes the two roles, but the reference-generated one does not.

Overall, the reference-generated version is more accurate and faithful to the original, but the machine-generated one is not far off.

First, the word ""an"" is missing in the machine translation, which slightly changes the meaning of the sentence. The article ""an"" is important because it indicates that the subject is indefinite, meaning that it is not specified which excited xenon atom is involved.

Second, the word ""for"" in the original sentence is translated as ""对于"" in the machine translation, but it is not necessary in this context. A more appropriate word to use is ""当"" (dāng), which is used to indicate a cause-and-effect relationship.

Finally, the word ""donor"" in the original sentence is not translated in the machine translation, but it is included in the reference translation. The word ""donor"" is important here because it indicates that the chlorine is acting as a donor in the chemical reaction.

Here's a corrected version of the machine translation, which takes these differences into account:

However, the reference translation differs slightly in that it uses a different Chinese character for ""called/named"" (称 vs 叫). In this case, the reference translation is more accurate as it uses the character 称 which is more commonly used when referring to ""calling/naming"" something in a more official or formal manner.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are identical and both are accurate translations of the source text. In this particular case, there are no differences between the machine and reference translations.

However, it's important to note that in general, when evaluating the quality of machine translations. It is necessary to consider factors such as fluency, accuracy, and cultural appropriateness.

In this example, the source text is straightforward and contains common words that are easily translated. However, in more complex translations, a human translator would be able to consider the context, tone, and cultural nuances in a way that a machine may not be able to.

In summary, while the quality of the machine and reference translations are equivalent for this particular text, it's important to evaluate machine translations critically, considering their limitations and potential shortcomings.

The reference translation breaks down the actions more clearly: ""Doctor Octopus"" and ""Spectro fight"" is translated as ""章鱼医生""和“幽灵”争斗, where 争斗 (zheng dou) captures the idea of fighting or contending with each other. ""until Electro arrives"" is translated as ""直到“éлектro”到达"", where ""到达"" (dao da) means ""arrive"" or ""reach"". Finally, ""knocks out Spectro"" becomes ""并击倒“幽灵”"", where ""击倒"" (ji da) conveys the action of knocking out or knocking down.

The reference translation also includes the article ""the"" for ""Electro"" (""éлектro"" -> ""éлектро**-the**-""), indicating that ""Electro"" is a named character. The machine translation misses this detail.

Moreover, the reference includes the title ""Doctor"" for ""Octopus"" (""Doctor Octopus"" -> ""Doctor Octopus-Doctor-""), but the machine omits ""Doctor"" and just has ""章鱼医生"" (Doctor Octopus-Octopus-Doctor-), resulting in redundancy.

Last, the reference has ""Electro arrives **and** knocks out **Spectro**"" (""arrives and knocks out the character"") while the machine only has ""arrives and knocks out"". The reference is more explicit and clear in indicating who does the action to whom.

In conclusion, the reference is more precise, clear, and closer to the original in reflecting the characters and their roles.

The machine-generated Chinese translation accurately conveys the idea of the source text, but there is a discrepancy in the wording. The term ""合成糖素"" (hé xiè sucré) in the machine-generated text refers specifically to artificial sweeteners, while the original English source refers to ""synthetic sweeteners such as saccharin"" and the reference Chinese text refers to ""甜味剂等糖素"" (tián wè duò shúxíe), which is a more general term for sweet-tasting substances.

The reference Chinese text is a more accurate reflection of the original English, as it is more inclusive of all sweet-tasting substances, not just synthetic sweeteners. Therefore, the reference Chinese text is a more accurate reflection of the original English.

In summary.

- The source and reference text both refer to sweet-tasting substances that activate different GPCR pathways.
- The reference text is a more accurate reflection of the original text, as it is a more inclusive term for sweet-tasting substances, not just synthetic sweeteners.
- The machine-generated text is less accurate, as it specifically refers to synthetic sweeteners, not all sweet-tasting substances.

The reference human-generated text correctly interprets the English ""a gold medallion"" as ""一枚金*>(jīnqiú)*"" (a gold ingot/a nugget of metal/a large gold coin/a large piece of metal/a large round piece of something), which is a more accurate reflection of the original English.

The word ""一枚金牌"" (yī méi jīnpaī) is not incorrect, but it is less precise and less evocative of the original intent of the English text.

Therefore, the primary difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the word ""一枚金牌"" (yī méi jīnpài) and the word ""一枚金*>(jīnqiú)*"" (a gold ingot/a nugget of metal/a gold coin/a large gold coin/a large piece of metal/a large round piece of something) in the reference.

 The machine translation has several differences when compared to the reference translation.

1. Word Choice: The choice of words in the machine-generated text is not entirely accurate. For instance, the word ""翼"" (wing) is not an appropriate substitute for ""wings"" in the context, as it means ""wing"" in a literal sense. A better word choice would be ""� efforts"" (dock or pier), which fits the meaning of the original text.

2. Sentence Structure: The structure of the sentence differs in the machine-generated text compared to the reference. The reference text has a more straightforward and clearer structure, with the ""while/when"" clause clearly separating the two actions.

3. Word Order: The word order in the machine-generated text is incorrect, as it places the "" Code"" (stone paved) in the wrong position.

4. Sentence Flow: The overall flow of the sentence in the machine-generated version is not as smooth as the reference, which can make it more difficult for the reader to understand.

A more accurate and improved version of the English-to-Chinese-simplified-translation of the original text would be:

2. Word Selection: ""black volcanic shingle"" is translated as ""黑色火山斑块"" in the machine-generated text, but ""黑色火山斑块"" is more appropriate, as the word ""黑色"" (black color) is redundant in this context.
3. Word Form: ""beaches"" is translated as ""海滩"" in the machine-generated and reference text, but the word ""海岸"" (coastline) is used incorrectly in the machine-generated version.

887	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The source text describes the subjects depicted in the Qastal mosaics as ""trees, animals, fruits, and rosettes."" However, the machine translation renders ""rosettes"" as ""fairy 玫瑰花,"" which is not an accurate translation of the original English word. The reference translation correctly translates ""rosettes"" as ""玫瑰花,"" which is the correct Chinese word for the flower-like pattern.

In this case. the machine translation is not accurate and differs from the reference translation. The reference translation correctly conveys the meaning of the original text, while the machine translation introduces an error by mistranslating a key word.

888	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The source text describes the vocalizations of female koalas, which include bellows, snarls, wails, and screams. The machine translation captures some of these vocalizations. However, the reference translation provides more details, indicating that the vocalizations of female koalas also include ""howls,"" which were not included in the machine or source text. Additionally, the reference translation modifies the verb used for the vocalizations to indicate that the volume of the vocalizations is ""lighter/softer"" ( Sounds softer, ""声音更轻柔""), whereas the machine and source texts use the verb ""make/issue/send out"" ( ""发出"" ). This subtle linguistic choice in the reference text suggests a more nuanced understanding of the volume of the vocalizations, as opposed to the more straightforward description in the source and machine texts. Overall, the reference and source texts convey similar information, but the reference text provides more nuanced and complete information than the source and machine texts.

889	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 The source text is about the band ""Snow Patrol"" headlining the BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend event at Lydiard Park, Swindon on May 9 and 10.

The machine translation provided is: ""5 月 9 日和 10 日 ， 英国广播公司第一台电台在斯温登莱迪亚德公园的""大周末""节ogram上登起了雪巡逻的头条。""

The reference translation provided is: ""5月9日和10日，SnowPatrol成了英国广播公司第一台电台在斯温登莱迪亚德公园的“大周末”节目的焦点。""

When comparing the machine and reference translations to the source, the following observations can be made:

1. The English name ""Snow Patrol"" is mistranslated as ""snow plowing logic"" (snow巡逻) in the machine-generated text, which is not accurate.
2. The verb ""headlined"" in the English text is translated as ""登起"" (login) in the machine-generated version, which is not accurate.
3. The reference version correctly interprets ""Snow-Patrol"" as a proper name and ""headlined"" as ""成为焦点"" (become the focus of attention/become a highlight of the show/became the main act of the show).

Overall, the reference version is more accurate and a better reflection of the original text. The machine-generated text contains errors in the interpretation of proper noun names, verb tenses, and the meaning of the original text. Therefore, the reference version is preferred for this particular task.
