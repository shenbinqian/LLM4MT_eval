 When comparing the machine translation. ""Mehul benimmt sich wie ein cooler Kerl und alle Mädels drängen ihn."" to the reference translation ""Mehul benimmt sich wie ein cooler Kerl und alle Mädels drängen sich **ihm** auf."" the difference lies in the word ""him.""

In the reference translation, the word ""ihm"" which means ""him"" is correctly placed at the end of the sentence, indicating that the girls are thronging towards him. However, the machine-generated version lacks this detail and simply states that the girls are thronging him, without specifying the direction.

Overall, the machine-generated version is understandable, but the reference version provides more precise and clear information.

El único error que se puede atribuir al sistema de traducción automática es el uso incorrecto de minúsculas para ""Brigade"" (Brigada) ya que, según las normas ortográficas alemanas, el inicio de una palabra compuesta debe escribirse con mayúscula.

Si bien no hay diferencias sustanciales entre ambas traducciones, el sistema de referencia demuestra una mayor fidelidad al cumplimiento de las reglas ortográficas alemandas.

 Both the source text and the reference translation are in German, and they are identical, with the original German text stating: ""Wie der Chronist Fulcher von Chartres um 1124 schrieb.""

The machine-generated text matches the reference perfectly, and it accurately conveys the meaning of the original text. Therefore, it is not possible to compare the machine-generated text to the reference in this instance, as the two are identical.

However. it is worth noting that the quality of the machine-generated text is dependent on the accuracy of the underlying machine learning algorithms and the data sets used to develop them. In some cases, the quality of the generated text may not be as high, and it is important to carefully evaluate the output of any machine-generated content to ensure its accuracy and fitness for the intended use.

 The machine translation ""Sie plädierten für schuldig, das Bundesgesetz über gefährdete Arities zu verletzen"" is different from the reference translation ""Sie bekannte sich schuldig, gegen das Bundesgesetz über gefährdete Arten verstoßen zu haben.""

One key difference is that the machine..

translation uses ""plädierten für schuldig"" which means ""pleaded guilty"" while the reference.

translation uses ""bekannte sich schuldig"" which also means ""pleaded guilty"".

However, the correct and more appropriate verb tense to use in this context is ""bekannte sich schuldig"" as it conveys the completed action of admitting guilt.

Furthermore, the phrase ""das Bundesgesetz über gefährdete Arten zu verletzen"" in the machine.

translation is not accurate as it translates to ""violating the Federal Law of Endagered Species "" while the reference.

translation correctly conveys the meaning as ""to have violated the Federal Law of Endagered Species"".

Overall, the reference.

translation is more accurate and natural-sounding in conveying the meaning of the original English text.

 In this case, both the machine and reference translations produce the same result: ""Vickie apologizes to Lew for her blackmail attempt."" The source and target languages in the given context are English and German, respectively.

The source text ""Vickie apologizes to Lew for her blackmail attempt"" conveys the idea of an individual named 'Vickie' expressing regret for an inappropriate action, specifically a ""blackmail attempt"" towards 'Lew.'

The provided machine and reference German translations, ""Vickie entschuldigt sich bei Lev für ihren Erpressungsversuch,"" accurately reflect the meaning of the English text.

- ""entschuldigt sich"" (apologizes) corresponds to the English word ""apologizes""
- ""bei"" (to) is consistent with the word ""to"" in the original text
- ""Lew"" is maintained in the target text
- ""für ihren Erpressungsversuch"" (for her blackmail attempt) is equivalent to the original ""blackmail attempt""

Thus, the provided source, reference, and machine-generated text all convey the same meaning. The difference in the wording is due to linguistic nuances and grammatical rules between the languages.

A comparison of the reference and machine-generated text shows that the machine-generated is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences.

1. Word-ordering: The word-ordering in the machine-generated is slightly different from the reference, but it does not affect the meaning of the text.
2. Punctuation: The punctuation in the machine-generated is also slightly different, with the lack of a space after the first word ""hat"" and the omission of the full-stop at the end.

In summary, the machine-generated is mostly accurate, but the minor differences in word-

ord

ing and punctuation make it slightly less clear and natural-sounding than the reference.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same basic information, but there is a subtle difference in how they express the completion of Rich Hill's streak.

The source text states that Rich Hill ended his ""10+ strikeout streak at three,"" which means that his streak of having 10 or more strikeouts in a game ended in a game where he gave up two runs and recorded three strikeouts.

The machine translation renders this as ""Rich Hill gab zwei Läufe auf und beendete seine 10 + Strikeout-Serie mit drei,"" which literally translates to ""Rich Hill allowed two runs and ended his 10 + Strikeout-Series with three.""

The reference translation, on the other hand, renders the same sentence as ""Rich Hill gab zwei Runs auf und beendete seine 10 + Strikeout-Serie bei drei,"" which literally means ""Rich Hill allowed two runs and ended his 10 + Strikeout-Series at three.""

The key difference here is the usage of the word ""at three"" versus ""at three"" in the reference translation. The word ""at three"" implies that the 10+ strikeout series ended specifically in the third game, whereas the word ""with three"" simply implies that the 10+ strikeout series ended in a game where he recorded three strikeouts.

While the distinction may seem minor, the use of ""at three"" in the reference translation is more precise and accurately reflects the meaning of the original text. Therefore, the reference translation is to be preferred in this case.

2. Description of the cargo: The machine and reference Translation both mention the cargo as ""Medikamente und Arzneimittel"" (medicines and medicines), but the redundancy in the machine Translation is unnecessary.

 The source text is in English and describes the Tenth Doctor's discomfort at the Fifth Doctor's fashion choice of wearing celery on his lapel.

The machine translation provided is in German and translates to ""The tenth doctor scratched before the choice of his fifth self, celery on his reverses to wear.""

The reference translation also in German translates to ""The tenth doctor was horrified at the choice of his fifth self, to wear celery on his lapel.""

Comparing the machine and reference translations, the primary difference is that the machine version uses the verb ""kratzte"" which translates to ""scratched"" while the reference version uses ""war erstaunt"" which translates to ""was horrified/astonished/astonished/astounded/dumbfounded/flabbergasted/stunned/dazed/dazed/gobsmacked/shocked/slack-jawed/staggered/ thunderstruck/astonied/dazedly/abas IC/abashed/abstrused/abdazed/astound-ed/bewildered/astoniedly.""

The reference version conveys the Doctor's disapproval and shock at the fashion choice, while the machine version conveys a less intense reaction with the verb ""kratzte"" (scratched).

Moreover, the reference version is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the English word ""cringed"" with ""war erstaunt"" (was horrified/astonished/...), the machine version uses a literal translation of ""kratzte vor der Wahl"" (scratched before the choice) that does not convey the meaning of the original sentence.

Therefore, the reference version is more accurate and natural-sounding in expressing the meaning of the original English sentence.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Article usage: by omitting the article ""das"".
2. Word order: in the English source text, the phrase ""rough homespun and brown scapular"" is hyphenated, indicating that it is a single item of clothing. However, in the machine translation, the words ""groben Homespun"" and ""braunen Scapular"" are separated, which could imply that ""groben"" and ""braunen"" describe different items of clothing.
3. Punctuation: the reference translation includes commas between each item of clothing, while the machine translation does not.

Here is a corrected version of the machine-generated text:

""Von da an trug sie das ""grobe, selbstgemachte und braune Skapulier, weiße Wimple und Schleier, Ledergürtel mit Rosenkranz, Wollstrümpfe, Seilslipper"".""

(Note: I assumed the word ""sandals"" should be ""slippers/slippers/sandals/shoes with ropes/straps/laces/strings"" and chose ""Slipper/slippers/sandals/shoes with ropes/straps/laces/strings"" as ""Sandalen"" can mean all of those depending on the context.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning as the source text, which is that the Dartmouth chapter separated or dissociated itself from the national fraternity in 1987.

However, there is a slight difference in the wording of the two translations. The machine-generated translation uses the verb ""distanzieren"" to convey the idea of dissociation or distancing, while the reference translation uses ""trennen"" for separation.

While both translations are grammatically correct, the reference translation may be a more accurate reflection of the original English sentence. The use of ""trennen"" emphasizes the deliberate and definitive nature of the separation, whereas ""distanzieren"" could potentially be interpreted as a more temporary or passive action.

Overall, the difference in this case is relatively minor, and both machine and reference translations could be considered acceptable depending on the intended meaning and context. However, it is important to carefully consider the nuances of language when evaluating translation quality, as even small differences in wording can impact the overall meaning and tone of a text.

 The machine translation/German version ""Die meisten der überlebenden Elektronen und Positronen löschten sich gegenseitig aus, indtzndie Gammastrahlung freisetzten, die das Universum kurz wieder erhitzte."" is quite similar to the reference/human translation ""Die meisten der überlebenden Elektronen und Positronen vernichteten sich gegenseitig and setzten Gammastrahlung frei, die das Universum kurzzeitig wieder erwärmte.""

However, there is one slight but significant difference:

- ""löschten sich gegenseitig aus, indem sie Gammastrahlung freisetzten, die das Universum kurz wieder erhitzte."" (the electrons and positrons annulled each other, releasing gamma radiation, which briefly reheated the universe)

- ""ver nichteten sich gegenseitig and setzten Gammastrahlung frei, die das Universum kurzzeitig wieder erwärmte."" (the electrons and positron annihilated each other, releasing gamma radiation, which briefly re-warmed the universe)

The word ""löschten sich gegenseitig aus"" (literally ""ex--tinguished themselves"") is not quite accurate in the context of the original sentence, as it implies that the electrons and positrons disappear completely, while ""vernichteten sich gegenseitig"" (literally ""annihilated themselves"") is more accurate, as it implies that the electrons and positrons destroy each other, releasing energy in the form of gamma radiation.

The word ""wieder"" in ""wieder erhitzte"" is also unnecessary, as ""erhitzen"" already implies that the action is repeated, and ""wieder"" is used to emphasize that the heating is temporary.

Overall, the reference/human version is more accurate and clear in its meaning, but the machine version is still understandable and conveys the main idea.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are quite close to the original English source, but upon closer examination, there is one difference between the two.

The machine translation correctly translates ""inherited"" as ""erbte"" and ""hostilities"" as ""Feindseligkeiten"". However, it differs slightly in the wording of the object of the preposition ""against"" in the original English sentence.

The reference translation translates the object of the preposition more literally as ""against the Sassanid Empire"", whereas the machine-generated version renders it as ""against the Sassanidenreich"".

The word ""Reich"" means ""empire"" in English, so the reference and machine-generated versions both convey the same meaning. However, the reference version is more faithful to the original wording, as it maintains the original term ""Empire"" in the target language, whereas the machine-generated one substitutes a synonymous word.

Therefore, the reference version slightly better conveys the meaning of the original sentence, but the difference in meaning between the reference and the machine-generated is minimal.

 The source text states that TG4 (most likely a television channel. ""TG4"" is not a common abbreviation in German, so it is assumed that it refers to the English original) broadcast their first supernatural thriller on 13 January 2010.

The machine-generated translation correctly conveys the meaning of the original sentence, but uses the wrong pronoun in German. The reference (human) translation confirms this, as it correctly uses ""seinen"" (his/her) in reference to TG4.

The difference is subtle, but important. In the source, the subject is ""TG4"" and the object is ""their first supernatural thriller"". In the machine-generated version, the subject is still ""TG4"" but the object is ""seinen ersten übernatürlichen Thriller aus"". The reference-human version correctly uses ""seinen"" to refer to the gender-neutral ""TG4"".

The correct, reference-human, version is: ""TG4 sendete am 13. Januar 2010 seinen ersten übernatürlichen Thriller aus.""

The error in the machine-generated version is subtle, but it is still an error. The difference is in the gender of the pronoun, and it is important to use the correct pronoun to refer to the antecedent. The antecedent in this case is ""TG4"" and the pronoun referring to it is ""seinen"". The gender of the pronoun is determined by the gender of the antecedent, and in this case, the antecedent is a proper name, so the gender of the pronoun is masculine singular.

The error in the machine-generated version is a common one, and it is a result of the limitations of the current NMT (Neural Machine Translation) technology. The system is not able to infer the gender of the antecedent, and it is not able to use the correct pronoun in the target language.

In the machine translation, ""und ihre Mitmenschen"" is placed after ""sie"" (her), while in the reference translation, it is placed after ""sie und"" (around her and).

A more accurate and idiomatic rendering of the English sentence in German would be:

 reference: ""Sie kann um sich und ihre Mitmenschen Mysticons einen rosa orbikulären Schild errichten.""

So, the machine's rendering is not far off, but the reference version places emphasis on ""sie und ihre Mitmenschen"" being together, enclosed in parentheses, which is not reflected in the machine's version.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original English source text, which is unsurprising given their identical wording. However, upon closer examination.

* The definite article ""the"" is missing from the German translation for ""Prälaten"" in the machine-generated version.

The correct form of the machine-generated sentence, which matches the reference, is:

""Um die öffentliche Ordnung wiederherzustellen, versammelten die **deren** Prälaten 1277 die Barone und Delegierten der Adligen und Kumanen zu einer Generalversammlung in der Nähe von Pest.""

The article ""deren"" (genitive, plural, masculine or neuter) is used to indicate possession, referring to the prelates. This subtlety was missed in the original machine-generated sentence.

Apart from that, the two German sentences convey the same meaning as the English original.

 A close comparison of the machine translation. ""Das Sieb findet das Reliquiar in Ullesthorpe, wo die Brigaden es abwarfen, und trägt es in Sicherheit in Huncote, der Heimat des Earl of Leicester,"" with the reference translation reveals no significant differences in meaning or fluency. Both translations accurately convey the original English sentence, ""The reeve finds the reliquary in Ullesthorpe, where the brigands dumped it, and carries it to safety at Huncote, home of the Earl of Leicester.""

However, it's worth noting that the word ""brigands"" was translated as ""Brigaden"" in the machine and reference translation, but ""Brigaden"" actually means ""brigades"" in German. A more accurate translation of ""brigands"" in this context might be ""Raubtiere"" or ""Raubgesindel"". Nevertheless, the overall meaning of the sentence remains clear and accurate in the given machine and reference translation.

23	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-German translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close in their wording. The only difference is that the article ""die"" is present before ""Jugend"" in the reference translation, whereas it is missing in the machine translation.

A more accurate machine-generated English-to-German translation of the source text should be: ""Wahrnehmung von Mobbing und assoziiertem Trauma während der Jugend.""

The article ""die"" is often dropped in spoken and informal written language, but it is usually included in more official or written texts. Therefore, the reference and machine-generated versions differ slightly in their level of formalness. However, it is worth noting that the reference version is more appropriate for written academic texts, while the machine-generated one is closer to spoken language.

In summary, the difference between the reference and the machine-generated version is the article ""die"" in the reference version, which is missing in the machine-generated one. The reference is more suitable for a more official context, while the machine-generated one is more akin to everyday spoken language.

24	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-German translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine and reference translations convey the source text's meaning relatively accurately. However, there is a difference in how they structure the sentence.
The machine and reference both translate ""Jesus"" correctly. The German word for ""preaches"".is accurately translated as ""predigt"" in both versions.

However, the main difference between the two translations is the word order. The reference version separates the description of Jesus as ""Rabbi"" with commas, making it a non-restrictive relative clause. The machine version integrates ""als Rabbiner bezeichnet"" (referred to as ""Rabbi"") into the main clause, making it a restrictive relative clause.

A possible improvement for the machine-generated sentence would be: ""Jesus wird oft als 'Rabbi' bezeichnet und predigt mündlich seine Botschaft."" (Jesus is often referred to as ""Rabbi"" and preaches his message orally.)

In this corrected sentence, the meaning of the reference and the source stay the same, but the word order is aligned with the reference and the original sentence.

25	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-German translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine translation and the reference translation accurately convey the meaning of the original English source text. However, there are a few differences between the two that may be worth pointing out.

One difference is the use of punctuation. In the reference translation, each action thatHarry takes is set off by a comma, whereas the machine translation runs all three actions together. While this is not a major difference in meaning, it can make the sentence flow better in German to include the commas.

Another difference is in the wording of the first action. The reference translation uses the verb ""fashioned"". The verb ""fashioned"" implies that the object being made is being made into a new shape or form. However, the verb ""formed"" in the machine translation implies that the object already has a specific form and is simply being created. In this context, the reference's use of ""fashioned"" is more appropriate, as the original English text implies that the pigeons are being made into something new (a necklace).

Finally, the reference also includes the word ""mit"" (with) in the last clause, which is not present in the machine's version. While the meaning of the sentence is still clear in the machine's version, including ""mit"" is more idiomatic in this context and is a more literal translation of the original English.

Overall, the reference's version of the sentence is more nuanced and more accurately reflects the intended meaning of the original text. However, the machine's version is still readable and conveys the main ideas of the sentence.

* The preposition ""an"" in the machine translation (""an Kundgebung"") is correct in meaning but sounds a bit more awkward than the reference version, which uses ""an einer Kundgebung.""

Here's a more polished version of the English reference text translated to German:

Dieses Mal hielt Paisley eine Ansprache bei einer Kundgebung der ""Dritten Kraft"" in Newtownards vor Tausenden maskierten und einheitlich gekleideten Männern.

1. Vocabulary:
The word ""vigilante"" was mistranslated as ""Wachsamkeit"" (which means ""vigilance, alertness, wakefulness, etc."") in the machine-generated text, while the reference text has ""einen Bürgerwehr"" (which means ""a vigilante, a member of a citizens' posse, a neighborhood watch group, etc."").

 When comparing the machine and reference translations. We can observe that the machine version uses ""zum Tsili Tsili Flugplatz"" (to Tsili Tsili airfield) while the reference version uses ""zum Tsili-Tsili-Flugplatz"" (to the Tsili-Tsili-airfield/airfield).

The reference version has a hyphen in ""Tsili-Tsili-Flugplatz"" but the machine version does not. The hyphen is used to separate the words in a compound noun, as is the case in German. The hyphen is missing in the machine version, which can make the reading less fluent and lead to confusion.

Moreover, the reference version has used a lowercase ""f"" in ""flugplatz"" (airfield) while the machine one has used a capital ""F"". In this context, the use of a lower-case ""f"" is correct, as it is not at the beginning of a sentence.

In summary, the main difference between the reference and the machine version is the lack of a hyphen and the incorrect use of a lower-case/upper-case ""F"" in the machine-generated text. The reference is more accurate and readable.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source text, which is about other recruits resenting Jon's aura of superiority, but he makes amends by helping them master swordplay. However, there are some differences between the two translations.

The main difference is in the verb tenses used. The machine... der Translation uses ""macht Abhilfe,"" which means ""makes amends"" in the present tense, while the reference Translation uses ""macht es wieder gut,"" which means ""makes it right"" or ""makes amends"" in the past tense. The use of the past tense in the reference Translation is more consistent with the context of the original English text, which implies that Jon has already made amends by helping the other recruits master swordplay.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there is a small difference in the way the adjective ""Crassulacean"" is translated. In the reference translation, the adjective is integrated into the name of the process ""Crassulacean Acid Metabolism"" by using a hyphen to link the two words. However, in the machine translation, ""Crassulacean Säure Stoffwechsel"" is translated as if it were two separate terms rather than a hyphenated name for a specific process.

In the machine translation, there is a comma after ""11. September 1973"" whereas in the reference translation, there is no punctuation after that date.

When comparing the two translations, it is important to consider the context and meaning of the sentence. In this particular case, the meaning of the sentence remains the same regardless of whether or not there is punctuation after the year.

Overall, the machine-generated and reference translations accurately reflect the meaning of the original text, and the minor punctuation difference is unlikely to cause confusion or affect comprehension. Therefore, the quality of the English-G german translation provided by the machine is good.

 The difference between the machine translation ""Kansas verlor seinen fünften Kongressbezirk, um umzuteilen"" and the reference translation ""Kansas verlor seinen fünften Kongressbezirk durch Neuverteilung"" lies in the verb used to describe the process of reapportionment.

In the machine translation, the verb ""umzuteilen"" is used, which means ""to divide, distribute or allocate"" in a more general sense. However, the reference translation uses the verb ""durch Neuverteilung"", which specifically refers to the process of re-allocation or re-distribution in the context of political representation.

The use of ""durch Neuverteilung"" in the reference translation is more precise and accurately reflects the intent of the original English sentence, which refers to the loss of a Congressional district due to re-apportionment based on population changes. Therefore, the reference translation is a more accurate reflection of the original English sentence than the machine-generated one.

However, there is one difference between the two translations. by ""somalischer Politiker"" in the machine translation, whereas the reference translation uses ""somalischer Politiker.""

This discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the machine learning algorithms used in the machine-translation system are not sophisticated enough to recognize that the adjective ""Somali"" should not be capitalized in this context.

Overall, the difference in this particular instance is minor and does not significantly impact the meaning of the text. However, it highlights the importance of careful editing and proofreading when using machine-translation tools, as automated systems can sometimes make errors or omissions that require manual correction.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source text, which is that British statesman Edmund Burke, being a supporter of the British Whig party. did not want to see the re-establishment of an absolute monarchy in France after the defeat of Jacobinism.

However, there is a slight but significant difference between the machine and reference translations. The word ""ausrottung"" in the reference German translation means ""eradication"" or ""extremination"", whereas the word ""extirpation"" in the source English text is closer in meaning to ""uprooting"" or ""rooting out"" (a less radical removal of something than extermination or extermination, which connote total elimination or destruction of something).

The word ""ausrotten"" is a possible but less precise and more extreme choice of words in this context, as it implies a more violent and radical removal of something, whereas ""entwurzlen"" or ""entfernen"" might be more appropriate for the context of removing a political ideology.

Moreover, the reference translation also includes the word ""in Frankreich"" (in France) to specify the location of the envisioned political situation, whereas the machine-generated version omits this detail.

In summary, the reference and machine-generated versions of the text differ slightly in the level of nuance and detail, with the reference version conveying a more nuanced and less extreme meaning, and including additional information on the location of the envisioned political scenario.

However, there is a difference in the word used for ""antiquity"" or ""ancientness"" in the source text. The source text uses ""antiquity of man"" which is translated as ""Altertümer des Menschen"" in the reference and ""Altertum des Menschen"" in the machine.

 The machine translation ""Untere Stufe hat rusticated Piers mit gestauchten Obstkappen zu Sturz"" slightly differs in meaning from the reference translation ""Die untere Stufe hat verrostete Pfeiler with gezackten Fruitkaps zum Sturz.""

The main issue is with the word ""rusticated piers"" which was mistranslated as ""rusticated Piers"" in the machine translation. The word ""rusticated"" here actually means ornamental carving or having a roughened surface, but the source is referring to piers that have rust or are rusty, which is conveyed in the reference translation as ""verrostete Pfeiler"" (literally: rusted pillars).

The word ""gezackten"" in the reference is also a more accurate reflection of the intended meaning of ""fruit caps"" in the original, as opposed to ""gestauchten"" in the machine-generated version. ""Gezackt"" literally refers to notched, jagged, or serrated, which is a more fitting description of a ""fruit cap"" (a protective covering on a fruit or vegetable, often with a jagged or uneven edge, as in the case of a pineapple or cabbage) compared to ""gestaucht"" (literally: compressed, pushed in, or depressed, which doesn't quite fit the intended meaning of the original text in this context).

The only noticeable difference is the term ""First Australian Imperial Force"" which is mistranslated in the machine version as ""erste australische Kaisermacht"" (the first Australian imperial power/might).

A correct and more accurate German equivalent for ""First Australian Imperial Force "" is ""Firsten Australischen Imperialen Streitkräfte"" or ""Australische Imperialen Streitkräfte (Erste)""

The machine translation. ""Er fuhr im Senat fort und gewann die Wahl gegen W. J. Whipper 1872.""

The reference translation. ""Er blieb im Senat und gewann die Wahl gegen W. J. Whipper 1872.""

When comparing the machine and reference translations to the source, the main discrepancy is the use of ""fort fuhr im Senat"" in the machine-generated text, as opposed to ""blieb im Senat"" in the reference.

The reference Translation says ""sprunghaft nach Westen bewegte,"" which translates to ""moved erratically to the west.""

The mistake in the machine Translation is that it implies that the phenomenon moved westward unintentionally or by mistake, when the original text meant that the movement was erratic or fitful.

The other difference is that the reference Translation includes the word ""bewegte"" which means ""moved"" while the machine Translation used ""fuhr"" which means ""drove"" or ""drove"" which is not as precise as ""moved ""

However, there are a few differences that make the machine-generated version sound less idiomatic and less clear in meaning.

1. Word-for-word equivalence: The machine-generated version is a literal word-for-word translation of the original text, but it lacks the flow and nuance of the reference version. For instance, the verb ""drained"" is translated as ""entwässerte"" in the machine-generated text, but a more appropriate verb for the reference text is ""sorgte für einen Mangel an"" (caused a lack of).
2. Word choice: The word ""akademie"" is translated as ""Akademie"" in the reference text, but the word ""Marine-Akademie"" is more appropriate in the context of the text.
3. Sentence structure: The word order in the reference text is slightly different from the machine-generated one, and it is more in line with the conventions of the target language.

In summary, the machine-generated version is understandable, but it lacks the nuance and clarity of the reference text. A human-generated version can be more nuanced and clear, and it can convey the intended meaning in a more precise and culturally appropriate manner.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Word choice: The German word ""cementum"" in the source and reference text was mistranslated as ""Zement"" in the machine-generated text. ""Cemetum"" refers to a specialized type of bone-like tissue that covers the tooth root, while ""Zement"" in German is typically used to refer to a binding agent or a type of man-made material. A more accurate translation of ""cementum"" in this context is ""Zementapparat"" or ""Zahnezementanlager"" in German.

2. Gendered articles: The definite article in the German language changes depending on the gender of the noun it refers to. In the reference text, the definite article ""der"" is used, indicating that the noun it refers to is masculine. However, the machine-generated text uses the gender-neutral article ""das"" for ""Wurzelspitze"" (apex of the root), which is incorrect.

3. Word order: In the reference text, the word ""bedeckt"" (covers) is placed after the subject and the prepositional phrase, while in the machine-generated text, it is placed at the beginning of the sentence. While this is not incorrect, placing the verb at the beginning of the sentence (as in the reference text) is more common in written and formal registers of the language.

Overall, the reference text is a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the original English text, while the machine-generated text contains some errors and imprecisions.

However, there are some minor differences in wording and terminology.

Firstly, the machine translation uses the term ""Wolverinen"" to refer to the animals that were trapped, while the reference translation uses ""Vielfraß "" which is the correct term in German for a wolverine.

Secondly, the verb form ""fangen"" is used in the machine-generated text, while the reference text uses the past tense ""nahm"".

Finally, the gender of the two wolverines is not explicitly stated in the machine-generated text, whereas the reference text specifies ""ein Männchen und ein Weibchen"" (a male and a female).

 The machine translation ""Weißen in der Regel zu vergeben Wohnungen als Gehäuse für die ärmsten Schwarzen."" is quite a literal and word-for-word translation of the original English sentence. However, it differs from the reference translation in several ways, which can be evaluated as follows:

1. Word-Order:
In the machine-generated sentence, the verb ""zuweisen"" (to allocate/assign/allot.......... .) is placed after the subject ""Weißen"" (the whites) and the indirect object ""Wohnungen"" (apartments/housing units). This placement of the verb after the subject and the indirect object is a common characteristic of the standard word order in the German language. However, the reference German sentence has placed the verb ""teilen"" (allocate/distribute/divide. .) at the end of the sentence, which is a more common word-order in conversational and informal registers of the language.

2. Vocabulary:
The word ""Gehäuse"" (housing/apartment building/case/casing. .) is used in the machine-generated sentence, which is a literal and word-for-word equivalent of the word ""tenements"" in the English sentence. However, the reference sentence has used the word ""Wohnraum"" (housing/accommodation/residence. .) to refer to the housing allocated to the poor. ""Wohnraum"" is a more general and inclusive word that can refer to any housing, whether it is a single-room apartment or a multi-room house.

3. Register:
The register of the language used in the reference sentence is more conversational and informal, as evidenced by the placement of the verb at the end of the sentence and the use of the word ""teilen"" (allocate/distribute/divide. .) in the imperfect tense. The register of the language used in the machine-generated sentence is more standard and official, as evidenced by the placement of the verb in the standard word-order and the use of the word ""vergeben"" (allocate/assign/grant. .) in the present tense.

Overall, the reference sentence is a more accurate and culturally appropriate reflection of the original English sentence, as it is written in a register that is more commonly used in everyday conversation and it employs a more culturally-sensitive and inclusive language. The machine-generated sentence, on the other hand, is a literal and word-for-word equivalent of the English sentence, but it lacks the nuances and cultural sensitivities that are required for a good-quality and culturally-sensitive translation.

The word ""Grabungen"" which means excavations or excavations in the machine-generated text is not an appropriate or common translation for ""trenches"" in this context.

In the machine translation. the German word ""Harpune"" is used to translate the English word ""harpoons"", while in the reference translation, the word used is ""Harpunen"". Both words mean the same thing in German, but ""Harpunen"" is more commonly used in everyday language. Therefore, the reference version slightly more accurately reflects the way a native German would phrase the sentence.

Overall, the difference in meaning between the two translations is negligible, and the machine-generated version is still a good and usable approximation of the reference. However, if maximum accuracy and fluency are desired, it may be preferable to use the reference version.

The difference between the machine-generated and reference Translation is that the machine-generated version uses the term ""uraufgeführt"" (uraufgeführt) to describe when the TV series was shown, whereas the reference Translation correctly uses ""hat Premiere"" (hat Premiere).

Uraufgeführt means ""premiered"" or ""opened"" in the theatrical sense, but it is not commonly used to refer to when a TV series has its premiere.

On the other hand, ""hat Premiere"" (hat Premiere) is a more appropriate and commonly used phrase to refer to the first showing of a new TV series or a new season of a series.

The difference is in the German term used for ""bivalves."" In the machine translation, the term ""Biklappen"" was used, while in the reference translation, the term ""Muscheln"" was used.

""Biklappen"" is a German term that refers specifically to bivalve molluscs with hinge-like valves, whereas ""Muscheln"" is a broader term that can refer to any kind of mollusc that encloses itself in a protective shell, including bivalves.

However, in the context by the source text. ""Animal taxa found in the lake include bivalves, gastropods and ostracods"", ""bivalves"" refers to a class of molluscs having a hinged, two-part shell enclosing the soft parts, so the correct German translation should be ""Muscheln"" as used in the reference translation.

In the reference, Louis is clearly the subject, as indicated by the capitalized ""L"" and the word ""Dauphin"" appearing after it. The verb ""überzeugte"" is correctly conjugated to match the subject.

In the machine-generated sentence, the verb ""überzeugte"" is placed first, as is common in German sentences, but the subject ""Louis"" lacks a capital ""L"", and the article ""der"" is missing.

So, the primary difference between the reference and the machine-generated sentence is the lack of a definite article for Louis and the missing subject-verb agreement in the machine-generated sentence.

However, there are some differences between the two translations. Here are some of them:

1. Word choice: The machine and reference translations use slightly different words to describe the role of the person mentioned. The machine..

While the reference text uses the term ""Gastschiedsrichter"" (guest referee), the reference text opts for the more formal ""Gastschiedsrichter für das WWF-Weltmeisterschaftsspiel im Schwergewicht"" (guest referee for the WWF-World Championship in the heavyweight category).

2. Sentence structure: The reference text rearranges the sentence slightly compared to the original and the machine.

The reference text starts with the subject (er, he in this case) and follows with the verb (trat, reemerged in this case) and the details of the action (1994, bei Wrestlemania X, as a guest referee, and so on).

The machine and the original, on the other hand, follow the same sentence structure as the original, with the verb (reemerged and trat, respectively) at the beginning of the sentence.

3. Punctuation: The reference text includes a few punctuation differences compared to the machine and the original.

For instance, the reference text includes a colon (:) after the year 1994, while the original and the machine use a coma (,). Additionally, the reference text separates the title of the wrestling event ( WrestleMania X) with a coma, while the original and the machine use the word ""at"" (bei and in, respectively) to introduce the location of the action.

Overall, the reference and machine texts convey the same meaning, but the reference text is slightly more verbose and more precise in its word choices. Additionally, the reference text rearranges the sentence slightly, and includes minor punctuation changes.

1. The term used for ""turnpike"" in the source text is translated as ""Drehkreuze"" in the machine translation, whereas the reference translation uses ""gebührenpflichtige Autobahn"" which is a more accurate translation. A ""Drehkreuze"" is a rotary intersection or roundabout, not a turnpike.

Machine Translation:
Dort stationiert entdeckt er den Aufenthaltsort von Oberst Graf von Grieffenberg and ordnet seine Rückführung an.

Reference Translation:
Dort stationiert entdeckt er den Aufenthaltsort von Oberst Graf von Grieffenberg and ordnet seine Rückführung an.

In the original English, the sentence implies that the individual made the discovery and arrangement for repatriation while being stationed in a specific location. The two translations convey the same meaning, as ""dort stationiert entdeckt er den Aufenthaltsort"" (lit. 'there stationed, discovers the whereabou.t') implies that the subject made the discovery while being stationed in that location.

However, the reference and the machine-generated translation use slightly different wording. The reference text uses ""dort"" (there) to refer to the location, whereas the original text used ""there"" to refer to the location and ""stationed"" to describe the person. The machine-generated version follows the reference text and also opts for ""dort"" (there) to refer to the location.

In this specific instance, the difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is minimal, and the meaning remains the same. The primary distinction is the use of ""dort"" (there) to refer to the location, as opposed to the wording in the original text, where the location is implied in the verb ""being/being stationed/stationed.""

Given the similarity in meaning and the nuanced wording, the quality of the machine-generated text is acceptable. However, it is essential to note that the choice of words and style might differ from human-generated references, and the distinction could be more pronounced in different sentences.

The machine and reference German translations read, ""Pharnaces richtete einen Hinterhalt mit ausgewählten Infanteristen and seiner ganzen Kavallerie ein."" Both the machine and reference versions are accurate and convey the same meaning as the English source.

The word-for-word equivalent of the source in the target language (German in this case) is achieved by the machine, as well as the reference human, with no significant differences. The words in the source correspond directly to the words in the target text, and the grammatical structure is also maintained.

Therefore, the machine and reference versions of the target language (German in this case) align well with the source and with each other. No significant errors or mistranslations can be found.

 The machine translation ""Die Episode schließt mit Bloom Lesen einer Zeitschrift Geschichte namens Matcham war Masterhub, von Herrn Philip Beaufoy, während Stuhlgang im Nebengebäude"" slightly differs in meaning from the reference translation ""Die Folge endet mit Bloom, der in einer commandeer eine Zeitschrift eine Geschichte namens „Matcheams Meisterstreich“ von Herrn Philip Beaufoy liest, während er auf dem Plumpsklo sein Geschäft verrichtet.""

The main difference is in the description of where and how the action takes place. In the reference translation, the subject (Bloom. referred to as ""er"" in the sentence in German) is reading the magazine story in an outhouse while taking care of his business. The word ""Plumpsklo"" (which literally means ""plop toilet"" in English, referring to a makeshift or primitive toilet, often outside of a building) and the phrase ""sein Geschäft verrichten"" (which literally means ""to do his business,"" a common idiom in German to refer to using the toilet or relieving oneself, but also used in a more abstract sense to refer to accomplishing a task or a goal in a more serious context) convey this meaning.

In the machine-generated version, the word ""Stuhlgang"" (which literally means ""stool movement"" in English, referring to the physical act of passing stool or feces, but also used in a more abstract sense to refer to taking a dump or a shit in a more informal or crude way) is used, and the location is described as ""Nebengebäude"" (which literally means ""out-building"" in English, but in this case, it is referring to an outhouse or a toilet located outside of a building, but it is not as explicit as the reference version in conveying this meaning to the reader, and it is more likely to be interpreted as a generic building or a shed in the backyard.

In summary, the reference and the machine-generated versions differ in the level of explicitness and the use of specific words to convey the meaning of the location and the action. The reference is more explicit in conveying the idea of an outhouse and the physical action of using the toilet, while the machine-generated one is more vague and indirect in its word choices.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the main idea of the source sentence, which is about Rupert bringing the real butler to London and confronting the fake one. However, there is a slight difference in how they word the confrontation.

The machine translation uses the verb ""stellt sich dem"" (literally ""positions himself against"") to describe how Rupert confronts the fake butler. In contrast, the reference translation uses the verb ""konfrontiert"" (confonts) to describe the same action.

While both translations are grammatically correct and convey the same overall meaning. ""stellt sich dem"" could potentially imply that Rupert is facing the fake butler in a more passive or defensive manner, whereas ""konfrontiert"" implies a more active and direct approach.

In this specific context, ""konfrontiert"" might be a more appropriate translation since the sentence implies that Rupert is actively bringing the real butler to London in order to address the issue of the fake one. Therefore, the reference Translation is more accurate than the machine one.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same overall meaning as the source text, but there are some differences in how they express it.

The main difference is in how the phrase ""atoning for"" or ""washing away"" of his previous melancholy and defensive lapses is translated. The reference German translation uses the verb ""wettun"" which literally means ""make up for"" or ""compensate for"" in this context.

On the other hand, the machine-generated version uses the verb ""büßen"" with the preposition ""ab"", which literally means ""atone for/expiate"" in a religious or legal sense. However, in this context, it sounds a bit awkward and may not convey the intended meaning as accurately as the reference version.

Moreover, the reference version uses the verb ""wettun"" in the past tense, consistent with the simple past tense of the verb ""atoning for"" in the English original. The machine-generated version, however, incorrect.ly conjugates the verb ""büßen"" in the present tense, making it inconsistent with the English and the reference text.

Therefore, the reference version is more accurate and reads more naturally in conveying the meaning of the original text.

The reference translation uses ""was ihn wütend machte"" (which made him angry) to describe the effect of the action on the person being detained, while the machine simply states ""wütete ihn"" (which infuriated him).

The word ""ein"" in the machine's version is unnecessary and changes the meaning slightly, as it implies a singular item or unit, but the word ""jaywalking"" is an uncountable noun.

The source sentence mentions ""hearse trams,"" but neither the machine nor the reference version reflects this detail in the target language. The term ""hearse tram"" typically refers to a type of funeral tram used to carry hesears (coffins) during funerals.

(Note: ""Bestattungstraßenbahnen"" is the literal equivalent of ""hearse trams"" in the target language, but it is not a standard or common term in German, as the concept of ""hearse trams"" is not prevalent in the target culture.

 The machine translation ""Leutnant CF Grieve und FJ Reynolds feierten 1938 Südafrika mit den britischen Löwen"" differs from the reference translation ""Leutnant CF Grieve und FJ Reynolds tourten 1938 mit den British Lions durch Südafrika"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the verb tense is different. The source and reference translation both use the past tense ""tourten"" (third-person plural) to indicate that the action of touring occurred in the past. However, the machine translation uses the present tense ""feierten"" (third-person plural) to describe the event.

Secondly, the article ""die"" is missing in the machine-generated version. In the reference and source, the article ""den/denen"" preceding ""britischen Löwen"" is correctly included, as the article is necessary to indicate that the ""britischen Löwen"" refers to a specific group of British lions, namely the British Lions rugby team.

Finally, the word ""südlich"" is missing in the machine-generated text. The reference and the original use the word ""Südafrika"" to refer to South Africa, but the word is not preceded by an article, which means that the word is being used as a proper noun. In the reference, the word is written as ""Südafrika,"" with a lower-case ""s"" and no article, indicating that it is a common noun.

Overall, the reference and the source convey the same meaning, but the machine-generated version contains errors that make it differ from the reference. The verb tense, article, and word ""südlich"" all need to be corrected to make the text accurate.

 When comparing the machine translation to the reference translation. The main difference is the addition of the word ""richtung"" in the reference German text which is not present in the machine-generated text.

A more accurate and idiomatic rendering of the English sentence in German, in line with the reference text, is:

""Er verabschiedet sich von Sita und springt in Richtung Angad und Jambavan zurück.""

The word ""richtung"" (direction) clarifies the meaning of the sentence, as it indicates the specific goal of the action, which is to leap towards the direction of both ""Angad and Jambavan.""

The original English sentence implies this meaning, but the literal word-for-word equivalent in the first German sentence (""springt zurück nach Angad und Jambavan"") lacks the precision and nuance of the reference text. Therefore, the reference text is more accurate and a more faithful representation of the intended meaning of the English sentence.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are quite close to the source text, and they both accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. However, upon closer examination.

The only noticeable difference between the machine and reference German translations is the use of quotation marks. In the original English sentence, the phrase ""retained a fondness for McCarthy"" is set off by quotation marks, indicating that it is a direct quote. In the machine-generated version, the quotation marks are present, but in the reference version, they are missing.

The reference version correctly includes the quotation, as the original sentence intends to express the nuance that the fondness for McCarthy is not the author's personal opinion but a previously expressed sentiment by the subject of the sentence.

Therefore, the reference version is more accurate in reflecting the meaning of the English sentence, and the machine-generated one slightly missed the nuance intended in the quotation.

Vladimír Klokočka, 80, tschechischer Politiker und Jurist, Unterzeichner der Charta 77-Manifestation.

The reference manual includes ""der"" before ""Charta 77,"" making it clear that ""Charta 77"" is a specific document, in this case, the manifesto.

Therefore, the machine-generated translation is slightly inaccurate, and the complete and accurate version should be used for a correct and clear understanding of the text.

 The machine translation ""Tecumseh versammelte seine Konföderation und verbündete seine Kräfte mit der britischen Armee, die das Nordwestgebiet von Oberkanada einmarschierte"" is quite close to the reference translation ""Tecumseh versammelte seine Konföderation und verbündete seine Kräfte mit der britischen Armee, die von Oberkanada aus in das Nordwestterritorium einmarschierte"".

However, there is a slight difference in the way the place of invasion is described. The reference translation specifies that the British army invaded the Northwest Territory ""from Upper Canada"" (in German: ""aus Oberkanada""), while the machine translation simply says that the invasion took place in the Northwest area (in German: ""das Nordwestgebiet"").

While the two translations convey the same overall meaning. The reference version is more specific in describing the direction of the invasion, indicating that the British army came from ""Upper Canada"" (in this context, referring to a geopolitical entity that existed in the early 19th century, consisting of modern-day southern Ontario and surrounding areas).

The machine-generated version is less precise, and it may lead to some confusion, especially for those who are not familiar with the historical and geographical context of the source text. Therefore, it is essential to consider the context and choose the most appropriate and unambiguous phrasing.

 In this case, the source text, the machine.translation, and the reference translation are all identical. The German sentence ""Nach der Sintflut bewirtschaftet Noah den Boden und baut Reben an"" accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence ""After the Flood, Noah tills the soil and grows vines."" Therefore, it can be concluded that the machine-generated and reference translations are of high quality and accurately reflect the meaning of the original English text.

However, it is important to note that this is a relatively simple and straightforward text, and the similarity of the two German sentences is due in part to the fact that the grammatical structures of the two languages are similar in this instance. In more complex or nuanced texts, the differences between the source and target languages may require more sophisticated approaches to ensure accurate and idiomatic translations. Additionally, evaluating the quality of a single sentence or phrase may not be representative of the overall quality of a larger text or a machine-translation system.

In the source text and the reference translation, there is a comma after each craftsman category (bakers, butchers, brewers, carpenters, and blacksmiths). However, the machine translation does not include commas after each category.

While commas may not significantly impact the meaning. Punctuation plays an important role in written language, and correct punctuation can make the text easier to read and understand. Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation.

Overall, the machine-translation is of good quality and conveys the meaning of the original text. However, it could be improved with more accurate punctuation.

The German phrase ""Die Straße, die Bottcher's Gap verlässt"" literally translates to ""The road that leaves Bottcher's Gap"" and is used in both the machine and reference versions.

The description of the steep terrain is also accurately conveyed in the target language, with the term ""extremely steep terrain"" being represented as ""extrem steiles Gelände"" in the target text.

Finally, the requirement for ""four narrow switchbacks"" is also accurately conveyed in the target text, with the machine and reference versions both reading ""was vier enge Serpentinen erfordert"" in the target text.

Overall, the machine and reference versions of the target text are very similar, with no significant differences in meaning or tone. The primary difference between the two is the word ""diese"" in the reference version, which is not present in the machine version. However, this is a minor stylistic variation that does not impact the overall meaning of the target text. Therefore, the machine and reference versions of the target text can be considered equivalent in terms of meaning and accuracy.

2. Walleye: this term is directly translated from English to German in the machine translation, but it is not a commonly used term or a known fish species name in German. In the reference translation, ""Zander"" is used which is a type of fish known in German.
3. Whitefish: the term ""Weißfische"" in the machine and reference translations is correct, but it is a general category of freshwater fish, not a specific one.
4. Speckled trout: the machine incorrectly interprets ""speckled trout"" as ""gesprenkelten"" in the target language, but the reference correctly interprets it as ""gesprenkelten Forellen"" (lit. spotted trout in the reference, which is a more specific and correct interpretation of the English source text.

Overall, the reference text is more specific and accurate in the interpretation of the English text, especially in the case of the ""zander"" and ""gesprenkelten forellen"" interpretations. The machine text is less specific and less accurate in the interpretation of the original text.

In the machine translation, the verb ""flogen"" is used, which means ""f leadership verb 'to fly' in past tense. However, in the reference translation, the verb ""hielt"" is used, which means ""to hold"" in present tense.

Additionally, the word ""stolzen"" is used in the machine-generated text, which means ""proud"" but in this context, it is not appropriate.

The reference-quality human-generated text, on the other hand, correctly renders the meaning of the original text, with the verb ""hielt"" and the correct meaning of the pride-themed flag.

Therefore, the machine-generated text differs significantly from the reference-level human-generated text in meaning and correctness.

The reference-provided version, on the other hand, utilizes the verb ""wackeln"" which is more appropriate in this case, as it implies a less rhythmic and more irregular motion, more in line with the wiggling motion of a severed lizard tail.

2. Adjective-noun agreement: in the phrase ""less-adventurous, the beagles"", the adjective ""weniger abenteuerlich"" is placed next to ""Beagles"" in the machine's version, while the reference correctly inserts the adjective in the previous clause, ""if less-adventurous, with the beagles"" (lit.

Moreover, the word ""Töpfe"" (pots) is written with a capital ""T"" in the reference version, indicating that it is a proper noun. However, the word is written with a lower-case ""t"" in the machine-generated sentence, which is grammatically correct but may not convey the intended meaning.

Therefore, the revised machine-generated sentence is: ""Goblin-Spiritualität dreht sich um den Unggue, die Sammlung von körperlichen Sekreten wie Ohrenschmalz in magischen Töpfen.""

The source English sentence uses the word ""notched"" to describe the protagonist's fourth consecutive win over Novak Djokovic.

In this context, the word ""Adjunkt"" is the appropriate word to use, as the definition of the bounded linear operator is related to the concept of the ""adjoint of a linear map with respect to an inner-product space/dual-space ""

So the machine Translation is incorrect, and it should be ""adjoint of "" in this context.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source sentence, which is that Mackrell pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. However, there are some differences between the two translations.

The machine-generated translation renders ""pleaded not guilty"" as ""plädierte auf nicht schuldig"" (plädierte auf nicht schuldig), while the reference human-generated one has ""bekannte sich...nicht schuldig"" (bekannte sich nicht schuldig).

A direct translation of ""pleaded not guilty"" in German is ""gestand ein nicht schuldig"" or ""bekannte sich nicht schuldig"". The reference version is more accurate in this case, as ""bekannte sich nicht schuldig"" is the standard and correct legal term for ""pleaded not guilty"" in a court of law in German.

The machine-generated version, ""plädierte auf nicht schuldig"", is less precise and less commonly used in a legal setting. Additionally, the word ""auf"" is unnecessary in this context and makes the sentence sound awkward.

Therefore, the reference version is more accurate and more appropriate for a legal context.

 The machine translation ""Illingworth eingefasst Simpson in Harvey's Hände für eine Ente"" is different from the reference translation ""Illingworth schob Simpson für eine Ente in Harveys Hände.""

The main difference is in the verb used to describe the action taken by ""Illingworth."" In the machine translation, the verb ""einfasste"" is used, which means ""embraced"" or ""handled"" in this context. However, in the reference translation, the verb ""schob"" is used, which means ""pushed"" or ""placed.""

The verb ""einfassten"" in the machine-generated text is not entirely incorrect, but it conveys a slightly different meaning from the reference text. The reference text suggests that Illingworth physically placed Simpson in Harvey's hands for a duck, while the machine-generated text implies that Illingworth held or embraced him in some way.

Moreover, the verb tense in the machine-generated text is inconsistent. The verb ""einfasste"" is in the past tense, while the verb ""haben"" (which is not present in the reference text) is in the present tense.

In summary, the main differences between the machine-generated and reference text are:

1. The verb used to describe the action taken by ""Illingworth""
2. The verb tense in the sentence

To improve the quality of the English-to-German text generation, the system should consider using the verb ""schob"" (pushed or placed) and ensure consistent verb tenses throughout the sentence.

First, the term ""fourteen shells"" in the source text is translated as ""vierzehn Muscheln"" in the machine translation, whereas the reference translation uses the more accurate ""vierzehn Kanonenkugeln"" (both terms refer to ammunition, but ""Kanonenkugeln"" specifically refers to cannonball-type munition, which fits the context better).

Second, the phrase ""in the right gun barrel in the center turret"" is translated as ""in der rechten Pistole Lauf in der Mitte Revolver"" in the machine translation. A ""Pistole Lauf"" literally translates to ""piston sleeve/barrel"" but in the context of a turret and gun, it's more appropriate to use the word ""Geschützrohr"" (cannon barrel/gun barrel) and ""mittleren Geschützturm"" (center turret).

Finally, the machine-generated ""Zerstörung der Waffe"" (weapon destruction) differs slightly from the reference's ""das Geschütz"" (the cannon/gun/weapon specifically).

The word ""boarding"" in English can have different meanings, one of them is related to ships and embarking/disembarking, the other one is a synonym for storming, attacking.

The word ""Kollision"" or ""Kollisions-"" is related to a crash, or a crash-like attack, which fits the context of the original sentence more.

The source sentence talks about the attack, and the attack outcome, where the attack is won by the last attacking player, and the one who lost the attack receives the hits.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the verb tense used to describe the descent to the Bear River Valley.

In the source text and reference translation, the verb ""descended/hinab"" is used to describe the action of the main trail going down to the Bear River Valley. However, the machine translation uses the verb ""stieg"". which means ""climbed"" or ""ascended"" in this context.

A correct translation of the source would be: ""Von Fort Bridger, der Hauptweg, bestehend aus mehreren Varianten, kehrete nordwestlich über den Bear River Divide und führte hinab zum Bear River Tal."" (literally: ""From Fort Bridger, the main trail, comprising several variants, turned northwest over the Bear River Divide and led down to the Bear River Valey."").

The verb tense in the machine-generated text is inconsistent with the tense in the original text, and conveys a different meaning. Therefore, it is important to carefully review and correct the verb tenses in the machine-generated text to ensure accurate and consistent meaning.

 The machine translation ""Anfang August nahm Javier die Intensivierung wieder auf und gewann die Intensität der Kategorie 3 bei 0600 UTC zurück"" differs from the reference translation ""Anfang August nahm Javier wieder an Fahrt auf und erlangte 0600 UTC die Intensität der Kategorie 3 zurück"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the verb tenses used in the two translations differ. The machine translation uses the present perfect tense ""nahm...wieder auf"" to describe the resumption of intensification, whereas the reference translation uses the past tense ""nahm...wieder an Fahrt auf"" for the same purpose.

Second, the verb ""erlangen"" in the reference translation is replaced with ""gewinnen"" in the machine translation. While both words can be translated to ""to gain"" or ""to obtain"", ""erlangen"" is more appropriate here as it implies a gradual process of building up intensity, as opposed to a sudden acquisition.

Finally, the word ""zurück"" in the reference translation is missing in the machine translation. This word is important as it emphasizes the return to the previous intensity of the category 3 level.

Overall, the reference translation is more precise and nuanced in conveying the meaning of the original English text. The machine translation, while understandable, lacks the subtle differences in word choice and verb tense that are crucial for conveying the intended meaning.

The main difference between the two translations is the placement of the adverb ""then."" In the source sentence and the reference translation, ""then"" appears after ""Dorothy"" and is set off by a pair of commas, indicating that it describes when the action takes place. In contrast, the machine translation places the word ""then"" at the end of the sentence, making it sound as if the action of disappearing is happening at that moment, which is not the intended meaning.

1. Word order: The machine correctly translated the sentence structure, but placed the phrase ""vor allem mit dem Waldbussard"" (especially with the forest buzzard) in the wrong position. In the reference, this phrase is added at the end of the sentence to emphasize the close relationship between the wintering steppe buzzards and the forest buzzards.

2. Punctuation: The reference text correctly uses a comma to separate the two elements of the coordinating structure (neben dem Bergbussard and vor allem mit dem Waldbussard). The machine, however, omits the first of the two commas, which slightly impairs the readability of the sentence.

3. Word form: The word ""während"" (while, during) is correctly used in the reference, but the machine incorrectly used ""und vor allem mit"" (and especially with) in the machine-generated text.

Overall, the machine-generated text is understandable and conveys the meaning of the original, but it contains minor errors that could be avoided with proper editing and proofreading. The primary issue is the misplacement of the emphasizing phrase, but the other errors also contribute to the slight discrepancy in the quality of the reference and the machine-generated text.

The reference German Translation correctly reflects the passive voice by using the past participle ""ausgestrahlt"" with the auxiliary verb ""wurde"" for the subject ""Vaughan"" and ""firstmals ausgestrahlt"" with the auxiliary verb ""hat"" for the subject ""Jackson"".

However, the machine Translation uses the simple past tense ""ausgestrahlt"" without auxiliary verb for both ""Vaughan"" and ""Jackson "" which is not grammatically correct in this context.

The reference and machine-generated German sentences both use the same grammatical structure to convey the meaning of the English sentence. They both use the present tense ""blieben"" (stayed/remained) to describe the ongoing presence of the diesel sternwheelers on the rivers.

The only minor difference between the reference and machine-generated sentences is the placement of the word ""auf den Flüssen"" (on the rivers). In the reference sentence, it appears at the very end, while in the machine-generated sentence, it appears earlier in the sentence.

 The machine translation ""In, unterzeichnete Shapiro Veteran Hilfe für die Stift und Außenfeld in der Nebensaison"" differs from the reference translation ""In , unterzeichnete Shapiro Veteranhilfe für die Arrestzelle und das Außenfeld in der Nebensaison"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the German definite article ""der"" is missing in the machine-generated translation before the word ""Stift"" (which should be ""der Stift,"" or ""the bullpen"" in English).

Secondly, the word ""Veteran"" should be capitalized in the reference version as it is a proper noun referring to a person or group of people.

Finally, the word ""Hilfe"" (which means ""help"" in English) is not present in the reference version. A more accurate and faithful rendering of the original English sentence would be: ""In , unterzeichnete Shapiro Hilfe für Veteranen für die Stift und Außenfeld in der Nebensaison.""

The reference version correctly renders the English ""veteran help for the bullpen and outfield"" as ""Hilfe für Veteranen für die Stift und Außenfeld"" (literally, ""help for veterans for the bullpen and outfield"").

Therefore, the reference and machine-generated versions differ in the inclusion of the definite article, the proper noun, and the word ""Hilfe"" (help).

The machine-generated Translation is also accurate and conveys the same meaning as the source and reference.

So, the difference is subtle, but the reference and the source convey the meaning slightly better, in that the word ""verzichtete"" is more explicit in meaning ""gave up or renounced"" in the context of the sentence, whereas the machine-generated Translation is just a literal word-for-word Translation of the original.

Overall, the difference is not significant, and the machine-generated Translation is still accurate, but the reference Translation is slightly better in this instance.

The machine-generated sentence is: ""Nhu beschuldigte die Buddhisten, ihre Pagoden zum Hauptquartier für Aufstände gemacht zu haben.""

A careful comparison of the reference and the machine-generated sentence reveals that the reference sentence has the verb ""umgewandelt"" (translates to ""converted/transformed/translated""), whereas the machine-generated sentence has the verb ""gemacht"" (which is the past tense of ""machen"" and can be translated to ""made/created/produced"").

The verb ""umgewandelt"" is a more appropriate verb to use in this context, as it implies that the transformation of the pagodas was done with ill intent. The verb ""gemacht"" is neutral and does not convey the same meaning.

Therefore, the reference sentence is a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the meaning of the English sentence. The machine-generated sentence is technically correct, but it lacks the subtle meaning that the reference sentence conveys.

The machine and reference versions also both make clear that the tornado was the deadliest in Japan since 1941. However, the machine version omits the clarification that people were killed and injured.

Therefore, the primary difference is the inclusion of ""9 Personen"" and ""26"" in the reference version, which clarifies the human impact of the tornado. The difference is subtle, but it is important to note that the reference explicitly confirms the number of casualties, while the machine version does not.

To improve the quality of the machine-generated text, the addition of ""tötete 9 Personen und 26 verletzte"" (killed 9 and injured 26) to the machine-generated sentence is recommended.

 Both the machine translation and the reference transformation are very close to the original English sentence, which is unsurprising given their identical wording. In this specific case, there is no significant difference between the two.

However, it is important to note that the sentence structure in the original English differs from the one in the target languages (German, in this case). In the original, the clause ""isolated from both the Episcopalians and the Old Catholics"" precedes the verb ""turned"" and describes the subject ""Vilatte."" In contrast, the corresponding clause ""von den Bischöfen und den alten Katholiken isoliert"" is placed after the verb ""wandte sich"" and also after the subject in the German sentence.

This difference in sentence structure is common between English and many other languages, including but not limited to, the German language. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the meaning of the sentence is not altered during the translation process, even if the sentence structure is changed.

In this specific instance, the meaning of the sentence is preserved in the machine and reference translations. However, it is essential to be aware of these subtle differences, especially if the text contains more nuanced information.

Additionally, a human translator would proofread and edit their work to ensure that it is error-free and flows naturally in the target language, whereas a machine does not have this capability.

Overall, the two translations are identical, but it's important to note that machine translation tools often lack the context awareness and editing capabilities of a human professional translator.

The main difference is in the way the machine translation renders the phrase ""she struggled with addictions."" In the source text and reference translation, the preposition ""with"" is correctly translated as ""gegen"" in German, which implies a struggle or conflict. However, the machine incorrect.ly renders it as ""mit Sucht"" (with addiction), instead of ""gegen die Sucht"" (against addiction). This subtle but significant difference in meaning conveys a different nuance, suggesting that the person was accompanied by an addiction, rather than actively struggling against it.

Overall, the reference and machine translations differ in their conveyance of the person's relationship with addiction, with the reference correctly conveying a sense of struggle, and the machine failing to convey this nuance. Additionally, the reference correctly inserts the article ""die"" in the phrase ""gegen die Sucht"", emphasizing the specificity of the struggle, whereas the machine omits this article, resulting in a more ambiguous meaning.

In the source text, the subject of the action is ""pits crews/Grubenarbeiter"" who are scuffling. However, in the machine-generated text, the subject of the action is ""the pits/Gruben"" which are bending.

However, there are a few differences between the machine translation and the reference translation that make the machine translation less polished and natural-sounding.

First, the machine translation uses the present tense of the verb ""werden"" (werden), which means ""to become,"" whereas the reference translation uses the passive form of the verb ""werden"" (wird), which is more appropriate in this context.

Second, the machine translation renders ""infanticide"" as ""Kindermord,"" which is a more dramatic and emotionally-charged term than the more neutral ""Childsmord"" in the reference translation.

Finally, the word ""paternity"" in the source text is translated as ""Vaterschaft"" in the machine translation, which is a literal translation of the word. However, the reference translation uses the more idiomatic ""durch sie ungewiss wird,"" which means ""becomes unclear through it"" to convey the idea of uncertain paternity.

Overall, while the machine translation is understandable. It could be improved both in terms of grammatical correctness and fluency by making the changes mentioned above.

 The machine translation ""Im Mai 2011, Danson neckte eine ""spannende"" kommenden Storyline mit Leanne."" is mostly accurate, but there is one small difference when compared to the reference translation.

In the source text, the word ""teased"" is used to describe how Danson introduced the upcoming storyline involving Leanne. The reference translation conveys this meaning by using the phrase ""neckte eine aufregende bevorstehende Geschichte an"" (literally, ""introduced an exciting upcoming storyline about"").

However, the machine translation uses the word ""spannende"" (exciting) to describe the storyline, whereas the reference translation uses the word ""aufregende"" (exciting). While both words convey a similar meaning, the reference uses a slightly different word, suggesting that the reference may have used a slightly different word choice or style.

Overall, the machine translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, but a careful evaluation of the specific words and phrasing used can reveal subtle differences in meaning and nuance.

 The machine translation "" Nachdem der Umzug so schnell, wie es aufkam, floundered, Hamilton schnell wieder in die Liga"" differs from the reference translation in a few ways.

Firstly, the term used in the source text, ""move,"" is translated as ""Umzug"" in the machine-generated text, which means ""move"" or ""relocation"" in a literal sense. However, the reference text uses ""Schachzug"" (literally, ""chess move"" or ""stratagem"") to convey the metaphor of Hamilton quickly changing his affiliation from the move to rejoin the league.

Second, the verb ""floundered"" is not accurately conveyed in the machine-generated version. The verb is not translated at all, and the verb ""floundered"" is used in the literal sense of struggling to stay afloat. The reference version, however, correctly interprets the meaning of the word in the context of the text, using the verb ""ins Schwimmen geriet"" (literally, ""got into swimming"") to depict the sudden and unexpected change in Hamilton's affiliation.

Finally, the verb tenses used in the reference and machine-generated texts differ. The reference text correctly uses the pluperfect tense ""hatte ins Schwimmen geraten"" to describe the previous action of the ""floundered"" verb, while the machine-generated text incorrecty utilizes the present perfect tense ""floundered"" to convey the same meaning.

Overall, the reference version is more accurate and nuanced in its interpretation of the original text, and the machine-generated text contains errors in the interpretation of the text and the verb tenses used.

 The machine translation ""Subbranding hilft, Angebote zu artikulieren und zu konstruieren"" is different from the reference translation ""Subbranding hilft, Angebote darzustellen und zu erstellen"" in the way it conveys the meaning of ""articulate"" and ""construct/create

""Articulate"" means to express or explain something clearly and effectively. In the reference translation, ""darstellen"" is used, which is a more appropriate translation for ""articulate an offering/make an offering clearer"" in the given context.

""Construct/create"" generally means to build or make something from scratch, but in the reference translation, ""erstellen"" is used, which is a more appropriate choice for ""form/fashion an offering/give a specific form to an offering/bring an offering into being""

So, the reference and the machine-generated versions differ in the way the meaning of ""articulate an offering/clarify an offering "" and ""construct/fashion an offering "" is conveyed.

The reference version is more appropriate and clear in the given context.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original English source text, which is a good sign that the content and meaning have been accurately conveyed.

The only minor difference between the two translations is the use of a lowercase ""e"" in ""einsiedelei"" in the machine-generated version, whereas the reference version has an initial capital. This is not a significant difference in meaning, as both refer to a hermitage or recluse's dwelling.

Apart from that, the two translations share the same vocabulary and structure, indicating that the machine-generated one is accurate and fit for purpose. The words ""surreale allegorische Landschaft"" accurately convey the fantastical and symbolic nature of the landscape that Percivale travels through, while ""eine Einsiedelei"" correctly describes the location where he meets Galahad.

 The source text states that the distinctive headgear of the flamen *was* the apex. Both the machine and reference translations reflect this, rendering it as ""Die markante Kopfbedeckung der Flamen war die Spitze"" in German.

However. upon closer examination, there is a subtle difference between the machine and reference translations. In the reference translation, the word ""Spitze"" is used, which can mean ""top, tip, or edge"" in English. In the context of the sentence, it seems to refer to the apex or pinnacle of the headgear.

The machine, on the other hand, also translated the word ""Spitze"" as ""Spitze"" in the target language, which may not be the best choice. A more accurate and culturally appropriate word for ""apex or pinnacle"" in this context is ""Gipfel"" or ""Scheitelpunkt"" in the singular.

Therefore, the reference and machine translations differ in the nuance of the meaning of the target language, with the reference being more culturally and linguistically appropriate.

Overall, the machine's accuracy is acceptable, but it lacks the nuance and cultural understanding that a human can provide.

The reference German text, which is presumably a professional human-generated translation, is ""Am 49. Tag nominierte Adam Damien und Estefania für den Auszug.""

A comparison of the two translations reveals that the machine-generated version contains an error. The word ""Räumung"" in the machine-generated version is not an accurate translation of the English word ""eviction"" in the original text. A more accurate rendering of the original English sentence would be ""Am Tag 49 hat Adam Damien and Estefania für die Vertreibung nominiert.""

The reference text correctly renders the word ""eviction"" as ""Auszug,"" which is a more precise and appropriate term in this context. The word ""Auszug"" refers to the action of moving or leaving a place, which is more in line with the meaning of ""eviction"" in the original text.

In contrast, the word ""Räumung"" in the machine-generated version is more commonly used to refer to the physical removal of objects or people from a space, such as a building or a room. Therefore, the use of ""Räumung"" in the machine-generated version is not an ideal choice in this context.

Overall, the reference text is a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the original English text, and the machine-generated version contains an error in the use of the word ""Räumung"" that makes it less precise and less faithful to the original.

 The source English text states that the borough of Millersburg and Upper Paxton Township are included or encompassed. Both the machine and reference translations have been translated into German relatively accurately, as both use the German word ""umfasst"" which means encompass or include.

However, upon closer examination, the reference and machine-generated text slightly differ in their usage of the word ""gemeinde."" In the reference text, ""gemeinde"" is used to refer to the borough of Millersburg, whereas, in the machine-generated text, ""gemeinde"" is used to refer to the entire entity that is encompassing.

A correct and more precise rendering of the source text in the machine-generated translation would be:

""Es umfasst die Gemeinde von Millersburg and Upper Paxton Township.""

Here, the ""gemeinde von"" (the borough of) clarifies that the ""umfasst"" refers to the individual entities, and not the entity that is doing the including. Therefore, the reference and source texts convey the same meaning, but the machine-generated one slightly differs in its nuance.

The reference Translation: ""Stämme wie die Westgoten and Vandalen zogen es vor, ihre Feinde easy to overrun as a massive horde.""

Comparison:

* In the machine Translation, the verb ""stürmen"" is used, which means ""to rush/to storm"" while the reference Translation uses ""zu überrennen"" which means ""to overrun"".

The verb to ""overrun"" means to advance over (a piece of ground) and occupy it, or to cover or infiltrate (an area or a group of people) and take control of it. The verb to rush/to storm means to attack or charge (an enemy or place) suddenly and quickly.

The reference Translation is more accurate as it conveys the meaning of the original text, which is that the mentioned tribes used to quickly and easily defeat their enemies, by using the verb ""überrennen"" (to overrun/overrun)

The verb to rush/to storm in the machine Translation, although not incorrect, it is less appropriate in this context, as it implies a more aggressive and less controlled action.

Overall, the reference Translation is more precise and accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text.

In the source text, the word in question is ""bleachers"" which refers to long seats or benches in a stadium or similar place for spectators. The German word for ""bleachers"" is ""Tribüne"" or ""Sitzplätze/Stehplätze für Zuschauer/innen in einer Sportarena oder ähnlichen Veranstaltungsorten/-stätte/-orten/-plätzen/-e"".

1. Definite article ""the"" in ""the schooner Clorinda"" is missing in the machine-generated translation.
2. The verb ""reiste"" (traveled) in the machine-generated version is in past tense, while the reference version uses the present tense ""reistet"" (travels). However, since the original English sentence is in the past tense, the reference version is more accurate.

However, there is one subtle but important difference between the two. The word ""pinned down"" in the original English sentence implies that the Confederates were being held in place or prevented from advancing by the fire. The word ""fesselte"" (fettered, or bound) in the machine-generated sentence does convey this meaning, but less strongly.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Criminal coercion: by ""kriminellen Zwang"" the machine seems to have translated the term as ""criminal coercion"" which is not quite accurate. The reference has used ""Hausfriedensbruch"" which means ""Trespassing"" in this context.

2. Unlawful imprisonment: the machine has used the word ""rechtswidrige Inhaftierung"" which means ""unlawful detention or imprisonment "" but the reference has used ""Hausfriedensbruch "" which means ""trespassing ""

3. Kidnapping: the word used in the machine and reference is the same ""Entführung ""

4. The other words ""Gefährdung "" and ""Belästigung "" in the machine and reference also mean the same ""endangerment "" and ""harassment"" respectively.

So the main difference is in the words ""Unlawful imprisonment "" and ""trespassing "" and ""Criminal coercion ""

Overall, the machine has done a decent job in this case, but the subtle differences in meaning of the specific words can lead to confusion. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the context and meaning of the text to ensure accurate and effective communication.

In the machine translation, the verb ""wiedergewinnen"" is used to convey the idea of regaining intensity, whereas in the reference translation, the verb ""erlangen"" is used. Both verbs can convey the same basic meaning of obtaining or achieving something, but ""wiedergewinnen"" specifically implies that the intensity was previously possessed and then regained.

Additionally, the word order in the two translations differs slightly. In the machine translation, the subject of the sentence is ""Muifa,"" whereas in the reference translation, the subject is implied to be ""er"" (it). The verb in the machine translation is also in a different position, appearing after the subject and the date, whereas in the reference translation, the verb is in second position, following only the subject.

The subtle distinction lies in the meaning of ""garrisoning a fort"" and ""guarding/keeping a watch over a fort."" While the verb ""bewachen/bewachten"" (to guard/watch over in the past tense in the machine and reference text) conveys the sense of watching over a location, the verb ""garrisoned"" in the original text implies a more active and intensive presence of soldiers or military personnel, suggesting that the location is secured and protected by a significant number of troops.

Therefore, the reference and machine-generated text slightly differ in meaning from the original text, as the nuance of a ""garrisoned"" location is not fully conveyed. To improve the quality of the machine-generated text, the following more nuanced and accurate version of the sentence is suggested:

S Sie errichteten in Colombo eine Festung und quartierten Truppen ein.

(Sie errichteten in Colombo eine Festung und quartierten Truppen ein.)

 The machine translation ""2 Truppe und Kommandozentrale würden den Strandkopf sichern"" differs from the reference translation ""2 Truppen- und Kommandozentralen würden den Brückenkopf sichern"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the German word ""Truppe"" in the machine translation does not accurately translate the English word ""troop"" in the source. A more accurate translation of ""troop"" would be ""Truppe"" or ""Einheit"" in German. ""Kommandozentrale"" is also not a direct translation of ""commando headquarters"" and sounds more like a ""command center"" or ""command post"" in this context.

Second, the noun ""Strandkopf"" (beachhead) is used in the machine-generated text, but the reference text utilizes the more appropriate ""Brückenkopf"" (bridgehead or foothold). A beachhead typically refers to the area of ground or water first occupied and controlled by a military force when landing on a hostile coast, whereas a bridgehead refers to a protected area or position on the enemy's side of a natural or man-made obstacle, such as a river or a minefield.

In summary.

1. ""Truppe"" is not an accurate rendering of ""troop""
2. ""Kommandozentrale"" is not equivalent to ""commando headquarters""
3. ""Strandkopf"" (beach) is not the same as ""Brückenkopf"" (bridgehead or foothold)

A more accurate and nuanced machine-generated text would be:

""2 Truppen oder Einheiten und Kommandozentralen würden einen Brückenkopf sichern.""

The difference lies in the word ""pagan(s)"" in the original English text, which neither the machine nor the reference translations have directly translated. The word ""heidnisch"" in the machine-generated text and ""heidnischen"" in the reference text both mean ""pagan"" or ""heathenish/heathen"" in the original English, but they refer to the ""sons of Sæberht"" and not to the ""East Saxons"" as the context implies.

The reference Translation provided. ""Der Blaustreifen-Putzerlippfisch kitzelt seinen Kunden sanft, während er ihn von Parasiten befreit."" Translates to ""The bluestreak cleaner-lippfish gently caresses its customer while freeing it of parasites.""

The main difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the description of the action performed by the blue streak. In the reference, the bluestreak is actively ""freeing it of parasites"" while the machine-generated version merely describes it as ""snacking on the parasites""

The word ""kitzelt"" in the machine-generated version is also less precise in describing the meaning of the original text, as it can be interpreted as a light, playful, or sensual touch, while the reference text implies a more intentional and helpful behavior.

Overall, the reference text provides more information and a clearer picture of the situation described in the original text, compared to the machine-generated version.

In the source text, the verb ""stymie"" is used which means to obstruct or to frustrate. The verb ""stylisieren"" in the machine-generated text does not convey the same meaning. Instead, the verb ""stylisieren"" is closer in meaning to ""stylize"" in English. A correct German equivalent for the English verb ""stymy"" that fits the context is "" behindern"", which is used in the reference Translation.

Moreover, the verb tense in the machine-generated text is inconsistent. The verb ""marchierte"" is in the past tense, while the verb ""stylisieren"" is in the present tense. In contrast, the reference Translation consistently employs the imperfekt tense, which is appropriate for narrating past actions.

In summary, the main differences between the machine-generated and reference Translation are the verb tense and the meaning conveyed by the verb. The reference Translation is consistent in verb tense and accurately reflects the meaning of the verb ""stymy"" in the context of the text.

The reference, on the other hand, has rendered the same fragment as ""verfasste seit den 1950er Jahren und sechs Jahrzehnte lang rund 40 Romane, 200 Kurzgeschichten sowie zwei Autobiografien"" (with a semicolon and "" sowie"" added to the end of the enumeration, and the removal of the word ""abgesehen von"").

The reference's use of a semicolon and ""sowie"" (or ""as well as"" in English) is more idiomatic and clear, as it properly separates the different items in the enumeration and avoids the potential ambiguity of the word ""abgesehen von"" (or ""apart from"" in English). Therefore, the reference's version is more accurate and preferable to the machine's.

Moreover, the reference's inclusion of ""seit den 1950er Jahren und sechs Jahrzehnte lang"" (or ""since the 1950s and for six decades"") is more in-depth and descriptive, as it clarifies the time period in question.

1. Terminology: The source and reference use the correct anatomical terms ""head of the femur"" and ""femoral head"" which are translated as ""runde Kopf des Weibchens"" in the machine-translation. ""Weibchen"" is not an appropriate term in this context, as it refers specifically to a female animal, while ""Femurkopf"" (femoral head) is the correct medical term.

3. Sentence structure: The word order in the machine-generated text differs from the reference and the original, leading to a less clear and awkward sentence structure.

In conclusion, the machine-generated text differs significantly from the reference in its use of incorrect and awkward word choices, as well as poor sentence structure.

The word ""at"" in the English text, which indicates the role of Bertrand de Forcade in the event, is translated as ""bei"" in the reference text, but the machine-generated version uses ""unterstützte"" (supported/aided) to describe the role of the curate.

The word ""unterstützte"" is not an incorrect choice, but it implies a more active role in the proceedings, rather than simply being present. The reference text, in contrast, simply states that Bertrand was present at the notarized contract, without specifying any additional involvement.

Overall, the difference between the reference and machine-generated versions is minor, and the meaning of the text is still conveyed in the machine-generated version. However, the use of a more active verb in the machine-generated text may lead to a slightly different interpretation of the role of the curate.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, both in meaning and in wording. However, there is one difference in the description of the Russian ship that is noteworthy.

In the source and reference text. the Russian ship is referred to as a ""sloop"" and ""Schaluppe"" respectively. A sloop is a type of sailing vessel with a single mast, while a ""Schaluppe"" is a small, fast sailing ship.

However, the machine-generated text refers to the Russian ship as a ""Schleuder,"" which is not a correct term for any type of ship.

The reference text correctly refers to the Russian ship as a ""Schaluppe"" which is a more accurate and appropriate term.

Here are the main differences:

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the subjects ""2"" and ""Michael Kim"" are next to each other, while in the reference translation, they are separated by the verb ""umgeht"" (bypasses).
2. Phrasing: In the machine translation, the verb ""unter Umgehung"" (bypassing) is used, while in the reference, the verb ""umgeht"" (bypasses) is used.

The reference Translation:

 The machine translation ""Der Geruch warnt Raubtiere oft vor Kakapo"" differs from the reference translation ""Der Geruch macht Raubtiere oft auf die Anwesenheit von Kakapos aufmerksam"" in that it conveys a different meaning.

In the source text, ""The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapo,"" the word ""alerts"" implies that the smell of the kakapo draws the attention of predators to its presence. However, the machine-generated translation ""Der Geruch warnt Raubtiere oft vor Kakapo"" literally translates to ""The smell often warns predators about kakapo,"" which conveys a different meaning.

The reference-quality human-generated translation correctly conveys the meaning of the original text by stating ""Der Geruch macht Raubtiere oft auf die Anwesenheit von Kakapos aufmerksam,"" or ""The smell often makes predators aware of the kakapo's presence.""

Therefore. the primary difference between the two translations is that the machine-generated version conveys a meaning that is not consistent with the original text, whereas the reference-level human-generated version accurately reflects the intended meaning.

However, there is a slight but significant difference in word order between the two translations. The reference translation correctly inserts the word ""an"" (which means ""on,"" ""at,"" or ""to"" in this context, and is used to indicate arrival or appearance) after the subject and the phrase ""to the first time"" (eine Erste-Mal-Ankunft or erstmals).

In contrast, the machine translation omits the word ""an"" and places the phrase ""to the first time"" after the verb, resulting in a less-fluent and slightly awkward sentence.

Thus, the reference translation is more accurate and more closely reflects the original English text.

However, there are some differences between the two translations.

1. Use of Present Participle: The machine. translation uses the present participle ""flüchtete"" (fled) to describe the gang's action, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""flor"" (floh).

The reference translation renders the same sentence as ""Ungarische Truppen konterkarierten bei Fegyvernek und griffen die rumänische 1. Infanterie-Division an.""

A comparison of the two translations reveals that the machine translation differs slightly from the reference in the verb form used to describe the engagement of the Hungarian forces with the Romanian 1st Infantry.

In the reference, the verb ""griffen"" is used to describe the engagement, while the machine-generated version employs the verb ""schlossen sich an"", meaning ""joined in"".

A correct and more accurate rendering of the original English sentence in the target language (German) is: ""Ungarische Truppen konterkarierten bei Fegyvernek und griffen die rumänische 1. Infanterie-Division an.""

The verb ""griffen"" is the correct and most fitting verb to use in this context, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The verb ""an-schliessen"" (an + sich + an, meaning ""to join in/to attach to something"") is not an appropriate substitute for the verb ""to engage in a military conflict with an enemy force/division/troops, in this case, the 1. rumänischen Infanteriedivision.

Therefore, the reference and the correct target-language version of the sentence is: ""Ungarische Truppen konterkarierten bei Fegyvernek and griffen die rumänische 1. Infanterie-Division an.""

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are quite similar and convey the same overall meaning. However, there is a slight difference in the word choice used to translate ""general social fraternity"" from English to German.

In the source text, ""general social fraternity"" refers to a social organization composed of men who share common interests and values. In the machine translation, the term ""allgemeine soziale Brüderlichkeit"" (general social brotherhood) is used, while in the reference, the same words are used in the same order.

However, a more accurate and idiomatic rendering of ""general social fraternity"" in this context might be ""allgemeiner Studentenverbindung"" or simply ""Studentenverbindung"" in German, as it more accurately conveys the meaning of a social organization composed of students.

The only difference between the machine and reference Translation is the addition of a comma after each profession in the reference Translation.

In the source text, each profession is separated by a comma, and the reference Translation follows this format. However, the machine Translation lists the professions one after the other without commas, resulting in a single string of words.

In general, the addition or omission of punctuation may not significantly impact the overall meaning of a text. However, it can improve readability and clarity, especially in a list of items like this.

Therefore, the reference Translation is more preferable to the machine Translation as it is more readable and adheres to standard punctuation rules.

Overall, the difference between the two Translations is minor, and the machine Translation is still accurate. However, the reference Translation is more preferable for readability and clarity.

Firstly, the machine translation uses the word ""Unterpinsel"". This is a literal translation of the English word ""underbrush,"" but it is not a commonly used or recognized term in German. A more appropriate translation would be ""Unterholz,"" as used in the reference translation.

Secondly, the verb tense in the machine translation is inconsistent. The verb ""marshiert"" is in the present tense, while the verb ""schießt"" is in the past tense. The reference translation correctly uses the past tense for both actions.

Finally, the wording of the final action in the machine translation is also slightly different. The reference translation uses the verb ""erschießt"" to describe the act of shooting, while the machine-generated version uses ""punktlos schießt."" ""Punktlos schießen"" literally means ""to shoot without a mark"" and implies that the bullets miss their target. However, the reference translation makes it clear that the person is shot and killed, so a more appropriate verb would be ""erschießt"" as used in the reference.

Overall, the reference and machine-generated versions differ in their use of language, verb tense, and wording. The reference version is more appropriate, clear, and accurate in its use of the target language.

While the machine translation conveys the general meaning of the source text, it contains a few errors and differences compared to the reference translation.

1. Order of elements: In the original English sentence, ""recalling"" a player from the bereavement list and ""optioning"" him to the minor leagues are separate actions. However, the machine translation combines them both in a single clause, making it sound as if the two actions are happening simultaneously.

2. Word usage: ""erinnerte"" (recalled) is not the correct word to use in this context. A better word to use is ""berief"" (recalled in the reference text) or ""zurückberief"" (recalled in the literal sense of the word, meaning to take back or withdraw).

3. Word omission: The word ""in"" is missing in the machine-generated text. The reference text includes the word ""in"" to specify that Luis Avilán is being sent to the Oklahoma City team in the AAA minor-league.

The machine translation uses the preposition ""über"" to mean ""across"" or ""over"" when describing the location of the tornadoes. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the preposition ""in"" to indicate that the tornadoes landed ""in"" or ""within"" the northern region of the Great Plains.

While both translations are grammatically correct, the reference translation is more precise in conveying the location of the tornado touchdowns. The use of ""in"" implies that the tornado.. touched down specifically within the boundaries of the northern region of the Great Plains, whereas the use of ""über"" in the machine translation could be interpreted as occurring somewhere *above* or *over* the region, but not necessarily within its confines.

In the reference translation, the phrase ""ihren Höhepunkt mit Platz"" indicates that the single reached a peak position or ranking on a chart. However, the machine translation only includes ""den Höhepunkt,"" which lacks the specificity of the reference.

Moreover, the term ""Werbe-Single"" in the machine-generated text might not be the best choice, as it implies a promotional single, whereas the reference text refers to it as the ""first promotional single"" (die erste Singleauskopplung).

A careful examination reveals that the only slight discrepancy between the two is the hyphen in ""Massen-repressionen"" in the reference version, which is absent in the machine-generated one.

The hyphen in the reference German version is consistent with the meaning of the English text, as the word ""Massen-repressionen"" refers to multiple instances of repression, each affecting a multitude of people. The hyphen emphasizes that ""Massen-"" is an intensifying adjective for ""Repressionen"" and is essential to convey the meaning of the English correctly.

Additionally, the reference Translation uses the past tense ""geraten könnten"" (might end up) to indicate a hypothetical situation, the machine Translation does not.

Overall, the machine Translation is understandable but lack the nuances and specificity of the reference Translation.

 The machine translation ""OHL übertrug dann Ludendorff, aber Hindenburgs persönliches Plädoyer an den Kaiser vereinigte sie wieder"" is quite close to the reference translation ""OHL übertrug dann Ludendorff, aber Hindenburgs persönliches Plädoyer an den Kaiser brachte sie wieder zusammen"". However, there is one difference in word choice that affects the meaning slightly.

In the source text and reference translation, the verb ""vereinigte"" (which means ""united"" or ""brought together"") is used to describe the effect of Hindenburg's personal plea on Ludendorff. In contrast, the machine translation uses the verb ""vereinigte"" (which means ""united"" or ""combined/merged"").

While the difference in meaning is subtle. ""Vereinigte sie wieder"" implies a stronger sense of reunification, as if the two parties had been previously united and were only temporarily separated. ""Vereinigte sie wieder"" could imply that the two parties had never been together and that the plea brought them together for the first time.

In contrast, the reference translation uses the verb ""brachte...zusammen"" (which means ""brought...together""), which conveys the intended meaning of the original text more accurately.

Therefore, the machine-generated translation differs slightly from the reference in conveying the precise meaning of the original. However, the overall meaning remains clear in the machine-generated version, and the error is relatively minor.

Reference Translation: ""1990 identifizierte die Washington Post New Options as eine von 10 commanders Zeitschriften, die die Überschrift 'The Ideology Huddle' trugen.""

In the reference translation, the word ""commanders"" is used to convey the meaning of ""spearheading"" in the original source. This is a somewhat loose translation, as the word ""commanders"" here implies a sense of authority or direction, whereas ""spearheading"" implies leading or initiating a movement.

In contrast, the machine translation uses the phrase ""die Überschrift 'The Ideology Shuffle' trugen"" to convey the meaning of the original text. This is a more literal translation of the original text, but it may not convey the full meaning of ""spearheading"" as effectively as the reference translation.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are quite close to the original English text, which is a good sign that the essential meaning has been preserved. However, there are a couple of minor differences between the two translations that could be relevant in certain contexts.

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the verb ""ablehnte"" (ablehnte = denied, past tense of ablehnen) appears at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it appears in the middle. In this specific case, both orders are grammatically correct and convey the same meaning. However, the word order in the reference text places slightly more emphasis on the action of denial, while the word order in the machine translation distributes emphasis more evenly across the different parts of the sentence.

2. Punctuation: The reference text includes a period at the end of the sentence, while the machine-generated text does not. In this instance, the lack of a punctuation symbol at the end of the sentence is not a significant issue, but it is worth noting that consistency in punctuation is important for clarity and readability.

Overall, the machine-generated text is quite accurate and conveys the meaning of the English text. However, the reference text is slightly more precise and adheres more closely to standard conventions of German punctuation. Therefore, if I had to choose between the reference and the machine-generated text, I would prefer the reference text. Nevertheless, the differences in this case are relatively minor, and the quality of the machine-generated text is still quite good.

1. Use of quotation marks: The machine.translation includes quotation marks around ""Citizen on Patrol,"" which is not present in the reference. The use of quotation marks in the source text could indicate that ""Citizen on Patrol"" refers to a specific program or title. In the reference, the lack of quotation marks suggests that ""Bürger auf Patrouille"" is simply describing a role, not referring to a specific program.

2. Word order: In the reference, ""dass sie"" (that she) is placed at the beginning of the subordinate clause, while in the machine.translation, ""dass sie"" is placed after the verb ""rekrutieren wollte"" (wanted to recruit). This slight rearragement of the word order in the machine.translation is still grammatically correct, but it might slightly affect the emphasis of the sentence.

3. Use of comma: In the reference, a single comma separates the two subordinate clauses, while the machine.translation includes two separate commas. This is a minor punctuation difference, but it slightly alters the flow of the sentence.

Overall, the machine.translation conveys the intended meaning, but the reference.translation is more accurate and adheres closer to the original text. The reference.translation avoids using quotation marks, follows the correct word order, and includes proper punctuation.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original English source, and both are grammatically correct and convey the same meaning. However, upon closer examination. There is a slight difference between the two translations.

The difference lies in the use of the capitalization of the word ""Mesmerismus"" in the machine-generated version. In the reference version, the word is written with a lower-case ""m"" (Mesmerismus), whereas, in the machine-generated one, it is written with an upper-case ""M"" (Mesmerismus).

Capitalization is an essential aspect of any language, and it can affect the meaning and emphasis of a given word. In this context, the reference version is more accurate, as the word ""Mesmerismus"" refers to a specific practice named after Franz Anton Mesmer, and it is not a proper noun. Therefore, it should be written with a lower-case ""m"".

In summary, the only significant difference between the reference and the machine-generated version is the use of the lower-case and upper-case ""m"" in the word ""Mesmerismus/Mesmerismus"". The reference is more accurate in this case, and the machine-generated one contains a minor error.

A careful comparison reveals that the following translations are correct:

* Kabeljau (cod)
* Schellfisch (haddock)
* Wittling (whiting)
* Scholle (plaice)
* Makrele (mackerel)
* Hering (herring)

However, the following translations have some issues:

* Seelachs is a German term for a different type of fish, typically Pacific cod or Greenland halibut. A more appropriate translation for saithe might be Seewolf.
* Seezunge is a type of halibut or flounder, but it is not a direct translation of sole. A more appropriate translation might be Goldbutt or Kliesche.
* Beutel and Sprotte both refer to different species of herring, but the reference translation specifically uses Franzosendorsch and europäische Sprotte.
* Sandaal is a different species of fish and not a direct translation of sand eel. A better translation might be Sandhai or Sandtier.

Therefore, while the machine translation is mostly correct. A human translator would have chosen more appropriate terms for some of the fish species listed.

One difference is that the machine translation uses the present tense of the verb ""fungieren"" (fungiert), whereas the reference translation uses the past tense of the verb ""fungieren"" (fungierte). Both translations accurately reflect the meaning of the original text, but the use of the present tense in the machine translation might sound slightly less idiomatic to a native German reader.

* ""transcribed"" refers to the action of converting spoken or written dialogue into written form.
* ""sie"" is a feminine third-person plural pronoun, which in this context refers to ""it"" (referring to the text that was transcribed by Brandan, as mentioned in the source text).
* ""so getreu wie möglich"" means ""as accurately/faithfully as possible""
* ""wie er sich daran erinnert"" is a subordinating conjunction that means ""as he recalls/remembers it/that""

The reference Translation ""Brandan hat es so genau wie möglich transkribiert, als er es wieder ins Gedächtnis rief"" can be analyzed as:

* ""Brandan"" is the proper name of the person doing the transcription.
* ""hat transkribiert"" is the past tense of ""transkribieren"" (to transcribe in written form)
* ""es"" refers to the text that was transcribed
* ""so genau wie möglich"" is an adverb that means ""as accurately/detailed as possible""

* ""als"" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a comparison
* ""er "" is a masculine singular pronoun, referring to ""Brandan""
* ""es wieder ins Gedächtnis rief"" is a subclause that means ""recalled it back to memory""

Comparing the machine and reference Translation, the main difference is the wording of the verb tense and the word ""genau"" (exact, detailed, accurate) is missing in the machine Translation.

4. Word usage: The word ""kurassieres"" in the reference is a less common variation of ""kürassiere"" in the machine-generated text.

Overall, the reference text is more accurate and reads more naturally, with proper punctuation, capitalization, and consistent word use. The machine-generated text contains some errors that make it less clear and harder to read.

453	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the English-German translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source text, which is about Galvatron II taking over Megatron's leadership of the Decepticons and demoting him to guard an underground headquarters.

However, there are some differences in wording and style. Here are some of them:

1. Word order: In the machine-generated translation, the verb ""demotivate"" (demotivieren) is placed after its object ""sein Gegenstück"" (his counterpart/opponent). In the reference translation, the verb ""degradieren"" comes before its object ""seinen Gegenpart"" (his counterpart/opponent).

While both translations are grammatical, the reference version sounds more natural and idiomatic in German.

2. Vocabulary: The machine-generated version uses the verb ""an sich reißen"" (to snatch away/grab for oneself/wrest from) to express the idea of taking over the leadership. While this is not incorrect, the reference version chooses the verb ""an sich reißen"" (to seize/grabs for itself/wrest from someone/something) which is more precise and fitting.

3. Register: The reference version uses the more elevated register of ""dahingehend"" (thereupon/in this regard/henceforth) to introduce the demotion of Megatron, while the machine-generated one opts for the simpler ""daraufhin"" (hence/thereupon/as a result/ consequently/thereafter/in that case/in view of that/in the light of this/in the circumstances/in the event/given these facts/in the event of/under those circumstances/in the event of/given that/in the event that/following that/after that/afterwards/thereafter/at that time/later/afterwards/hence/thereafter/afterwards/thereupon/on that

 The source text is a statement about historian Ian Kershaw's characterization of some sermons. According to the source. Kershaw described the sermons as a ""vigorous denunciation of Nazi inhumanity and barbarism.""

The machine and reference translations both translate the phrase ""vigorous denunciation"" as ""energische Denunziation"" in German. This is a suitable translation, as it conveys the strength and intensity of the original phrase.

However, the reference translation includes quotation marks in the translation of ""energische Denunziation,"" indicating that this is a direct quote from Kershaw.

 The machine translation ""Im April 1967 schoss Syrien auf einen israelischen Traktor, der in der entmilitarisierten Zone pflügte, was zu einem Luftangriff vor dem Krieg eskalierte"" is very close to the reference translation ""Im April 1967 schoss Syrien auf einen israelischen Traktor, der in der entmilitarisierten Zone pflügte, was zu einem Luftangriff vor dem Krieg eskalierte."" Both translations accurately convey the source text's message that in April 1967, Syria fired at an Israeli tractor plowing in the demilitarized zone, which led to a prewar air clash.

Upon closer examination, the only difference between the two translations is the absence of a comma in the machine-generated version. In the reference translation, a comma is placed after ""1967 schoss Syrien auf einen israelischen Traktor, der in der entmilitarisierten Zone pflügte,"" whereas the machine-generated version lacks this punctuation.

While this is a minor difference. Proper punctuation can improve readability and clarity in written language. In this specific case, the lack of a comma in the machine-generated version does not significantly detract from the overall meaning or fluency of the text. However, punctuation is an essential aspect of written language and can impact the readability and clarity of a text. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that machine-generated or automated text includes proper punctuation to ensure accurate and clear communication.

In the source text, it is mentioned that Robert greets Enrique on his birthday, while at the same time, Rico and Santino are kidnapped (or abducted) by Robert.

In the machine-generated German text, the word ""flüchtling"" (fleeing/fugitive) is used to describe Robert, whereas the reference text correctly uses ""sich auf der Flucht befindender"" (on the run/fleeing at the moment of the action described in the sentence) to convey the same meaning.

The word ""flüchtling"" implies a more permanent status of fleeing, as opposed to the temporary situation of being on the run in the reference text. Additionally, the reference text correctly states that Rico and Santino are ""abducted"" by Robert, while the machine-generated version implies that Rico and Santino are merely accompanying him.

Overall, the reference text is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original English sentence, and the word choices used in the reference text align more closely with the intended meaning.

However, upon closer examination, the machine-generated translation contains a minor error. In the original English text, the term is described as being derogatory for ""nationalists, especially in Ireland."" In contrast. the machine-generated version translates ""nationalists, especially in Ireland"" as ""nationalisten, insbesondere in Irland.""

The reference and machine-generated versions use the term ""nationalisten"" to refer to ""nationalists"" in the original text. However, the reference version correctly includes the commas to indicate that the reference to ""nationalists, especially in Ireland"" is a parenthetical aside, whereas the machine-generated one does not.

Therefore, the correct and complete machine-generated version of the sentence in question should be:

""Der Begriff 'Sepoy' oder 'Sepoyism' wurde zu einem abfälligen Begriff für, insbesondere in Irland,

nationalists.""

In summary, the only significant discrepancy in the two versions is the lack of a punctuation error in the machine-generated one, which slightly alters the meaning of the sentence. However, the overall meaning remains the same, and the error is minor.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same overall meaning, which is that the person referred to later joins the Thunderbolts in their efforts to assassinate Moon Knight.

However, there is a subtle difference in the way the two translations are constructed. In the machine translation, the infinitive ""ermorden"" (to assassinate) is separated from its direct object ""Mondknight"" (Moon Knight) by the prepositional phrase ""in ihren Bemühungen"" (in their efforts). This can make the sentence sound a bit awkward and unclear about who or what is being assassinated.

In contrast, the reference translation places ""Moon Knight"" immediately after the infinitive, creating a clear and concise sentence structure.

So, the difference between the machine and reference translation is mainly in the word order, with the reference version being more clear and precise.

Here is a revised version of the machine translation that addresses these differences:

Jax sperrt den Club zu, aber Galen schafft es, Wendy aus dem Krankenhaus zu entführen.

(Note: In this explanation, I assume that the source text refers to a fictional scenario where a character named Jax takes measures to secure a club and another character named Galen kidnaps a person named Wendy from a hospital. The tense used in the reference and revised machine translations conveys past actions, consistent with a narration of such a scenario.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are quite close to the original English sentence in meaning. However, there is a slight but important difference between the machine and reference versions in German.

The source sentence states that the ""Tropical Depression Tina dissipated"" after entering the Pacific. The reference German version reflects this meaning by using the verb ""löste sich auf"" (lit. ""dissolved itself""), indicating that the tropical depression broke down or disbanded naturally.

On the other hand, the machine-generated version uses the verb ""verschwand"" (lit. ""disappeared""), which might imply that the tropical depression was no more found in the location, but not necessarily conveying the meaning that it was dissolved naturally.

In summary, the reference and the source sentences convey the correct meaning, but the reference is more precise and accurate in expressing the intended meaning. The difference is subtle, but it is essential to ensure the correct meaning is conveyed. Therefore, the reference version is to be preferred.

The word ""bondholder"" in the source text is translated as ""Bondholder"" in the machine translation, which is a literal and correct rendering of the word. However, the reference translation uses the term ""Anleiheninhaber"" which is a more common and appropriate term in German for a ""bondholder"" in the given context.

Therefore. the difference between the two translations is that the reference German text uses a more appropriate and natural word for ""bondholder"" in the given context, whereas the machine translation uses a literal and correct, but less appropriate word.

In the context of the source sentence, ""umgefüllt"" is a more appropriate translation as it conveys the idea of moving the wine from one place to another (in this case, from the fermenter to the wineskins/amphorae for storage). ""Übertragen"" can also mean ""translate"" or ""transmit"" in addition to ""transfer"" and thus may not convey the correct meaning. Additionally, the reference translation specifies the direction of the pouring, which is not specified in the machine or source text, but is implied in the reference. Therefore, the reference and source share the same meaning, and the machine slightly differs in meaning.

Firstly, the machine translation translates ""Levies"" as ""Abgaben"" which means ""taxes"" or ""contributions"" in English. However, in this context, ""Levies"" refers to military forces raised by a local population, so a more accurate translation would be ""aufgestellte Truppen"" or ""aufgestellte Einheiten"" (meaning ""levied troops"" or ""levied units"").

Both translations accurately convey the original English sentence's meaning, which states that the subject in question follows the path of isobars and approaches the flow above the atmospheric boundary layer in the midlatitudes.

However, a more nuanced analysis reveals that the machine translation accurately translates the individual components of the sentence but fails to replicate the fluency and naturalness of the reference translation. For instance, the machine-generated sentence could benefit from slight revisions to improve readability, such as adding a comma after ""Isobaren"" for clarity. Additionally, the reference translation features hyphenation in ""atmosphärischen Grenzschicht"". While hyphenation is not mandatory in this context, it enhances readability and is a common stylistic choice in formal German writing.

In summary, while the machine and reference translations convey the same meaning. A more rigorous evaluation reveals slight differences in style and fluency. To improve the quality of machine-generated translations, incorporating stylistic elements and refining readability is essential. This evaluation highlights the importance of post-editing, which involves human intervention to ensure fluency, naturalness, and stylistic appropriateness.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original English source sentence. However, upon closer examination.

The source sentence ""Sudha still instructs him about repairing the shoe."" conveys that the action of instructing is ongoing.

The reference German sentence ""Sudha weist ihn immer noch an, den Schuh zu reparieren."" also conveys that the instructing is still in

progress, as indicated by the word ""immer noch.""
The machine-generated sentence, ""Sudha weist ihn immer noch an, den Schuh zu reparieren,"" also conveys that the instructing is still happening.

Therefore, in this particular context, the machine-generated and reference-generated sentences convey the same meaning.

However, it is worth noting that the reference-generated sentence is written with lower-case for the word ""schuh"" (shoe in English) while the

machine-generated one is with a leading upper-case.

Overall, the two generated sentences convey the same meaning as the original, with minor differences in capitalization.

Upon comparison. I found that the machine translation is mostly accurate, as it translates all the ethnic groups mentioned in the original text without any errors.

However, there is one minor difference between the machine and reference translations. In the reference, the word ""Armenian diaspora"" is written as ""Armenische Diaspora"" with a capital ""D"" for ""Diaspora"", while in the machine-generated version, it is ""armenische Diaspora"" with a lower-case ""d"".

A diaspora refers to a group of people who live outside their traditional homeland but maintain ties to their country of origin. In this context, Armenian is referring to people of Armenian descent or origin.

Capitalizing the first letter of the word ""Diaspora"" is a matter of style and convention. In formal or academic writing, it is common to capitalize proper nouns, including the first letter of the word ""Diaspora"" in this context.

Overall, the difference between the two versions is minor, and the meaning of the text is not significantly altered. However, it is essential to ensure consistency and correctness, especially in professional or academic writing. Therefore, the reference version with the proper noun convention is preferable.

Both translations convey the meaning of the original English sentence, but the reference version opts for a verb that slightly softens the sense of strict habitation, suggesting that the animals merely live or exist near the lake, as opposed to specifically inhabiting or residing in its periphery.

In this case, neither the machine-generated nor the reference-provided version contains glaring errors, but the reference one is more naturally phrased and aligns more closely with the nuances of the original English. Therefore, the reference-provided ""leben"" is a better fit for the original meaning, as it avoids the potential implication that the reptiles and amphibians inhabit the entire perimeter of the lake.

When comparing the two translations to the reference, it is apparent that the machine-generated version is accurate. The meaning of the original text is preserved, and the grammatical structure of the sentence is correct.

However, it is important to note that the accuracy of a single sentence or phrase cannot be taken as a definitive measure of the overall quality of a machine-generated English-to-German or any other language pair.

A thorough evaluation of a machine-generated English-to-German or other-language-pair system typically involves analyzing a representative sample of sentences, assessing the fluency and naturalness of the generated text, and evaluating the grammatical and factual correctness of the generated sentences.

In summary, the machine-generated and reference-provided versions of the given sentence convey the same meaning, and the difference in the first letter of the first word is a minor one. However, a more extensive evaluation of the overall quality of the system is necessary to assess the reliability and usefulness of the generated text.

The main difference is in the wording used to describe the role of the person when they pitched. The machine translation uses the word ""erleichterung"" which means relief, while the reference translation uses the term ""Relief Pitcher"". The reference translation is more accurate as it specifically refers to a role in baseball, which is not clear from the use of the word ""erleichterung"" alone.

Additionally, the reference translation uses the phrase ""aus dem Verkehr zogen"" to describe the action taken by the team to shut him down, while the machine translation uses the word ""stilllegen"" with the same meaning. While both phrases convey the same meaning, the reference translation is more commonly used and more natural-sounding in this context.

Overall, the machine translation conveys the meaning of the original text, but the reference translation is more precise and sounds more natural in the target language.

However, it is important to note that the term ""glabella"" in the original English sentence is not a standard English term and may not have a direct equivalent in German. The reference German translation uses the loanword ""Glabella"" which is not commonly used in everyday language. A more appropriate and commonly used German term for ""glabella"" is ""Stirn"" or ""Stirnhöhle"" (for the bony part above the eyebrows).

Therefore. a more accurate and commonly used German translation for the original English sentence ""The glabella forms a dome underneath which sat the ""crop"" or ""stomagen"""" could be:

 The machine translation correctly translated most of the source text, but there are a few differences when compared to the reference translation.

* ""Chinesische"" should be ""chinesisches"" in the machine translation, as the adjective should agree in gender and number with the following noun ""Zentrum"" (Center).
* The word ""für"" is missing in the machine translation, which is present in the reference translation.

Here's the corrected version of the machine translation:

1993 ""Sui Jianguo und Wang Keping Skulptur-Ausstellung"", chinesisches modernes Kunst-Zentrum, Osaka, Japan

Overall, the machine translation is understandable, but the minor errors make it less accurate and less fluent compared to the reference.

Firstly, the machine translation uses the phrase ""brennende Tod"" which literally translates to ""burning death/death by fire"" while the reference translation uses ""Tod"" which simply means ""death"" and adds more context by including ""bei einem Brandbombenangriff"" which means ""by a firebomb attack/firebombing incident.""

Second, the reference translation specifies that Vernon Dahmer, the NAACP leader, died during a ""Brandbombenangriff"" (firebomb attack/firebomb incident) whereas the machine translation does not specify the cause of death, only using the word ""brennende"" (burning/on-fire) to describe the event.

Overall, the reference-quality human-made German-language version of the English-language source is more precise and informative, and it is important to note that the wording and phrasing of the reference-level version are more appropriate for conveying the intended meaning.

 The machine Translation ""Im November 1928 absorbierte Nu Beta die Theta Beta Rho Fraternität."" is different from the reference Translation ""Im November 1928 übernahm Nu Beta die Bruderschaft Theta Beta Rho."" in the verb used to describe the action taken by Nu Beta.

In the machine Translation, the verb ""absorbed"" is used, while in the reference Translation, the verb ""übernahm"" which means ""took over or acquired"" is used.

In the context of the source text, which states that Nu Beta ""absorbed"" the Theta Beta Rho Fraternity in November 1928, the appropriate verb to use would be one that conveys a sense of taking in or incorporating, rather than simply absorbing.

The Reference Translation correctly uses ""übernahm"" to convey the idea that Nu Beta took over or acquired the fraternity, as opposed to simply incorporating it. Therefore, the machine Translation is less accurate than the reference Translation.

However, there is a slight but significant difference between the two. In the machine-generated Translation, the word ""Szene"" (which means ""scene"" in English) is placed **after** ""Lewis Chairman of the Board"" and is separated by a comma, making it sound as if ""Szene"" is referring to a standalone element, whereas in the reference Translation, the word ""Szene"" is placed **after** the colon and is directly connected to ""Lewis' 'Chairman of the Board' "" which makes it clear that ""Szene"" is referring to the scene from The Errand Boy.

The reference Translation is more accurate and clear in this case, as it emphasizes the specific scene that Peter is recreating. Therefore, the machine Translation is different from the reference Translation in a subtle but important way.

The word ""Streichung"" in the machine-generated translation means ""brush, rub, or stroke over (a surface), typically in order to clean or polish it gently."" While this is not an entirely incorrect translation, it conveys a slightly different meaning from the original ""petting session"" and the reference German ""Streichelstunde"" (lit. ""caress-/pet-hour/time/session"").

The reference German version correctly uses ""Streichelstunde"" to refer to a specific, scheduled time for visitors to interact with the beluga, as reported in the source. Therefore, the reference version is more accurate in conveying the nuance of the original English sentence.

In summary, the primary difference between the two translations is the nuance of the word ""petting"" in the original and the slightly different meaning of ""Streichung"" in the machine-generated version. The reference version correctly captures the meaning of the original with the use of ""Streichelstunde"".

1. The machine-generated translation incorrectly uses ""emigrated to Norway"" instead of ""immigrated to Norway"" or ""wanderte...nach Norwegen aus."" Emigration refers to leaving one's own country to live in another, while immigration refers to entering and residing in a new country. In this context, the correct term is ""immigrated to Norway"" or ""wanderte...nach Norwegen aus"" in German.

However, there is a minor difference between the two translations. The machine translation uses by convention by the machine by ""führt zur Freisetzung von Kortikosterioden und Aldosteron aus der Nebennieren-Drüse"" (literally: ""leads to the release of corticosteroids and aldosterone from the adrenal gland-druse""), while the reference human translation uses ""induziert die Freisetzung"" (literally: ""induces the release of"").

In this context, ""führen zur Freisetzung"" and ""induzieren die Freisetzung"" can be considered equivalent translations of ""induces the release of"" in the original English sentence.

Upon closer examination. there are no significant differences between the machine and reference translations. The grammatical structures and word choices used in the two translations are very similar, and both convey the intended meaning clearly and accurately.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are identical in this case, which means that the machine accurately translated the English sentence ""Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience"" into German as ""Spielberg schrieb viele Probleme seinem Perfektionismus und seiner Unerfahrenheit zu."" This suggests that the machine was able to understand and translate the original English text into correct and fluent-sounding German.

However, it is still important to evaluate the quality of the machine's work beyond just comparing the source and target texts. In particular, it is important to consider whether the grammar, syntax, and word choice of the target text are appropriate and accurate.

In this case, the grammar and syntax of the target text appear to be correct. The verb ""schrieb"" is in the past tense, consistent with the original English sentence, and the word order is logical and clear. Additionally, the words ""viele Probleme"" (many problems) and ""seinem Perfektionismus und seiner Unerfahrenheit"" (his perfectionism and his inexperience) are used appropriately and accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.

Overall, the quality of the machine's work appears to be high, and it has accurately translated the English sentence while preserving the intended meaning and tone. However, it is still important to carefully evaluate the accuracy and fluency of the target text in any given case, as there may be subtle differences or errors that are not immediately apparent.

The source text states that Barnwell ""complained bitterly"" about his troubles, while both the machine and reference translations render this as ""beklagte sich bitter"" about his problems. Here, the choice of words used to express the idea of complaining or expressing dissatisfaction is slightly different. While ""befallen"" can imply making a complaint. ""bemängeln or kritisieren ""could also be used to express the idea of expressing dissatisfaction.

Additionally, the word ""all"" is used in the source text to describe the troubles that Barnwell had, but is not included in either the machine or reference-translated text. Depending on the context, the inclusion of ""all"" in the target text might be necessary to convey the full meaning of the original.

Finally, the word ""with them"" from the original source is included in the machine and reference-translated text, but its meaning might not be entirely clear in the target language. Depending on the context, ""with them"" might refer to specific people or a group of people that Barnwell was having troubles with.

Overall, the machine and reference-translated texts convey the same meaning as the original, but the word choices and phrasing used might not be an exact match.

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the verb ""fügte hinzu"" is placed immediately after ""Smith,"" while in the reference translation, the verb ""trug zur Legende bei"" is placed after linking the two actions with ""und.""

2. Word usage: In the machine translation, the term ""lore"" is used in the original English sentence, but in the reference translation, it is translated as ""Fluch"" (curse).

3. Preposition: In the reference translation, the preposition ""beim"" is used to indicate ""at the"" in the context of the event, but the machine fails to translate it.

However, there are some differences when compared to the reference translation, which is the commonly accepted and idiomatic way of expressing the idea in German.

One key difference is the verb ""interferes"" in the source text, which is translated as ""griff ein"" in the machine translation. While both translations convey the idea. ""Stört"" is a more common and natural way to express the interfering nature of geometry in croquet in German.

The reference translation correctly uses ""stört"" to convey the meaning of the English verb ""interferes"" and maintains the active voice in the sentence, which is closer to the original meaning and tone of the English sentence.

In contrast, the machine translation uses the passive voice ""greift ein"" (literally: ""intervenes""), which can change the meaning slightly and may imply that the interference is intentional or purposeful, which is not the intended meaning in the original sentence.

Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding in expressing the original meaning, and the machine translation has some minor issues with verb selection and grammatical structure.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close in their wording. However, there is a subtle but significant difference between the two in their use of the pronoun ""it"" in the context of the source text.

In the source text, the phrase ""General Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group A, also disagreed with **it**."" implies that there was a previous statement or proposal that both the subject of the sentence and ""General Gerd von Rundstedt"" disagreed with.

However, neither the machine nor the reference translation includes any mention of this previous statement or proposal. The pronoun ""it"" is simply dropped in the machine and reference translation, with the sentence focusing solely on the disagreement of ""General Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander of the Army Group A.""

While this omission does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence, it is a difference between the source and the two translations.

The reference German sentence expresses the same idea, but with a slightly different grammatical structure. Instead of using a gerund phrase, it separates the action of ""waterskiing"" into a separate clause, with the verb ""fährt"" (drives/goes waterskiing in this context) and the adverb ""mit Doll"" (with Doll in this context) expressing the same idea.

The machine-generated sentence is not incorrect, but it may sound less fluent to a native or proficient German reader, as the verb-first word order of the gerund phrase is more characteristic of English. The reference sentence, with its separate verb and subject, may flow more naturally in a sentence written in a more typically Germanic word order.

Overall, the difference between the two sentences is subtle, and the meaning conveyed is the same. However, the reference sentence is more in line with the conventions of the target language, and thus is a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the intended meaning.

The machine translation follows the word order of the source text more closely, with ""sie"" (them) appearing after the verb ""trieben"" (drove back). The reference translation, on the other hand, places ""sie"" (them) earlier in the sentence, before ""entscheidende Niederlagen"" (decisive defeats).

The reference translation is more faithful to the original English wording, which places the pronoun ""them"" earlier in the sentence, between the subjects ""Bahram V and Yazdegerd II"" and the verb ""drove back.""

Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate in this case, as it preserves the original wording and meaning more closely. The machine translation is still understandable and conveys the intended meaning, but it may sound slightly less fluent to a native-German reader.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, as both convey the same meaning that the Bengali celebrations, which are celebrated by Bengalis of all faiths, include the Bengali New Year, Spring Festival, and Authttern Festivals.

However, there is a minor difference in the word order between the two translations. In the reference translation, ""the Bengali celebrations, which are celebrated by Bengalis of all faiths, include"" is translated as ""Sie werden von Bengalen aller Glaubensrichtungen gefeiert und umfassen."" This results in a slight rearragement of the sentence structure compared to the original English sentence.

In contrast, the machine translation translates the original sentence more literally as ""celebrated by Bengalis of all faiths, they include the bengalischem Neujahr, the Springfest and the Herbsterntefest.""

While both translations convey the same meaning. The reference version is more fluent and reads more naturally. The machine version is slightly less fluent due to the literal word-for-word style of the sentence structure.

Therefore, the machine version is not as good as the reference one, but it is still understandable and conveys the intended meaning.

However, the verb ""rewir"" ( salvage in the machine and salvage in the reference) is not a direct equivalent to the word ""salvaging"" in the original text. A more accurate rendering of the word ""salvaging"" in the context of the sentence might be ""instandsetzen"" or ""wiederherstellen"" in German.

However. there are some differences in wording and emphasis between the two translations.

* The machine-generated version uses ""Durch Oxidation"" (through oxidation) as the opening phrase, while the reference version has ""Ihr Glanz wird an der Luft"" (their shine in the air). The reference version focuses more on the change in the object's appearance, while the machine-generated one emphasizes the cause of the change.

Firstly, the term ""Lecks"" in the machine translation is a mistranslation of the English word ""lechery"" in the source text. A more accurate translation of ""lechery"" into German would be ""Unzucht"" or ""Unmoralischkeit,"" which both convey a sense of licentious or immoral behavior.

Secondly, the verb form ""bewahrte"" used in the machine-generated text is not entirely accurate. A more precise verb would be ""beschützte"" or ""schützte,"" both of which convey the sense of actively protecting or guarding.

Here are the specific areas where the machine translation deviates from the reference translation:

1. Capitalization: In the machine translation, ""earldom"" is not capitalized, while in the reference translation, ""Grafschaft"" is capitalized. Capitalization is an important aspect of German grammar, and failure to capitalize nouns can change the meaning of a sentence. In this case, the capitalized ""Grafschaft"" refers to a county or earldom, while the lowercase ""earldom"" refers to the position or title of an earl.
2. Word order: In the machine translation, the word order is ""Das Mote trug noch die Würde des earldom,"" while in the reference translation, it is ""Der Moot Hill trug noch die Würde des Grafschaft."" Here, the reference translation correctly inverts the word order of the machine translation to follow the standard SOV (subject-object-verb) structure of German sentences.
3. Word choice: In the machine translation, ""mote"" is used to translate ""the dignity of the earldom."" While ""mote"" is a valid English word, it is not the correct translation here. In the reference translation, ""Moot Hill"" is used, which is a more accurate rendering of the original English sentence.
4. Gender and number agreement: In the reference translation, the definite article ""der"" is used before ""Moot Hill,"" indicating that ""Moot Hill"" refers to a single, masculine noun. In the machine-generated version, the definite article is missing, which can lead to confusion or misunderstanding.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and closely reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The machine-generated version contains several errors in grammar, word usage, and word order, which can lead to confusion or misunderstanding.

The reference German text. ""Exhumationen können auch als Teil von Grabraub oder als Akt der Entweihung auftreten, um Missachtung zu zeigen.""

The source and reference texts are identical in meaning and convey the idea of exhumations being carried out as part of a theft of a grave or an act of desecration to show disrespect.

The machine-generated text is also very similar to the reference, with the exception of the word ""Grabraub"" (grave-robbing) being written as ""Grabraub"" (literally, ""grave theft"") in the reference.

Overall, the machine-generated text is accurate and conveys the intended meaning, with the minor discrepancy of the word ""Grabraub"" being written as ""Grabraub"" in the reference.

However, it is important to note that the reference and the source texts use the word ""Exhumationen"" (exhumations) and ""Grabraub"" (grave-robbing) in the same sentence, which could imply a direct link between the two.

The machine-generated text does not make this direct link explicit, and it is possible that the meaning of the sentence is slightly different in the reference compared to the source.

However, there is one difference in the word used for ""wickets"". The word used in the machine translation is ""Pforten"" (gates), while the reference text uses the correct word ""Wickets"".

This mistake occurs because the word ""wicket"" in the source text is homograph, meaning it has more than one possible meaning. In the context of the game of cricket, ""wicket"" refers to the wooden structure that the batsman must prevent from falling. The word ""wicket"" is also used in the English language to refer to a gate, door, or other opening, which is the meaning conveyed by the word ""Pforte"" in the machine-generated text.

To avoid this mistake, the system used for the automatic generation of the text should have been able to recognize the specific meaning of the word ""wicket"" in the context of the game of cricket, and therefore use the appropriate word in the target language. However, the system failed to recognize the meaning of the word in the context, and generated a word that is not appropriate in the target language.

In summary, the difference between the reference and the automatic text is the word used for ""wicket"" in the target language.

However, there is a difference in the punctuation used in the two translations. The reference translation separates the phrases ""die fünf nördlichsten Provinzen Zentralvietnams"" and ""die 1. und 2. Division"" with a comma, while the machine translation uses a semicolon.

2. ""Beleidigung"" (assault or offense in a negative sense) is used in the machine-generated text, but the correct word is ""Offensive"" (offense in a positive sense, as in a sports context).

The reference text correctly uses ""Karte"" and ""Offensiven"" to refer to the diagram and the sports term, respectively.

In the reference version, the word ""Arians/Ariern"" lacks an article, which is mandatory in the target language (in this case, ""vor die Arians/Ariern"").

The article is crucial in conveying the meaning correctly, as it distinguishes between ""the Arians/the Arian party/faction/sect"" (with the article) and ""the Arian heresy/theology/ideas/concepts/doctrines/beliefs system/ideas of Arianism"" (without the article).

The reference and the source text use the word ""Arians"" to refer to the followers of the Arian theology, so the article is unnecessary.

The reference text is correct, but the article-less ""Arians/Ariern"" is more idiomatic and precise in this specific case.

The machine-generated text is thus more accurate in this instance, as it correctly reflects the meaning of the original text.

In summary, the reference and the machine-generated text slightly differ in the word ""Arians/Ariern"" (with or without the article ""the/die/der/den/etc.""). The reference omits the article, while the machine-generated one is more precise and accurate in this specific instance.

 The machine translation ""Viele Schnellstraßen und Parkhäuser in den Vororten von New York City wurden Anfang der 1970er Jahre mit bis zu 65 mph gebucht."" has some differences when compared to the reference translation ""Auf vielen Schnellstraßen und Alleen in den Vororten von New York City galt Anfang der 1970er Jahre eine Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung von bis zu 65 mph.""

Here are the main differences:

1. Verb tense: In the machine-generated text, the verb ""wurden"" is used in the past tense, indicating that the expressways and parkways were posted with a speed limit of up to 65mph. However, the reference text uses the passive form ""galt"" in the past tense, meaning that a speed limit of up to 65mph was in effect on many expressways and parkways in the suburbs of New York City.
2. Word usage: The word ""gebucht"" in the machine-generated text is not appropriate in this context. ""Buchung"" usually refers to making a reservation or a booking. A more appropriate word to use in this context is ""angebracht"" or ""angezeigt"" (indicating that the speed limit signs were put up or displayed on the expressways and parkways in the suburbs of New York City in the early 1970s).

Here is a corrected version of the sentence that aligns more closely with the reference text:

""Viele Schnellstraßen und Parkhäuser in den Vororten von New York City hatten Anfang der 1970er Jahre eine zulässige Höchstgeschwindigkeit von bis zu 65 mph."" (Many expressways and parkways in the suburbs of New York City had a maximum allowable speed of up to 65mph in the early 1970s.)

 Both the machine translation and the reference Translation from English to German for the sentence ""The number of premolars, incisors and canines decreased"" are quite similar.

The only minor difference is that in the machine-generated version, there is an additional pair of commas in ""Die Zahl der Prämolaren, Schneidezähne und Eckzähne sank.""

In the reference version, the sentence reads ""Die Zahl der Prämolaren, Schneidezähne und Eckzähne sank."" which is identical, sans the extra commas.

The addition of commas in the list separates each item unnecessarily. The reference version is more appropriate as it correctly conveys the meaning that the total number of all three types of teeth decreased.

Therefore, the reference Translation is preferable to the machine-generated one in this case.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original English sentence in meaning and structure. However, upon closer examination, there is one difference between the two translations.

In the machine translation, the article ""der"" is used before ""Timpanist,"" whereas in the reference translation, the article ""der"" is used before ""Paukist."" by ""Paukist"" refers to a person who plays the timpani, whereas ""der Timpanist"" refers to a professional musician who plays the timpani as their primary instrument.

In this context, the use of ""Paukist"" in the reference translation implies that the person tuning the drum is a professional musician, whereas the use of ""der Timpanist"" in the machine translation is more general and can refer to anyone who plays the timpani, regardless of their level of expertise.

Overall, the difference between the two translations is minor and does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. However, it is essential to choose the appropriate word when communicating with a specific audience, especially when dealing with a specialized field such as music.

 both translations convey the same meaning, namely that Alpha Phi Alpha took part in the March of Dimes' WalkAmerica and raised over $181,000 in 2006.

One minor difference is the use of quotation marks in the reference translation, which is not present in the machine translation. Quotation marks can be used in german language to mark a term or phrase that is borrowed from another language, in this case ""WalkAmerica"" is an english term.

It's also worth noting that the use of punctuation and capitalization slightly differ between german and english, but this does not impact the overall meaning of the sentence.

 Both the machine and reference translations are very close in their rendering of the source text, which is unsurprising given that the name ""Evelyn Barbirolli"" and the phrase ""britische Oboistin"" (British oboist) are identical in both. The crucial difference between the machine and reference versions is the word order of the final clause, specifically ""Ehefrau von Sir John Barbirolli"" (wife of Sir John Barbirolli) in the machine version and ""verheiratet [with] Sir John Barbirolli"" in the reference.

The reference version uses the German verb ""verheiratet"" (married to, in the participial form ""verheiratet"") to indicate Evelyn Barbirolli's spousal relationship to Sir Barbirolli, while the machine version opts for the more literal ""Ehefrau von"" (wife of). While neither is incorrect, the reference's use of ""verheiratet"" is more idiomatic and natural in everyday use, as it avoids the formality of ""Ehefrau von Sir John Barbirolli"" and the repetition of ""Barbirolli"" in the same sentence.

Therefore, the reference is to be preferred to the machine version in this instance.

 The machine translation ""Eine Umfrage von Sportlern wählte die Commodores zum besten Team im Süden und verlieh ihnen die Champ Pickens Trophy"" differs from the reference translation in a few ways.

First, the subject of the sentence in the machine translation is ""Umfrage"" (survey or poll), whereas in the reference translation, the subject is ""eine Umfrage unter Sportjournalisten"" (a poll of sportswriters or journalists in this context).

Second, the verb tense in the machine translation is in simple past, whereas the reference translation is in present perfect tense.

Thus, a more accurate and idiomatic English-to-German translation of the original English sentence that takes these nuances into account is: ""In einer Umfrage unter Sportjournalisten wurden die Commodores zum besten Team im Süden gewählt und man überreichte ihnen die Champ Pickens Trophy.""

The subtle differences in wording and verb tense in the two German sentences, while seemingly minor, can lead to differences in meaning and emphasis. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider each individual word and phrase in the original English sentence and choose the most appropriate and nuanced equivalent in the target language.

The word ""borrowed"" in the English sentence is translated to ""borgten"" in the machine and reference translation, but the word ""borgten"" is not used commonly. ""ausliehen"" is a more common word for ""borrowed"" in German. However, in this specific case, ""borgten"" is correct and accepted in formal and informal writing.

The machine-generated translation reads: ""Die Karneval Antiguan und Barbudan ersetzten 1957 das Weihnachtsfest der Alten Zeit mit der Hoffnung, den Tourismus anzuregen.""

The reference human-generated, professional translation is: ""Der Karneval auf Antigua and Barbuda ersetzte 1957 das Weihnachtsfest der Alten Zeit mit der Hoffnung, den Tourismus anzukurbeln.""

1. Definite article: The reference text includes the definite article ""der Alten Zeit"" (of old time) in contrast to the indefinite article ""der"" (the) in the machine-generated text.

The definite article is more appropriate in this context, as it refers to a specific Christmas tradition that was replaced.

2. Conjugation: The verb ""anzukurbeln"" (to stimulate, to boost, to promote) is correctly used in the reference text, but the verb ""anzuregen"" (to excite, to invite, to address) is used in the machine-generated text.

3. Preposition: The reference text correctly states ""auf"" (on, at) in contrast to the machine-generated ""in"" (in, into, during) in the description of the location of the event.

2. Word form: ""neuen mexikanische"" is incorrect, it should be ""neuen mexikanischen""

3. Word order: ""At the same time, plants like conifers, cordaites, cycads and horsetails, made the New Mexican landscape green.""

* The word ""greened"" in the source is not directly translated in the reference and machine, it is implied in the reference and in the machine it is ""gliederten"" which is not correct in this context.

* The word ""landschaft"" in the reference is more accurate than ""mexikanische Landschaft"" in the machine, as the latter implies a specific type of landscape, not the new one.

* The word ""gleichzeitig"" in the source and the reference is not in the same position, in the reference it is at the beginning of the sentence, in the source it is at the end.

* The word ""pflanzen"" in the reference is more accurate as it is a collective noun for the different types of plants mentioned, in the machine it is ""pflanzen"" as well, but it is not clear if it is a collective or singular.

* The word ""neuen"" in the reference is more accurate as it is a more specific word for ""new"" in this context, in the machine it is ""neue"" which is a more general word for ""new""

* The word ""mexikanische"" in the reference is more accurate as it is a more specific word for ""Mexico"" in this context, in the machine it is ""mexikanische"" as well, but it is not clear if it is a specific or general reference to ""Mexico""

* The word ""at the same time "" in the reference is not in the same position, in the reference it is at the beginning of the sentence, in the source it is at the end.

* The word ""pflanzen"" in the reference is more accurate as it is a collective noun for the different types of plants mentioned, in the machine it is ""pflanzen"" as well, but it is not clear if it is a collective or singular.

* The word ""neuen"" in the reference is more accurate as it is a more specific word for ""new"" in this context, in the machine it is ""neue"" which is a more general word for ""new""

 The source English text describes fumes from glue factories blowing upwind into Brownsville.

The machine German translation mentions that smoke from the glue factories would usually blow upwind into Brownsville.

The reference German text, however, states that smoke from the glue factories along Jamaica Bay would usually stream/flow towards Brownsville against the wind.

The main difference between the machine and reference German text is the verb used to describe the movement of the fumes. The verb ""blasen"" (to blow or to puff) in the machine text implies that the fumes are actively being blown, while the verb ""stromen"" (to stream, to flow) in the reference text implies that the fumes move in a particular direction due to the force of the wind.

Moreover, the reference text explicitly mentions that the wind is blowing against the direction of the fumes, which is not mentioned in the machine text.

Overall, the reference text is a more accurate and precise reflection of the original English text compared to the machine text.

At first glance, the machine and reference-based German texts look identical. However, upon closer examination, the difference lies in the spelling of ""lascarins"" in the English text, which is spelled as ""Lascarine"" in the provided reference and machine-generated text.

The word ""lascarins"" in the English text refers to a type of infantry soldier in the service of the King of France, also known as the Swiss Guard. The reference and machine-generated text use the correct spelling of ""Lascarinen"" in the target language, which is the correct spelling in the context of the text.

Therefore, the only significant difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the consistent spelling of ""Lascarinen"" in the target text, as opposed to the English spelling of ""lascarins"" in the original.

Overall, the quality of the machine-generated text is good, and the minor spelling discrepancy is unlikely to impact the meaning of the text. However, it is essential to ensure that the target text accurately reflects the intended meaning of the original, and minor discrepancies, such as the one observed, can be misleading. Therefore, it is crucial to review and correct the target text to ensure its accuracy and avoid confusion.

A careful evaluation of the context reveals that the word ""cinema"" here refers to the ""Iranian cinema industry/sector/community/etc."" and the correct word to use here is ""unorganized/unorganisiert"" as reflected in the reference German text.

The word ""disorganized/desorganisiert"" implies that the entities involved lack order and structure in their individual capacities, while ""unorganized/unorganisiert"" implies that the entities lack a collective, over-arching organization.

In this case, the reference text is more accurate as it conveys the correct meaning of the Farsi word used in the original text. Therefore, the reference text should be preferred over the machine-generated text.

The primary difference lies in the nuance of the verb being used. The machine-generated version uses the verb ""feierten"" (celebrated), while the reference version opts for ""anbeten"" (worshipped/venerated).

In the given context, the word ""Diana"" refers to the Roman goddess of the hunt, forests, and childbirth. The early inscriptions depict her as a patron of hunters, and the appropriate verb to reflect this concept is ""anbeten"" (worship/venerate) as used in the reference version.

Using the verb ""feierten"" (celebrated) in the machine-generated version is not entirely incorrect, but it is less precise and lacks the depth of meaning that the reference conveys. The word ""feierten"" generally implies a joyful, festive occasion, whereas the concept of ""Diana as a patron of hunters"" is more akin to a solemn, respectful veneration.

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the verb ""feuerten"" (feuded) is placed before the name of the person or team being feuded with, ""Ric Flair"", whereas in the reference translation, the verb ""kämpften"" (fought) is placed after the name of the person or team being fought, ""Ric Flair"".

2. Preposition: In the machine translation, the word ""mit"" (with) is used before the name of the person or team being fought with, ""Ric Flair"", whereas in the reference translation, the word ""gegen"" (against) is used.

3. Word omission: The word ""gegen"" (against) is not included in the machine translation, but it is present in the reference translation.

The machine's English-to-German Translation:

* The German sentence correctly conveys the meaning of the English sentence, with the exception of the word ""Tribünenbestuhlung"" (bleacher seating in a literal sense, but in a broader sense, it can refer to any type of spectator/audience sitting in a sports setting, such as a stadium or field, as in the reference text ""Tribünenbestuhlung"").

* The reference text also correctly conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, with the exception of the word ""unterstellte Unterstände"" (covered dug-ins or dug-ins with a shelter, as opposed to the more literal ""covered dug-outs"" in the machine-generated text).

In summary, the main difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the use of slightly different words to convey the same meaning. The reference text is slightly more precise in its word choice, but the meaning of the two texts is essentially the same.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original English text, as they both accurately convey the same information. However, there is one subtle difference between the two translations.

The difference lies in the use of the preposition ""über"" in the machine translation, which implies that the subjects ""Cunningham and Rawnsley"" traveled ""over"" or ""across"" the listed locations. In contrast, the reference translation correctly uses the preposition ""über"" only for the first location, ""Malta,"" and omits it for the remaining locations, as the original English sentence only implies that the subjects flew ""out to"" or ""to"" those locations.

Here are the relevant exerpts of the respective sentences for comparison:

Source: Cunningham and Rawnsley flew out to Rangoon via Malta, Cairo, Baghdad and Karachi.

Machine Translation: Cunningham und Rawnsley flogen über Malta, Kairo, Bagdad und Karachi nach Rangun.

Reference Translation: Cunningham und Rawnsley flogen über Malta, Kairo, Bagdad und Karachi nach Rangun.

As you can see, the reference and the source text use the same wording, whereas the machine-generated version slightly differs in meaning, although the overall meaning remains clear. Therefore, the reference and the source can be considered more accurate in this specific instance.

 The machine translation ""Fünf Bowler teilten sich die Dochte, Johnston und Loxton nehmen drei pro Stück"" slightly differs from the reference translation ""Fünf Bowler teilten sich die Pforten, Johnston und Loxton nahmen drei pro Stück"".

The main difference is in the translation of the phrase ""bowlers shared the wickets"". Both the machine and reference translations use different words for ""bowlers"" and ""wickets/gates"" - ""Fünf Bowler"" and ""die Pforten"" respectively. However, the main issue is with the word ""shared"" - ""teilten"" in the machine and ""nahmen"" in the reference.

The word ""shared the wickets"" implies that the five bowlers split the task of taking the wickets equally. The reference correctly interprets this with the verb ""nahmen"" (took) and the phrase ""drei pro Stück"" (three per piece/each).

The machine, however, interprets the word ""teilten"" (shared/distributed) as splitting the wickets, which is not accurate. The word ""teilten"" is more appropriate for splitting something physical, not a task.

Overall, the reference is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text.

The verb used in the reference translation is ""umstrukturiert"" which means ""restructured"" or ""reorganized"" in English. However, the verb used in the machine translation is ""reorganisiert"" which also means ""reorganized"" in English.

While both words convey the same meaning, the nuance is slightly different. The word ""umstrukturiert"" implies a more extensive and comprehensive reorganization, involving a significant overhaul of the existing structure. The word ""reorganisiert"" simply means to put something in a different order or arrangement, but not necessarily involving a complete redesign of the existing system.

In this context, the word ""reorganisiert"" in the machine translation slightly under-conveys the meaning of the reference translation, as the reference text implies a more extensive and thorough reorganization of the militias and RWAFF-battalions.

## Only Sentencecz

As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I am committed to providing accurate and unbiased information. Therefore, I am unable to evaluate the quality of a service like ""Only Sentencecz"" without more information.

However, I can say that the name ""Only Sentencecz"" is not a well-known brand or company in the field of language Translation, and it is important to use reputable and reliable language-translation services when conducting important or sensitive communications.

In any case, the evaluation of a language-translation service requires careful consideration of several factors, including the accuracy, fluency, cultural appropriateness, and context-sensitivity of the Translations produced. A thorough evaluation should also consider the source and target languages involved, as well as the expertise and experience of the Translation team.

Therefore, I would recommend conducting a thorough evaluation of ""Only Sentencecz"" or any other language-translation service based on these criteria before making a final assessment.

One difference is that the machine-generated translation inverts the order of the preposition ""between April and August 1989"" to ""zwischen April und August 1989,"" which is a valid translation but could potentially sound more natural to a native speaker in the original word order.

A more significant discrepancy is in the treatment of the phrase ""twenty theatres.""

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the source text, and they essentially convey the same meaning. However, there is a subtle difference between the two translations by the machine and the reference.

The difference lies in the word ""freedmen"" which is used in the source to refer to the former slaves in the United States after the Civil War. In the reference translation, the word ""freie Schwarze"" (literally ""free blacks/Negroes/African-Americans/Blacks"") is used, which is more precise and specific to the context.

 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is in the word ""akritisches"" which was translated from the source ""acrid"" and the word ""scharfes"" which is in the reference translation.

Acrid means sharp or bitter in taste or smell, or harsh or corrosive in effect.

The main difference is in the verb tenses used to describe Louis Wolfson's involvement in breeding and racing in 1978. In the reference translation, the verbs ""züchtete"" and ""fuhr"" are used in past tense to indicate that the actions occurred in the past. However, in the machine translation, the verbs ""gezüchtet"" and ""gezüchtet"" are used, which are also in the past tense, but imply that the action of breeding and racing was continuous or repeated.

Additionally, the preposition ""in"" is used incorrectly in the machine translation.

However, the main difference between the two translations is in the way the verb ""klopft"" is used. The machine has translated ""knocks the gun"" as ""klopft die Waffe aus Sivanas Händen"", which literally means ""knocks the weapon out of Sivana's hands"".

On the other hand, the reference version has used the verb ""schlägt die Waffe aus Sivanas Händen"", which literally means ""knocks the weapon out of Sivana's hands "" as well, but it is more accurate to use ""klopfen "" in this case, as it is more appropriate to express the action of taking the gun away from the person, not just knocking it away.

So, the reference version is more accurate in this case, as it conveys the meaning of the action more precisely.

Moreover, the reference version also slightly rephrases the first part of the sentence, ""He dodges a ray from Sivana"" to ""Er weicht einem Strahl von Sivana aus"", which is more idiomatic and more appropriate for the context.

In summary, the reference version is more nuanced and precise in its word choices, and thus, it is a more accurate and better-sounding version of the two.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea that the name ""Briarcliff Manor"" is derived from ""Brier Cliff"" in English. However, there are some differences in wording.

1. Word order: The word order in the machine-generated translation is slightly altered. Instead of ""Briarcliff Manor lässt sich ... ableiten"", the reference version uses ""Briarcliff Manor ... herleiten"". Both are grammatically correct, but the reference version sounds more natural in this context.

2. Word usage: The word ""Verbindung"" (connection, link, association) is used in the machine-generated version, while the reference version uses ""ableiten/herleiten von "" (to derive from, to trace back to, to originate from). The reference version is more accurate, as it emphasizes the name's origin, while the machine-generated one implies a more continuous relationship.

3. Consistency: The reference version consistently uses the past participle ""geleitet"" (led, derived, conducted) for the English verb ""to derive/lead to/stem from"" throughout the text, while the machine-generated one alternates between ""abstammt"" (is derived from, originates from, descends from) and ""ableiten/herleiten"" (to derive from, to stem from, to originate from).

In summary, the reference version is more consistent and accurately conveys the meaning of the original text. The machine-generated one contains minor errors and less-than-optimal word choices, but overall, it still provides the correct meaning.

The machine translation is very similar to the reference translation, with only a minor difference in word order. In the machine translation, the phrase ""den Vorort Faubourg de Vaucelles von Caen südlich des Orne River klären"" (the suburb Faubourg de Vaucelles of Caen south of the Ore River clarify) is placed after the verb ""klären"" (clarify/clean up), whereas in the reference translation, it is placed at the very end of the sentence.

Overall, the machine-generated and reference translations convey the same meaning and convey the information accurately. However, the minor word order difference may slightly affect the fluency and readability of the text.

However, there is a slight difference in the way the verb ""to scamper"" is translated. In the machine translation, it is translated as ""zu scampern"" which means to run or move quickly in a particular direction. In the reference translation, it is translated as ""umher zu huschen"" which means to move or dart about quickly.

While both translations convey the same meaning. ""Umher zu huschen"" adds a sense of quick, darting motion to the English verb ""to scamper"" as compared to ""zu scampern"" in the machine-generated output.

Moreover, the verb tense in the first part of the sentence differs slightly. The reference text uses the past tense ""scamped"", whereas the machine-generated version renders it in the present perfect tense ""waren"".

Overall, the machine-generated version is mostly accurate, but the reference version provides more nuanced word choices that enhance the meaning of the text.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original English source, and both have accurately translated the basic structure of the sentence. However, upon closer examination, there is a slight difference between the two translations by the machine and the reference.

In the machine-generated version, the word ""Pelze"" is used to translate ""pelts"", but in the reference, the word used is ""Pelze"". Although both words refer to animal hides or furs, ""Pelze"" is the more commonly used word in German, and it is the correct one to use in this context.

Therefore, the machine-generated version differs slightly from the reference in that it uses a less common word, ""Pelze"" to refer to ""pelts or furs"" instead of the more commonly used ""Pelze"" in the reference.

Overall, the difference between the two is minor, and the meaning of the sentence is still conveyed accurately in the machine-generated version. However, if you are looking for a more precise and accurate German-to-English or vice-versa, it is always a good idea to consult a professional or a reference version.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are German sentences that convey the same meaning as the original English sentence. The only slight variation I see is in the verb tense.

The verb tenses in the reference and machine-generated sentences are consistent with the source sentence, which is in the past tense. However, the verb ""kodifizierten"" in the reference and machine-generated sentences is in the past perfect tense, implying that the action of codifying the laws was completed in the past.

A literal English equivalent of the reference and machine-generated sentences in the past perfect tense is: ""lawgivers who had codified these laws had sought to modernize them while not abandoning their foundations in traditional jurisprudence.""

However, the verb tense in the reference and machine-generated sentences is still consistent with the meaning of the original sentence, and the slight discrepancy in verb tense is unlikely to cause confusion or misunderstanding.

Therefore, the machine-generated sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, and the minor discrepancy in verb tense is not significant enough to detract from the overall quality of the German-to-English translation.

However. there is a difference in the punctuation of the machine and reference translations. In the reference translation, the title of the book is in English and enclosed in quotation marks, whereas in the machine-generated version, the book's title is in German and not in quotes.

The reference version correctly maintains the English title of the book, while the machine-generated one does not. Additionally, the reference correctly includes quotation marks to indicate the English title, but the machine-generated one does not.

Therefore, the reference version is more accurate and should be preferred.

The machine and reference translations both accurately translate the individual symptoms from the original English to German. However, the reference and machine translations differ in their usage of punctuation. The reference version separates each symptom with a comma, while the machine version separates each symptom with a space.

In this particular context, the lack of commas in the machine-generated version does not significantly impact the meaning of the text. However, it is generally recommended to use commas to improve readability and ensure clarity in meaning. Therefore, the reference version is more preferable in this case.

Overall, the machine-generated version is mostly accurate, but the lack of proper punctuation slightly detracts from its readability and potential for ambiguity.

The difference between the machine and reference German translations lies in the words used for ""frugality"" and ""earthiness/earthy qualities"".

The machine.

- used ""Sparsamkeit"" for ""frugality""
- used ""Erdenheit"" for ""earthiness/earthy qualities""

The reference

- used ""Genügsamkeit"" for ""frugality""
- used ""Erdigkeit"" for ""earthiness/earthy qualities""

Both the words ""Sparsamkeit"" and ""Genügsamkeit"" can be used to translate ""frugality"" in a general sense, but ""Genügsamkeit"" implies a sense of self-sufficiency and resourcefulness, which is closer to the meaning of ""frugality"" in the English text.

Similarly, ""Erdenheit"" and ""Erdigkeit"" can both be used to describe ""earthiness/earthy qualities"", but ""Erdigkeit"" is less commonly used and sounds more poetic, whereas ""Erdenheit"" is a more straightforward and commonly used word.

Overall, the reference German text is a more accurate reflection of the English text, as it uses the more precise and appropriate words for the intended meaning. The machine's choice of words is not incorrect, but it is less nuanced and less reflective of the original English.

The source text mentions that the ""erection"" came too late for the ""collier, the Lady Darling."" However, the machine-generated translation incorrect.ly translates ""collier"". The reference, on the other hand, correctly renders ""collier"" as ""Bergarbeiter"" (miner or collier) in English.

The correct and idiomatic rendering of the entire sentence in the target language (German) is: ""Seine Errichtung kommt für den Bergarbeiter ein wenig zu spät, da dieLady Darling im Jahr 1880 südlich der Insel auf einem Riff strandete.""

Therefore, the difference in the two versions is the inaccurate rendering of ""collier"" in the machine-generated text. The reference correctly interprets ""collier"" as a reference to the profession of mining, and the correct word in the target language is ""Bergarbeiter"" (mining worker, or simply, a worker in the mining industry). The inaccuracy in the machine-generated version is likely due to the fact that the word ""collier"" is not a very common word in the source language, and the system was unable to recognize it as a reference to the profession.

Moreover, the word ""wrecked"" is not a very common word in the source text, and the system was unable to recognize it as a reference to a ship. Therefore, the word ""gekracht"" (wrecked, smashed, or crashed) is not used in the target text.

In summary, the primary difference in the target and reference texts is the inability of the system to correctly interpret the meaning of the word ""collier"" and the word ""wrecked"" in the context of the text.

2. Word usage: The word ""Worst"" in the source text is translated as ""schlechteste"" in the reference sentence, but the machine-generated sentence incorrectly renders it as ""schlechteste Manöver in der Geschichte!?"". The word ""Manöver"" is unnecessary in this context and is not present in the reference sentence.

The correct word order for this sentence places the verb at the end, as in the reference translation. Placing the verb at the end of the sentence is a common feature of German word order, and following this convention makes the sentence sound more natural and idiomatic in German.

2. Tense consistency: The verb ""zurückzugeben"" is in the infinitive form, while the reference translation uses the separable verb ""stellen"" in the imperative mood.

Using the imperative form in the reference text is more appropriate for the context, as it conveys a request or a call to action. The verb tense consistency in the reference text is more in line with the intended meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the reference text is more accurate and reads more naturally in German, as it adheres to the conventions of word order and verb tense consistency. The machine-generated text, while understandable. can be improved to sound more fluent and convey the intended meaning better.

 When comparing the machine and reference translations. Both versions follow the original text quite closely, but the reference version makes one small adjustment to the word order that improves the flow and readability of the sentence in the target language (German).

The original source text has the phrase ""wend[ing] through tentacled vegetation"" and the reference translation modifies this to ""Tentakelvegetation "" (tentacle-vegetation) to avoid repeating the word ""tentacled"" and improve the fluency of the sentence.

However, the machine-generated version repeats the word ""ententakelte"" (tentacled in a literal sense, but not a standard word in this meaning in any way) in the same way as the original, resulting in a less-fluent and slightly awkward-sounding sentence.

Therefore, the reference version is more accurate and fluent in this instance.

Source: Gelatinous worms writhe from layer to layer, winding through tentacled vegetation encrusted with orange moss, all suspended above a protean sea.

Reference: Gelatineartige Würmer ranken sich von Ebene zu Ebene und durchqueren die mit orangefarbigen Moos bewachsene Tentakel Veteran, die über einem proteischen Meer schweben.

In this case, the reference has used ""bewachsene Tentakel-Veteran "" (literally, ""tended-tentacle-veteran"") to avoid the awkwardness of the literal word-for-word ""tentacled-vegetation"" and to make the sentence flow more naturally.

The machine-generated text is:

Gelatineartige Würmer krümmen sich von Ebene zu Ebene durch die mit orangefarbigen Moos bewachsene Tintenfisch-Flora, die über einem proteischen Meer schweben.

Here, the machine-generated version has used the literal ""Titensenken-Flora "" (squid-flora) to refer to the tentacled vegetation, which is not a standard or commonly used word in the target language.

So, the reference is more accurate and fluent in this instance as well.

Overall, the reference is more accurate and fluent in the target language, as it avoids literal word-for-word repetition and makes the sentence flow more naturally.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are pretty close to the original source text, but there are some differences between the two translations.

The main difference between the machine and reference Translation is the usage of commas in the list of what the miners swept. The reference text separates the length and width of the channel with a single comma, while the machine-generated version separates them with a period.

The reference version is more accurate in this instance, as the original text separates the two measurements with only a single comma.

A secondary, more minor, difference between the two translations is the word ""swept"" in the original English. The reference version renders this as ""fegten,"" a German verb meaning ""to sweep"" or ""to clean,"" while the machine-generated one renders it as ""fegten,"" a more generic verb meaning ""to sweep"" or ""to clean.""

The verb used in the machine-generated translation is ""wurzelt,"" which is a less-common and somewhat archaic form of the verb ""wurzeln"" (to root or to have roots in a certain place or idea). The verb in the reference (and more widely used in everyday language in this context) is ""ermutigt,"" which means ""encourages"" or ""cheers on/for.""

So, the reference version is ""Ihr ermutigt sie und sympathisiert mit ihrer Not"" (You encourage/cheer them on and empathize with their distress/plight/situation/troubles/misery).

The machine-generated ""Ihr wurzelt für sie und sympathisiert mit ihrer Not"" (You have roots for them and empathize with their distress/plight/situation/troubles/misery) is understandable but less fluent and less likely to be used in everyday language.

In the machine-generated German sentence, ""Gebirgsbüffelei"" is used to translate ""mountebank buffoonery"" from the English sentence. However, ""Gebirgsbüffelei"" in German typically refers to the idea of ""alpine shenanigans"" or ""shenanigans in the mountains"" and does not convey the correct meaning of ""mountebank buffoonery"" in this context.

A better choice of words for the machine-generated sentence in this context might be ""Nijinska hat es vorzüglich eingefangen, den Geist der Gaunerclownerei."" This would convey the intended meaning of the original sentence, as ""Gaunerclownerei"" in German refers to the idea of a con-artist or mountebank and ""buffoonery"" conveys the playful and humorous aspect of the situation.

Overall, the reference Translation is more accurate and effectively conveys the meaning of the original sentence, as it accurately conveys the idea of a performer (in this case, ""Nijinska"") admirably embodying the playful and mischievous nature of a ""mountebank buffoonery"" in their performance.

 The machine translation ""Es ist gesättigt mit Materialismus, Sinnlichkeit und Virtualität"" differs from the reference translation ""Es ist reich an Materialismus, Sinnlichkeit und Virtualität"" in the word used for ""saturated"" in the machine Translation.

""Saturated"" implies an excess or overabundance, whereas ""reich an"" (rich in) implies a large amount but not necessarily an overabundance.

The reference Translation ""rich in "" is more appropriate in this context, as the original text implies that the subject is filled with or has a strong presence of these three qualities, not excessively but abundantly.

The word ""commercialism "" in the original is also translated differently in the machine and reference Translation.

""commercialism"" implies the pervasive influence of business and commerce, while ""Virtualität "" (virtuality) is not an accurate equivalent.

A more accurate Translation for ""saturated with commercialism"" in this context is ""gespickt mit Kommerzialismus "" (punctuated with commercialism) or ""durchdrungen von Kommerzialismus"" (steeped in commercialism).

Overall, the reference Translation is more accurate and appropriate in capturing the intended meaning of the original text.

 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is in the specific verb used to convey the meaning of Captain Robert Cunliffe's action in relation to Talbott.

The machine translation uses the verb ""entlasten,"" which means ""to relieve"" or ""to unburden."" While this verb can convey the idea of relieving someone.

However, in the context of the source sentence, a different verb is needed to convey the exact meaning intended. The reference Translation uses the verb ""entheben,"" which means ""to relieve of duty"" or ""to dismiss."" This verb conveys the meaning that Captain Robert Cunliffe has removed Talbott from his position or duties.

Therefore, the correct English-to-German Translation of ""Captain Robert Cunliffe relieved Talbott on 22 August"" in the context of the original sentence would be:

""Captain Robert Cunliffe enthob Talbott am 22. August seiner Pflichten."" (Captain Robert Cunliffe relieved Talbott of his duties on 22 August)

 The source text, ""Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and periphyton formations,"" is a biology-related statement describing the lifestyle of insect larvae.

The machine and reference translations both convey the same meaning, but there are subtle differences.

- The machine-generated text, ""Insektenlarven nutzen Wasser für die Zucht und ernähren sich von kleineren Kopepoden und Amphipoden, die in mikroskopischen Algen und peripheren Formationen leben"" is mostly accurate, with minor grammatical and word-choice differences compared to the reference.
- The reference-provided text, ""Insektenlarven nutzen Wasser für die Brut und ernähren sich von kleineren Kopepoden und Amphipoden, die in mikroskopischen Algen und peripheren Formationen leben"" is also accurate and conveys the same meaning.

The primary difference is the word ""brut/Brut"" (breed/breeding) and ""zucht/züchten"" (cultivation/cultivation, raise, rear, breed, multiply, propagate, proliferate, spread, increase, expand, spread, disseminate, sow, plant, generate, engender, progenerate, beget, father, bear, get, produce, proliferate, propagat, reproduce, spawn, swarm, teem, throng, trigger, vegetate).

In the context of the text, ""breed/breeding"" is the more appropriate word, as it refers to the reproduction of the insect larva, while ""cultivation/cultivation, raise, rear, breed, multiply, propagate, proliferate, spread, increase, expand, spread, disseminate, sow, plant, generate, engender, progenerate, beget, father, bear, get, produce, proliferate, reproduce, spawn, swarm, teem, throng, trigger, vegetate"" convey a more intentional meaning, as if the insect larva is actively cultivating the copepod and amphipod populations.

However, the overall meaning of the two target-language texts is the same, and the minor discrepancy in the word-choice is unlikely to cause confusion. Therefore, the machine-generated and reference-provided target-language texts convey the same meaning.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the general meaning of the source sentence, which appears to be about shooters firing from the edge of smaller pits. However, there is a difference in the placement of the word ""kleineren"" (smaller) in the two translations.

In the machine translation, ""kleineren"" modifies ""Gruben"" (pits) and is placed immediately after it, resulting in the sentence ""Die Schützen feuerten am Rande der kleineren Gruben."" (The shooters fired at the edge of the smaller pits.)

In the reference translation, ""kleineren"" is placed before ""Gruben"" and is separated from it by the word ""jemand"" (someone), resulting in the sentence ""Die Schützen feuerten vom Rand der kleineren Gruben."" (The shooters fired from the edge of the smaller pits.)

The difference in word order and placement of ""kleineren"" does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. Both translations convey the same overall meaning, with ""kleineren"" serving to modify ""Gruben"" and indicating that the pits are smaller in size. However, the reference translation follows idiomatic German word order more closely, with ""kleineren"" placed closer to the beginning of the sentence and separated from ""Gruben"" by the intervening word.

In summary, while both translations convey the same meaning. The reference follows idiomatic word order more closely.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source sentence, namely that a tropical cyclone named Simon dissipated early on October 15 over the open waters of the North Pacific.

However, there is a difference in the word order between the two translations. The machine-generated translation uses a different word order compared to the reference, placing ""über das offene Wasser des Nordostpazifiks"" (over the open waters of the North Pacific) at the end of the sentence, whereas the reference places it earlier in the sentence.

The reference version is more faithful to the original sentence, as it maintains the chronological sequence of the original sentence, with the description of the location (""über dem offenen Wasser des Nordostpazifiks"" / ""over the open waters of the North Pacific Ocean"") preceding the description of the cyclone's dissipation.

Therefore, the reference version is a more accurate and faithful representation of the original sentence compared to the machine-generated one.

The reference Translation provided is ""Anhörung vor dem Unterausschuss des Ausschusses für H.R.-Mittelzuweisungen""

The difference between the machine and reference Translation is in the word ""Aneignungen"" and ""Mittelzuweisungen"" which both mean something like ""appropriations"" in English.

A more accurate Translation of the source text in this context is ""Appropriations"" and not ""Aneignungen"" as provided by the machine.

So the correct and more appropriate Translation of the source would be ""Anhörung vor dem Unterausschuss des Ausschusses für Appropriations to H.R.""

In summary, the main difference between the reference and the machine Translation is the word ""Aneignungen"" and ""Mittelzuweisungen"" which should be ""Appropriations"" in this context.

However, there is a slight difference in how the two translations express the development of the depression into a tropical storm.

The machine translation uses the verb ""intensivierte sich"" which means ""intensified/aggravated itself"" to describe the development of the depression. In contrast, the reference translation uses the verb ""aufbaute sich"" which means ""developed/grew"" to express the same concept.

While both translations convey the same meaning. ""Aufbauen"" (to build up, develop) is more appropriate here as it better reflects the process of the depression transforming into a tropical storm. Therefore, the reference Translation is more accurate in expressing the meaning of the original text.

 The source text describes a building with three naves, a coffered ceiling, and cupolas above the presbytery and intersection. Both the machine and reference translations convey the same information in German.

However. there is no significant difference between the two translations. In this case, the machine has translated the English terms ""naves"" and ""intersection ""literally into their German equivalents, ""Schiffe "" and ""Kreuzung"", respectively.

The reference and machine-generated texts use the same words for the translations, and the grammatical structure of the sentences is also the same. Therefore, it is challenging to evaluate the quality of the machine-generated text based solely on this comparison.

However, it is worth noting that the reference and the machine-generated text use the same words and phrasing, suggesting that the machine-generated version is at least adequate. A more rigorous evaluation would involve comparing multiple source texts and translations, assessing the fluency and naturalness of the generated text, and evaluating how closely the generated text matches the intended meaning of the original.

Here are the differences:

1. Word choice: The verb ""stimmte"" in the machine translation is not appropriate in this context. ""Stimmte"" is a transitive verb that requires an object, but in the source text, ""Sting voiced the narrator of..."" does not have a direct object. A more accurate verb to use in the English-G german translation is ""ware"" (was in English), which is used in the reference to mean ""was the narrator of...""

2. Word form: ""Geschmackes"" is not a valid word in the German language. The correct word is ""geschmeckt"".

3. Word spacing: The word ""Wine"" in the source is translated as ""Wine"" in the machine-generated text, but it should be ""Wein"" in the target language.

A correct and more accurate rendering of the English sentence in the target language is: ""2018 war Sting die Stimme des Erzählers von Wo das Wasser wie Wein schmeckt.""

So, the reference and the corrected sentence convey the same meaning, but the reference is more accurate and more idiomatic in the target language.

In the source text. Brunei enumerated people by ethnicity in all censuses since 1947.

The reference translation conveys this meaning well by stating ""Seit 1945 zählte Brunei Menschen in allen Volkszählungen nach ethnischer Zugehörigkeit auf."" Here, the word ""nach ethnischer Zugehörigkeit"" specifically refers to enumeration based on ethnic background, which is the intended meaning.

However, the machine translation uses the phrase ""nach Ethnizität"" to refer to the same concept. Although this is also an accurate translation, it is less commonly used in everyday language and sounds slightly more awkward in this context.

Overall, the machine-generated text conveys the intended meaning, but the reference text uses more commonly used phrasing, which makes it easier to understand.

 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation lies in the way the verb ""oppose"" is translated in the context of the sentence. The machine.translation uses the verb ""entgegenstellen"" which means ""to oppose"" or ""to stand opposite to."" However, the reference Translation uses the verb ""ablehnen"" which means ""to reject"" or ""to oppose.""

In the context of the sentence, the verb ""ablehnen"" is a more appropriate choice as the mutualists opposed the ideas of both
communism and etatism, rather than just standing in opposition to them. Therefore, the reference Translation is more accurate than the machine. Translation.

The verb ""oppose"" in the source sentence can be interpreted as meaning either ""to oppose"" or ""to reject/disagree with/disagree about."" The choice of verb in the reference Translation is more reflective of the intended meaning in the context of the sentence, as the focus is on the rejection of the ideas of both
communism and etatism, not just the mere presence of an opposing stance.

Overall, the reference Translation is more precise and accurate in reflecting the meaning of the original sentence, and the choice of the verb ""ablehnen"" is crucial in conveying the intended meaning.

The main difference is in the word order and word choice. In the reference translation, a comma and the word ""wobei"" (meaning ""while/where/when.., part of comparative or relative clause in german grammar) is used to clarify that Lowrey's Brigade was on the far right. In the machine-generated version, the word ""mit"" (meaning ""with/by means of/together with"") is used, which slightly changes the meaning and implies that the Brigade was positioned next to the other brigades, not on the extreme right.

A more accurate and nuanced machine-generated version of the sentence, which conveys the meaning of the reference version, is: ""Cleburne führte seine Brigaden in Staffelon-Formation, während Lowrey's Brigade ganz rechts war."" (Cleburne staggered his brigades in echelon formation, with Lowrey's Brigade on the far right)

This is not a major issue, as both phrases convey the same meaning, but it is still a slight inaccuracy compared to the reference.

Overall, the machine's ability to translate the meaning of the original text is quite good, but it is important to note that small differences in wording and phrasing can sometimes result in slightly different meanings.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source sentence, which is that artillery spotters were a particularly valued target for snipers. However, there is a difference in the wording used for the term ""artillery spotters"" in the two translations.

The source sentence uses a hyphen in the term ""artillery spotters"" to link the two words together. The machine and reference translations both use the hyphen in the corresponding German sentence, with the word ""Artillerie-Spotter.""

However, the reference translation adds an ""-e"" to the end of ""Artillerie"" to make it ""Artillerie-Spotter."" This is because in German, nouns must agree in gender, number, and case. In this case, the gender of ""Spotter"" is feminine, and the gender of ""Artillerie"" is masculine. In order to make the two words agree in gender, the ""-e"" is added to ""Artillerie"" to make it feminine, resulting in ""Artillerie-Spotter.""

The machine translation, on the other hand, correctly uses the masculine form of ""Artillerie-Spotter"" in the sentence. This is a slight discrepancy from the reference translation, but it does not significantly impact the meaning or fluency of the sentence.

Overall, the machine and reference translations both accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence, with the reference slightly preferable for its use of the feminine ""Artillerie-Spotter"" to maintain consistency in gender.

 In this case. both the machine and reference translations from English to German for the sentence ""This led to feuding with Christian Cage and Rhino"" are identical: ""Dies führte zu Fehden mit Christian Cage und Rhino.""

The German verb ""führen"" here means ""to lead or result in,"" and ""Fehde"" here refers to a feud or conflict. The proper nouns ""Christian Cage"" and ""Rhino"" remain the same in the target language, as these are proper names and not linguistic elements that need to be translated.

Juli mit einem Henry-Farman-Doppeldecker der Sopwith School of Flying in Brooklands ."" However, there is one small difference. In the reference translation, there is a hyphen in ""Henry-Farman-Doppeldecker"" which is not present in the machine's version.

In the reference, the hyphen is used to break up the compound adjective ""Henry-Farman-Doppeldecker"" (Henry-Farman biplane) and improve readability. The lack of a hyphen in the machine's version slightly decreases the readability of the text, but it does not significantly impact the overall meaning.

When evaluating the quality of a machine's English-to-German text, it is essential to consider the grammatical correctness, fluency, and readability of the text. In this specific case, the lack of a hyphen in the machine's version slightly decreases the text's fluency and readability, but it is still comprehensible and conveys the intended meaning.

Therefore, the difference between the reference and the machine's version is minor, and the overall quality of the text is good. However, it is crucial to note that the lack of fluency and readability due to missing punctuation is a factor to consider for future evaluations.

In the machine's version, it says ""lässt ihn in den Ozean fallen und beabsichtigt, ihn zu ertrinken,"" which literally means ""lets him fall into the ocean and intends to drown him.""

In contrast, the reference version uses the verb ""wirft"" (throws) to describe the action, as in ""wirft ihn in den Ozean mit der Absicht, ihn ertrinken zu lassen.""

The reference's use of ""wirft"" paints a more active and deliberate picture of the action taken by Buddy, as opposed to the passive ""lässt...fallen"" in the machine's version.

Overall, the reference's wording is more precise and vivid, and conveys the severity of the situation more accurately. Therefore, the reference is a better and more accurate reflection of the original English text.

However, there is a slight difference in the punctuation between the two translations. The reference translation includes quotation marks around the song title ""Royals"" with a non-breaking space before and after the word, while the machine translation has no spaces between the word and the quotation marks.

In terms of readability and formatting, the reference version is preferable, as the consistent usage of quotation marks and non-breaking spaces helps to distinguish the song title from the rest of the text.

In the machine translation, the verb ""erzeugt"" (creates) is separated from its object ""den Perlensack"" (the pearl sac) by the adverbial phrase ""um die Irritation zu versiegeln"" (to seal off the irritation). In contrast, the reference translation keeps the verb-object structure intact, placing ""den Perlensack"" immediately after ""erzeugt"" and using a colon to introduce the purpose clause.

The main difference between the two translations is the use of the verb ""bildeten"" (formed) in the machine translation, as opposed to ""bildeten sich"" (literally: formed themselves) in the reference translation. The passive voice in the reference translation emphasizes the natural process of formation, making the description sound more natural and accurate.

Another slight discrepancy is the word ""exposed"" in the source text, which is translated as ""exponiert"" in the machine translation. However, the reference translation uses ""freiliegend"" to describe the clay, Kreide (chalk), and the other geological features. While ""exponiert"" and ""freiliegend"" both convey the idea of exposure, ""freiliegend"" is more commonly used in the given context, and thus sounds more natural and fitting.

Lastly, the reference translation separates the three different geological materials (Grünsand/greensand and Sandstein/sandstone) with commas, while the machine translation separates them with ""oder"" (or). Although the meaning remains the same, separating the items with a simple comma is more consistent with the conventions of list-making in the target language.

In summary, the reference and machine translations convey the same meaning, but the reference version is more accurate and adheres more closely to the conventions of the target language.

The reference-quality sentence maintains the word order of the original, with the relative clause coming before the noun phrase that it describes.

A second, more substantive, difference is in the use of the definite article ""den"" in the reference-translation, which is absent in the machine-generated sentence. The reference-translation renders the English ""the"" in ""the traditional cavalry attack in two ranks of horsemen with sables or lances"" as ""den"" in ""den traditionelle Kavallerieangriff in zwei Reihen durch Reiter, die mit Säbeln oder Lanzen bewaffnet waren.""

In the reference and machine-generated German sentences, the word ""Neutralität"" is used to refer to the same concept of neutrality, and the word ""tendenziell"" is used to convey the idea of a tendency towards a lack of action.

However, the word ""indecision"" in the reference and machine-generated sentences is a slightly different concept from the word ""indecision"" in the English sentence. ""Indecision"" implies a lack of ability to choose, whereas ""indecision"" can imply a lack of confidence in the choice, or a lack of willingness to choose.

Overall, the reference and machine-generated sentences convey the meaning of the original sentence, but the nuance of the nuance in the nuance is slightly different.

Here are the specific differences:

1. Word Choice: In the source text and reference translation, ""stellvertretenden Vereinigten Staaten"" refers to ""Deputy US Marshals."" However, in the machine translation, ""stellvertretenden USA"" mistranslates this term as ""the substitute US/United States.""

2. Word Order: The word order slightly differs in the machine-generated text, making it sound less fluent and less readable. For instance, the reference and source texts use the past tense ""beschäftigte"" (employed/hired in the past tense), but the machine-generated version incorrectly uses the present tense ""beschäftigt"" (employed/hires in the present tense).

3. Punctuation: The punctuation differs slightly in the machine-generated version, with the reference and source texts including a space between the verb and the comma separating the clauses, but the machine-generated one lacks this space.

A correct and idiomatic rendering of the English sentence in German is:

Therefore, the reference and the source texts agree in including the article, and the machine-generated text differs slightly in this respect.

However, the overall meaning and content of the sentence remain the same, and the slight omission of the article in the machine-generated text does not significantly detract from the intended meaning.

A more accurate term might be ""Kopje-Vorkommen"" or ""Kopje-Aufschlüsse,"" as used in the reference.

2. The verb form: ""ein Weinen knirscht"" (a weeping crunches/grinds). ""Knirschen"" is not an appropriate verb to use in this context, as it usually refers to making a harsh, grating noise. A more fitting verb might be ""rollt"" or ""läuft"" (rolls or trickles), as used in the reference.

3. The word form: ""Träne"" (tear/drop of liquid/weeping) is more appropriate for a weeping or emotional context, while the original and reference text use ""Tröpfchen"" (a small drop of liquid/a trickle of water/a tear-like form).

 The machine translation ""Garibaldi, frustriert über Untätigkeit durch den König, und Borsten über wahrgenommene Büschel, organisierte ein neues Venture"" slightly differs in meaning from the reference translation ""Garibaldi, der über die Untätigkeit des Königs frustriert war und sich über wahrgenommene Brüskierungen sträubte, gründete ein neues Unternehmen.""

The main difference lies in the translation of the phrase ""bristling over perceived snubs"" in the original text. The word ""bristling"" conveys a sense of anger or indignation, and the word ""perceived snubs"" refers to instances of slight or disrespect.

In the machine translation, the word ""Borsten"" is used to translate ""bristling over perceived snubs"" which does not convey the same meaning. ""Borsten"" means to stick out or to be rough, and it is not an appropriate word to convey the meaning of ""perceived snubs"" in this context.

The reference-translation correctly conveys the meaning of the original text by using the word ""sträubte sich über wahrgenommene Brüskierungen"" to convey the sense of anger and slight experienced by Garibaldi.

Therefore, the machine-translation differs from the reference-translation in the way it conveys the meaning of the original text, specifically in the way it interprets the meaning of ""bristling over perceived snubs"". The reference-translation correctly conveys the meaning of the phrase, but the machine-translation does not.

 The machine translation ""Der Van zieht in eine Gasse in Newark, New Jersey."" is close to the original English text, but it differs slightly from the reference translation.

The key difference between the machine and reference translations is the verb used to describe the van's movement. The machine.. Translation uses ""zieht...in"" (literally ""is pulling in/to""), while the reference version uses ""fährt heran und hält an"" (literally ""driving in and stopping"").

""Fährt heran und hält an"" conveys a more complete and accurate meaning of the original text, as it implies that the van is not just approaching the alley but also stopping in it. The verb ""zieht"" in the machine version lacks the ""stopping"" aspect, making it less precise.

Moreover, the reference version also includes the verb ""hält an,"" which emphasizes the stopping action, and is more consistent with the meaning of the original text. Therefore, the reference version is more accurate and desirable in this case.

The main difference is in the word order. In the machine translation, the word ""again"" ((""dann""). is placed after the verb ""schlägt"" (strikes), whereas in the reference translation, it appears after the adverb ""tdlich"" (fatal).

The machine-generated translation ""Er wurde ein Einsätziger, der die Göttlichkeit Jesu ablehnte"" literally translates to ""He became a protagonist, who rejected the divinity of Jesus.""

The reference (human) translation, ""Er wurde ein Unitarier, der die Göttlichkeit Jesu ablehnte"" correctly renders the original text as ""He became a Unitarian, who rejected the divinity of Jesus.""

The difference is that the word ""Einsatziger"" in the machine-generated text does not mean ""Unitarian"" but is an adjective meaning ""active, engaged, committed, or operational."" The reference and machine-generated versions both use the verb ""werde"" (become) and the participle ""ablehnend"" (rejecting) to describe the subject, but the reference version correctly includes the word ""Unitarier"" (Unitarian) to describe the subject, while the machine-generated version does not.

Therefore, the reference and machine-generated versions differ in the nuanced meaning of the subject, with the reference correctly denoting the religious affiliation of the subject as a ""Unitarian"" and the machine-generated version describing the subject as an ""engaged/committed/active protagonist"" who rejects the idea of the deity of Christ.

In the source text. ""Nick Fury's Howling Commandos"" is a team that includes Hercules. However, in the machine-generated translation, the possessive ""'s"" in ""Nick Fury's"" is missing, and the word ""einer"" (one) is used in the wrong gender, which slightly alters the meaning of the sentence.

The reference-quality human-generated version correctly renders the meaning of the original text, with the possessive ""'s"" intact and the gender of ""einer"" changed to ""einer"" to agree with ""Hercules"" (masc.).

Therefore, the reference-quality version is: ""Im Ultime Marvel-Universum erscheint Herkules als einer von Nick Furys Hurlenden Kommandos.""

To summarize, the main differences between the machine and reference-level human-generated versions are the lack of possessive in the machine-generated one and the incorrect use of gender for the numeral ""einer"" in the machine-generated one.

Here are the differences:

1. Word Choice: In the machine-generated Translation, the verb ""ausgestattet"" (outfitted/equipped) is used, while the reference Translation uses ""rüsteten aus"" (outfitted/equipped). While both words convey a similar meaning, ""rüsten aus"" is more appropriate in this context, as it implies preparation and outfitting for a specific purpose (i.e., the Klondike Gold Rush in 1898).
2. Word Form: The machine-generated Translation uses the present tense ""ausgestattet"" (are outfitting/are equipping/are equipped), while the reference Translation uses the past tense ""rüsteten aus"" (outfitted/equipped). The correct tense to use in this context is the past tense, as the action of preparing and equipping the prospectors took place in the past.
3. Sentence Structure: The reference Translation places the phrase ""die 1898 für den Klondike-Goldrausch bestimmt waren"" (who were designated for the Klondike-Gold Rush in 1898) at the end of the sentence, emphasizing the purpose of the outfitting. The machine-generated Translation lacks this emphasis, as the corresponding phrase ""für den Klondike-Goldrausch im Jahr 1898"" (for the Klondike-Gold-Rush in the year 1898) is placed earlier in the sentence.

In conclusion, the reference Translation is more accurate and emphasizes the correct tense and word emphasis, while the machine-generated Translation lacks precision and nuance.
