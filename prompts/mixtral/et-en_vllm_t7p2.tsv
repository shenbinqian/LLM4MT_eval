0	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in a few ways. First, the machine translation uses the phrase ""måy not be wanted...or perhaps not wanted"" which is less clear and emphatic than the reference translation's ""may not be wanted...or more accurately, should not be wanted."" The reference translation makes it clear that the author is making a strong recommendation for what a ""rational wish-maker"" should do, whereas the machine Translation is less assertive in its wording.

Secondly, the reference translation uses the term ""rational actor"" which is a common term used in economics and game theory, while the machine Translation uses the less precise phrase ""a rational player.""

Overall, the reference Translation is clearer, more precise, and more emphatic than the machine Translation. The reference Translation makes it clear that the author is making a normative claim about what a ""rational actor/wish-maker "" should want, while the machine Translation is less clear in this regard. Additionally, the reference Translation uses more precise and technical language, making it a better fit for the context of the original Estonian text.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the message of the original Estonian text, which is about the importance of determining the difference between someone's actions and the seriousness of a murder. However, the machine-generated translation contains a minor error in the wording.

The word ""vahel"" was incorrectly translated as ""that show us"" instead of ""which show us"" in the machine-generated version. A better translation of the Estonian sentence for the considered difference between the source and reference versions would be: ""It is important to decide how great a difference there is between what he has done. and the actions that demonstrate the severity of the murder.""

Overall. the reference and machine-generated versions share the same meaning, but the reference is more precise and accurate in its word choice.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, but there are some differences in how they translate one of the place names. In the source text. ""Esimesel päeval kohtus Ukraina peaministri Viktor Janukovõtšiga ja presidendi Viktor Juštšenkoga"" the name of the location, ""Ukraina/Ukraine"" is written as part of the name of the Prime Minister, Viktor Yanukovych.

In the machine-generated translation, the word ""Ukraina/Ukraine"" is left in its original form, as ""Ukraina peaministri"". However, in the reference translation, the word is moved and written as ""Ukrainian"" to modify ""Prime Minister"" and make the sentence clearer for English-speaking readers.

Overall, the reference and machine-generated versions both provide the same information, but the reference version is more readable and clear for English-speaking audiences.

3	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, which is that there is no official diplomatic representation of Estonia in a certain country. However, there is a slight but important difference in the wording.

The source sentence specially mentions ""diplomaatiline esindust"" (diplomatic representation/mission in Estonian language), but the machine and reference translations interpret it differently.

The machine rendering ""There is no Estonian diplomatic representation or honorary consul in the country"" is technically correct, but it is less precise in conveying the meaning of the original sentence, as it does not specifically mention the absence of a ""diplomatic mission/esindus"" (establishment/permanent presence of a state in a foreign territory, such as an embassy or consulate-general).

The reference human-generated version ""There is no Estonian diplomatic mission or honorary consul in the country "" is more precise and closer to the meaning of the original, as it specifically includes the concept of a ""mission/esindus"" (permanent diplomatic presence of a state in a foreign territory, such as an embassy or consulate-general).

Therefore, the reference human-generated version is more faithful to the meaning of the original, and thus a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the intended meaning.

4	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not convey the correct meaning of the original Estonian sentence. The source sentence states that some metals become ""roostetates"" (rusty/rust-covered) when they rust, rather than simply becoming ""more difficult
"" or ""heavier"" as the machine and reference translations suggest, respectively.

A more accurate English rendering of the original sentence might be: ""Some Islamic chemists already knew that some metals would become rust-covered in the process of rusting.""

The reference and machine translations both contain errors, as the reference incorrectly suggests that the metals become ""heavier"" and the machine incorrectly suggests that the metals simply become ""more difficult"" in the rusting process.

It is important to note that the reference and machine translations differ in meaning from the original sentence, and that the reference and machine both contain errors.

Second. the machine incorrectly translated ""piirasid Tallinnat kümne tuhande mehega"" as ""reistricted Tallinn to ten thousand men"" when a more accurate translation would be ""besieged Tallinn with ten thousand men.""

 The machine translation ""The Popperi demarkatsioonikriteerium between science and pseudo-science stipulated that theory must be homogenised"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""Popper's demarcation criterion between science and pseudo-science stipulated that theory must be falsified.""

Here are the specific differences:

1. The phrase ""Popperi demarkatsioonikriteerium"" in the source text is mistranslated as ""The Popperi demarkatsioonikriteerium"" in the machine translation. The correct translation should be ""Popper's demarcation criterion"" as in the reference translation.
2. The verb ""peab"" in the source text is incorrectly translated as ""must be homogenised"" in the machine translation. A more accurate translation would be ""must be testable or refutable"" or ""must be subject to attempted falsification"" in line with Karl Popper's philosophy of science.

The reference translation is more accurate and reflects the meaning of the original text more closely. The concept of falsifiability or testability is a key principle in Karl Popper's philosophy of science, and it is essential to convey this meaning rather than translating the term literally as ""homogenised ""in the context of the demarcation criterion.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same basic meaning, which is that the water is generally clean but has accumulated sludge in some areas. However, there are some differences in how they express this meaning.

One difference is in the wording of the phrase ""relatively clean."" In the source text. In the reference translation, the word ""relatively"" is used to convey the same meaning as ""v Relativeisuguse"" in the original text. However, the machine-generated version uses the phrase ""even though some places are gathering sludge"" to convey the same meaning. While both translations convey the same meaning, the reference version is closer to the original wording.

Another slight variation between the two translations is in the wording of the second clause. The reference version renders ""muda"" as ""sludge,"" while the machine-generated one renders it as ""sludge gathering."" This is a minor difference in wording, but it may affect the overall fluency and readability of the text.

Overall, the reference and machine-generated versions both convey the same meaning, but the reference version is closer to the original and is more naturally worded. The slight variations in wording between the reference and the machine-generated text suggest that the reference is a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the original.

8	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is subtle but important. The source text uses the phrase ""suunamiseks Euroopa Ülemkogu kohtumisele,"" which literally translates to ""forwarding to the meeting of the European Council."" The reference translation takes this a step further and specifies that the draft budget will be directed to the ""European Council meeting,"" rather than just the ""European Council.""

The machine translation, on the other hand, simply translates the phrase as ""the European Council"" without specifying that it is referring to a meeting. This could potentially lead to confusion, as readers may assume that the draft budget is simply being directed to the European Council as an institution, rather than to a specific meeting of that institution.

Overall. the reference translation is more precise and clear in its meaning, while the machine translation is somewhat ambiguous.

 The machine translation ""all the things come from one spinary"" is different from the reference translation ""all things come from one primordial origin.""

The term ""spinary"" in the machine translation is not a standard or recognized term in English philosophy or linguistics, and it is unclear what the term is attempting to convey. In contrast, the reference translation uses the term ""primordial origin,"" which is a clear and well-understood concept in philosophy, referring to the original source or cause of all things.

Furthermore, the verb form ""come from"" used in the machine translation is not idiomatic in English and sounds awkward. A more appropriate verb would be ""originate"" or ""emanate from,"" as used in the reference translation.

Overall, the reference translation is more precise, clear, and idiomatic in its use of language, making it a better reflection of the original source material.

10	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation ""From the complex theories that the philosophy must develop, simple and obvious facts must be returned"" is quite close in meaning to the reference translation ""From the complex theories that philosophy must develop, we must return to simple and obvious facts.""

However, there is a slight difference in the wording of the two translations. In the reference translation, the pronoun ""we"" is used, indicating that the responsibility to return to simple and obvious facts is placed on the reader or the philosophical community as a whole. In contrast, the machine-generated version uses the passive voice (""must be returned""), making it unclear who is responsible for returning to these facts.

In addition, the machine-generated version slightly modifies the word order, placing ""simple and obvious facts"" after ""must be returned"" instead of before it. This results in a less clear and slightly awkward sentence structure.

Overall, the machine-generated version conveys the same meaning as the reference version, but with some minor differences in wording and sentence structure that make it less clear and natural-sounding.

 The machine translation ""And if so, the loan will try to identify them straight away"" is somewhat close in meaning to the reference translation ""And if so, Laine will try to identify them at once"", but there are some differences that make the machine Translation less accurate.

Firstly, the subject of the sentence in the machine Translation is ""the loan"", while in the reference Translation, the subject is ""Laine"". A careful reading of the source text confirms that the reference Translation is more accurate, as the original sentence is using the possessive form ""Laine's loan"" (in Estonian ""Laine need"").

 The source text in Estonian mentions that Kuigi Darwin vaevles perioodiliste haigushoogude käes viimased 22 aastat oma elust, which translates for ""Darwin suffered from periodic diseases for the last 22 years of his life.""

The machine-generated English text correctly conveys the meaning of the Estonian, but it is worded slightly awkwardly. The reference English text is more clear and fluent, and it is easier to understand.

The main difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the wording of the sentence.

The machine-generated text is slightly more awkward and indirect, saying ""Although Darwin had the last 22 years of life in the hands of periodic disease care, this did not prevent him from continuing his work.""

 The machine translation ""He asked the Montréal journalist Michael Woloschuk to get clarity in his life"" differs from the reference translation ""He hired a Montréal journalist Michael Woloschuk to get clarity about his father's life.""

In the source text, the Estonian phrase ""saamaks selgus isa elukäigus"" is translated as ""to get clarity in his life"" in the machine-generated version. However, the reference version provides more specificity, indicating that the subject hired the journalist to gain clarity about his ""father's life"" rather than just his own.

The difference in the two versions arises from the interpretation of the word ""isakast"" in the original text, which means ""one's own or personal"" in a broader sense. However, in this specific context, the word ""isa"" (meaning ""father's"" or ""paternal"") is used as a modifier for the word ""elukäigus"" (meaning ""life-course"" or ""life story"").

The reference version is more accurate in conveying the intended meaning of the original text, as it clarifies the subject of the investigation. Therefore, the machine-generated version falls short of conveying the complete meaning of the original.

 The machine translation ""Normal science in general is keeping the philosophy away, and rightly so"" differs from the reference translation ""Normal science in general is keeping a distance from philosophy, and probably rightly so"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the verb tense used in the machine translation is inconsistent. The subject ""science"".is in the present tense in the first part of the sentence, but the verb ""is keeping"" is in the progressive tense, which is not necessary by the context of the sentence. The reference translation correctly uses the simple present tense ""keeps a distance from"" to describe the relationship between science and philosophy.

Second, the word ""away"" used in the machine translation is not an accurate reflection of the original text. The word ""üldiselt"" in the original text means ""in general"" or ""on the whole,"" and does not imply a sense of moving away or distancing oneself, as suggested by the word ""away"" in the machine translation.

Finally, the word ""rightly"" in the machine translation is replaced with ""probably rightly"" in the reference translation. The word ""probably"" is added to convey a sense of caution or uncertainty, which is not present in the original text.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text, as it maintains the consistent verb tense, accurately reflects the meaning of ""üldiselt"". and conveys the appropriate level of caution.

Firstly, the subject of the sentence in the machine-generated version is not clear without referring to the original Estonian sentence. The reference English version makes it clear that Ülu (the wolse) is asking for something, whereas the machine-generated sentence is not clear about who is being asked.

Second, the grammatical structure of the two English sentences differs significantly. The reference English sentence is written in the present tense, while the machine-generated sentence is in the future tense.

Finally, the meaning of the two English sentences differs slightly. The reference English sentence implies that Ülu is asking for permission to receive customers at Uuevariku, while the machine-generated sentence implies that someone will ask for permission to receive customers in the future.

Overall, the reference English sentence is more accurate and clear in conveying the meaning of the original Estonian sentence. The machine-generated sentence contains errors in grammatical tense and meaning, and it lacks clarity in the sentence structure.

 Both the machine and reference translations follow the same general structure and meaning, conveying that Ludwig Wittgenstein's followers share a belief about the nature of learning. However, the primary difference between the two translations is the absence of proper diacritical marks in the machine-generated version. In the original Estonian text, the word ""uskuma"" (tend to believe) needs to be capitalized as ""Uskuma"" to maintain proper grammatical form.

Apart from the minor capitalization issue, the primary structure and meaning of the two versions are consistent. The reference and machine-generated versions slightly differ in their word choices, but the overall meaning remains the same.

Capitalization aside, the primary difference in this case is the fluency and naturalness of language use. The reference version flows more naturally and accurately reflects the nuances of the original statement. The machine-generated version is understandable but lacks the same level of fluency and precision.

In summary, the primary discrepancy in the provided example is the proper use of capitalization, with minor differences in the word choices used in the respective target languages.

A more accurate translation of the Estonian sentence would be ""Government forces repelled the rebels, and about 30 air strikes were carried out on the rebel positions outside the city."" The verb ""tõrjuda"" here means to repulse, and the subject performing the action is ""government forces."" The rebels are the ones being repulsed, and the rebel positions are the objects or targets of the airstrikes. The verb ""give"" in the context of the reference translation is used as a more general term for the airstrikes, but it is not an accurate reflection of the verb in the original sentence. Additionally, the word ""dinner"" in the machine's response is not present in the original sentence, and it is a poor translation of ""õhulööki"" which is a term for an airstrike or bombardment.

However, the machine incorrectly interpreted ""Marele reisi"" as ""Marek's trip"" and assumed the subject of the sentence to be ""Margna wants to marry her wife and brings Marek's trip to Morocco to life.""

The verb ""abielluda"" in the source language means ""give as a gift"" or ""a present for someone"" and not ""to marry with someone "" as interpreted by the machine.

The reference and the machine-generated text also differ in the gender of the person being referred to. The reference correctly identifies ""Marek"" as a male, but the machine incorrectly assumes the gender of the name to be female.

In summary, the primary differences between the reference and the machine-generated text are the interpretation of the proper noun ""Marele reisi"" and the verb ""abielluda"" and the gender of the person being referred to.

However, the reference translation uses ""this impulse"". In contrast, the machine.

The machine's use of ""feeling"" rather than ""imulse"" in the English version is not unreasonable, but the reference version seems to be a more accurate reflection of the meaning of the original word ""sede"" in the Estonian sentence, which means a sudden or fleeting feeling, impulse, or desire.

Overall, the difference between the two English versions is relatively minor, and the meaning of the original sentence is still conveyed in the machine-generated version.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in a few ways. Firstly, the machine translation uses negation. ""It is not..."" appears three times, whereas the reference translation does not use any negative language. This changes the tone and meaning of the sentence.

Secondly, the machine translation repeats ""it is not"" multiple times, whereas the reference translation only includes ""it is not"" once. This redundancy in the machine translation can make it sound repetitive and unclear.

Lastly, the reference translation includes the phrase ""capacity for considered action nor the ability to act based on reasons given to oneself,"" which is not present in the machine translation. This is a significant difference, as this phrase is crucial to understanding the meaning of the original text.

Overall, the machine translation is less clear and precise in meaning compared to the reference translation.

 The primary difference between the machine and reference translations lies in the word choice for the Estonian word ""kaalutlusel,"" which both translate to ""consideration"" in English. However, the subtle distinction between the words ""force"" and ""weight"" in the context of the reference human translation conveys a nuance that the machine failed to grasp.

In the reference text, the use of ""weight"" implies that the consideration in question bears more importance or significance in Jim's case, as opposed to simply referring to it as a ""special force"" in the machine-generated text. The word ""weight"" here suggests that the matter at hand is more crucial, impactful, or influential for Jim, as compared to other cases.

The reference text thus communicates a more profound and nuanced meaning, highlighting the subject's emotional or psychological prominence, while the machine-generated version merely refers to the matter as a simple, abstract entity. Therefore, the reference text is more evocative and emotionally resonant, while the machine-generated one is more literal and less nuanced.

When comparing the machine and reference Translations, the main difference is the use of the word ""amplifier"" in the reference Translation, while the machine Translation uses ""the client.""

In the context of the original Estonian text, ""Võimendaja"" refers to a background factor or circumstance that enhances or amplifies the impact of a particular reason or factor. Therefore, the reference Translation correctly conveys the meaning of the original text by using the word ""amplifier"" to refer to this enhancing or strengthening effect.

On the other hand, the machine Translation uses the word ""the client"" to refer to the ""Võimendaja"" in the original text. This is a mistranslation, as the concept of a ""background factor or circumstance"" is not conveyed by the word ""the client"" in English.

Overall, the reference Translation is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text, as it correctly captures the concept of a factor or circumstance that enhances the impact of a specific reason or factor.

Here are some specific differences between the machine and reference translations:

* The machine-generated text renders ""realiseerimise aspektist"". as ""From the point of view of the reorganisation of the offence"" while the reference version has ""From the point of view of the realisation of the necessary elements of an offence"". The reference version is more precise and accurate in conveying the meaning of the original.
* The word ""materjali"" is mistranslated in the machine-generated text as ""material"" while the reference has ""necessary elements of an offence"" which is more accurate.

In summary, the reference version of the text is more precise and accurate in conveying the meaning of the original compared to the machine-generated one. The reference also conveys the meaning of the original in a more nuanced and faithful manner.

 Both the reference and machine translations convey the same overall meaning, but there are some differences in wording and style.

The source text in Estonian mentions that ""Selle auks peab märkima"" which literally translates to ""it is worth marking this trait of human nature/essence/characteristic/feature/appearance/form/quality (in this context, it refers to the image of human nature that inspired political liberalism).""

The reference English version translates this as ""It should be noted in its honour that it was this image of human nature that inspired political liberalism.""

However, the machine-generated English version interprets the same phrase differently, as ""It should be noted as an honour that it was this image of human nature that inspired political liberalism.""

The reference version is more elegant and natural-sounding in English, while the machine-generated one is somewhat awkward and wordy. Additionally, the reference version is more precise in conveying the idea of noting something in tribute, whereas the machine-generated one implies that it is an honorable or admirable occurrence. Overall, the reference version is more nuanced and accurate in expressing the intended meaning.

In the reference Translation, ""The Royal Military College prepares the Army officers"", the nuance of the source text is captured well. The subject of the sentence is ""The Royal Military College "" and the verb ""prepares"" is used. ""The"" refers to the ""Army officers "" and ""officers"" is the equivalent of ""ohvitserkonda "" in the original text.

However, in the machine Translation, ""a land-force officer "" is used to translate ""maavägede ohvitserkonda"", which is not accurate. The nuance of the reference Translation is not captured, as the subject of the sentence is ""a "" and not ""the "" as it should be.

The machine translation is ""The number of people who are usually the most vulnerable is cared for.""

The reference translation is ""Love for people is usually cared for the most.""

Comparing the machine and reference translations, the primary difference is that the machine version conveys the idea of caring for a ""number of people,"" whereas the reference version refers to caring for ""love for people"" or a love of humanity.

The source and reference versions both use the word ""hoolitakse"" (cared for/supported in Estonian) but the subject of that action differs. The source and reference also use the word ""isikud"" (people in Estonian) but the reference expands on this to refer specifically to a ""love of people/humanity"" (inest inimeste armastus in Estonian, lit. ""love for people-gen.pl people-pl"").

Therefore, the machine version is different from the reference in that it lacks the reference to the love of humanity and instead refers to caring for a ""number of people"" which is not an exact equivalent to the original meaning.

To improve the quality of the machine-generated version. A more accurate and nuanced version could be:

""The love for people is usually shown the most care.""

2. The word ""otsustusvõimetus"" is rendered as ""indecision"" in the reference and ""indecisiveness"" in the machine-generated version.

The word ""indecisiveness"" is a more fitting equivalent to ""otsustusvõimetus"" as it is a more general and more commonly used word in English.

The word ""indecision"" is a more specific and less commonly used word in English, and it is not a good equivalent to ""otsustusvõimetus"" as it is not a very fitting equivalent to the original word.

The correct spelling of the word is ""indecisiveness"" and it is spelled that way in the reference.

 The machine translation and reference transformation share similar meanings, but there are some differences in wording. Here are the main differences:

1. Word choice: In the reference translation, the term ""opposed"" is used to describe the reaction of the 19th-century physiologists to Hermann von Helmholtz's idea. The machine translation uses ""opposed"" as well, but it also includes ""much"" which is not present in the reference.
2. Specificity: The reference is more specific in describing the subject of the opposition, stating that the 19th-century physiologists opposed the idea that ""physical experiments"" could shed light on their field. The machine-generated version is less specific, simply stating that ""physical tests"" could shed some insight.
3. Slight rephrasing: The reference rephrases the original sentence slightly, using ""that"" to introduce the idea of the physical experiments. The machine-generated version is closer to the original, but it rephrases the word ""shed"" to ""heita,"" which is a less common synonym in English.

In summary, the reference and the machine-generated version convey the same meaning, but the reference is more precise and specific in its word choices.

 The machine translation ""The negotiations with Botvinia and Kenya on the World Cup are ongoing"" differs from the reference translation ""Alekhin's negotiations with Botvinnik and Keres about the world championship matches are disrupted"" in a few ways.

First, the machine translation uses the present continuous tense ""are ongoing,"" while the reference.. uses the present perfect tense ""are disrupted.""

Second, the machine incorrectly identifies ""Botvinnikuga"" and ""Keresega"" as place names (e.g. ""Botvinia"" and ""Kenya"") and mistranslates them as proper nouns. The reference correctly identifies them as the names of two famous chess players, Mikhail Botvinnik and Paap Krace ""Keresega"" (Penttala Keres in Estonian language, a.k.a. Paul Keres in English language).

Thus, the correct English version of the Estonian sentence is: ""Alekhin's negotiations with Botvinnik and Keres about the world championship matches are disrupted.""

The error in the machine-generated version is likely due to the lack of context and the fact that the proper noun ""Botvinnikuga"" and ""Keresega"" are not in the dictionary. Therefore, the system may not have been able to recognize them as proper noun and instead treated them as common noun. Additionally, the lack of context makes it difficult for the system to infer the correct tense, and thus, it defaults to the present continuous tense.

The only minor difference is the word ""põhjustatud"" in the Estonian source, which is left untranslated in the reference English text but is reflected in the machine-generated English text as ""caused by industry and vehicles"".

The word ""põhjustatud"" is an adjective meaning ""caused by, originating from, attributable to, ascribable to, referable to, referable, trace(abl)e to, track(abl)e to, tracked to, trackingly due to, trackingly attributable to "" and is used in the Estonian source to specify the source of the air and water pollution.

The machine translation provided is: ""The main responsibility of the facilitator is to pay the Agency a fee, the size of which is usually agreed by the parties to the agreement.""

The reference translation is: ""The main responsibility of the mandator is to pay the agent a fee, the amount of which is usually agreed in the contract between the parties.""

When comparing the machine and reference translations, the main difference is the role or title of the person or entity responsible for paying the fee. The machine.

In the source and reference texts, the responsible party is referred to as ""käsundiandja"" and ""mandatary"" respectively, which both refer to a person or entity that has been authorized to act on behalf of someone else. However, the machine incorrectly renders this as ""facilitator"" while the reference correctly renders it as ""the mandator/the person or entity that has been authorized to act on behalf of someone else's behalf ""

The second difference is the object of the responsibility, the fee is referred to as ""tasu"" in the original and the reference, but the machine incorrectly renders it as ""agency fee ""

The reference to the ""agreement/lepingus kokku lepivad "" is translated correctly in the reference and the machine.

Overall, the reference and the machine are quite similar in the meaning, but the machine is not accurate in the identification of the responsible party and the object of the responsibility.

 Both the machine and reference Translation seem to convey the same meaning. The source language (Estonian) text ""Inimeste väärtuse kohta on võimalikud kaks hoiakut"" when translated into English literally means ""speaking of the value of humans, there are two possible approaches"".

However. the machine and reference English translations differ slightly in their usage of articles. The reference English text omits articles and simply says ""There are two possible approaches to the value of human beings"", while the machine-generated text includes the indefinite article ""two possible approaches to **the** value of human beings"".

In this specific context, the reference English text is more accurate, as the omission of articles emphasizes the general concept of ""value of human beings"" and avoids suggesting the existence of specific instances of ""the value of human beings"".

Firstly, the subject of the sentence in the machine translation is ""the attack by the military,"" whereas in the reference translation, the subject is ""the attack by the cavalry."" The distinction is important, as the source text specifies that the cavalry was involved in the attack, and the cavalry is a more precise subject than simply ""the military.""

""Egotism"" refers to an unreasonable belief in one's own importance or abilities, while ""egocentricity"" refers to an excessive preoccupation with oneself and one's own interests.

Secondly, the verb tense used in the machine's translation is inconsistent. The verb ""was"" is used twice in the subject-verb agreement, but the reference version only uses ""was"" for the first instance and ""unable"" for the second instance.

Finally, the reference version has a more concise and clear meaning, as it combines the ideas of ""egocentricity"" and ""unable to care for the feelings of others"" in a single phrase.

Upon closer examination. the only notable difference between the two translations is the use of commas. In the reference translation, there is a comma after ""Benazir Bhutto"" while in the machine translation, there is no comma.

The use of commas in English can affect the meaning or clarity of a sentence, but in this particular context, the absence of a comma does not significantly change the meaning or clarity of the sentence.

However, the reference version has translated it as ""inciting riots"". In this context, the reference version is more accurate, as the word ""incitement"" implies an intent to cause unrest, whereas ""inciting riots"" directly refers to the action of causing unrest.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close in meaning to the original Estonian source text. However, there are some slight differences between the two translations.

The machine translation renders ""abduktsioon"" as ""abduction"" while the reference translation renders it as ""deliberation"" or ""consideration"". According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the noun ""abduction"" refers to the action of taking someone away by force or illegal means, or the fact of being taken away in this way. In contrast, ""deliberation"" refers to careful and thorough consideration or discussion of a topic or subjects.

In this context, ""abduktsioon"" refers to a process of evaluating a certain idea or concept, which is more accurately conveyed by the term ""deliberation"" or ""consideration"" in English. Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text.

Moreover, the phrase ""me võtame teatud propositsiooni vastu kui hüpoteesi"" in the original text is rendered as ""we accept a certain proposition as a hypothesis"" in the machine and reference translation. However, the word ""accept"" in the English language can have different connotations, depending on the context. In this case, the word ""accept"" implies a passive acceptance of a fact or idea, whereas the word ""recognise"" in the reference translation implies a more active engagement with the idea, which is more in line with the meaning of the original text.

In summary. the reference translation is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text, particularly in the use of the word ""deliberation"" and the verb ""recognise"" to convey the meaning of the original text.

Here's the breakdown of the differences:

1. The verb ""usub"" in the original sentence is translated as ""believes"" in the machine and reference translations. However, the context suggests that the person in question not only believes. but **knows** that his worth or value has **increased**.

2. The phrase ""kedagi, kellel on üldtunnustatult väga kõrge väärtusaste"" literally means ""those, for whom is recognized a very high value in general/on the whole/as a whole (üldtunnustatult)"".

 The machine translation ""The average school's 'golden' certificate was released from the entry examinations"" is different from the reference translation ""The 'golden' certificate of the upper secondary school exempted him from admission examinations"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the machine translation uses the phrase ""the average school's 'golden' certificate"" while the reference translation refers to a ""upper secondary school's 'golden' certificate"". ""Average school"" gives an impression of a general or mediocre school while ""upper secondary school"" refers to a specific level of education in the education system.

Secondly, the machine translation uses the passive voice. ""was released"" implies that the certificate released itself, whereas the reference translation uses the active voice ""exempted him from admission examinations"" which implies that the person in question received the exemption due to the possession of the ""golden"" certificate.

Overall, the reference translation conveys a more precise and clear meaning compared to the machine translation. The reference accurately refers to the specific level of education and the person benefiting from the exemption, while the machine-generated version is vague and unclear. Additionally, the reference's use of the active voice makes the sentence more direct and engaging.

 The machine translation seems to have mistranslated a few words in the original Estonian sentence, leading to some inaccuracies in the final sentence.

1. ""Ta lükkas oma esimese etenduse"" is translated as ""He postponed his first performance"" in the reference, while the machine incorrectly renders it as ""He kicked his first performance.""

2. ""ning kandis siis"" is translated as ""and then performed"" in the reference, but the machine mistranslates it as ""and then appealed to the Wagner 'Reinikulla' and 'Valletta' in Hungarian.""

3. The reference correctly identifies the two works by Wagner as ""Rheingold"" and ""Valkyrie"", but the machine incorrectly renders ""Reinikulla"" and ""Valküüri"" in Hungarian.

Overall, the reference is more accurate and coherent in conveying the meaning of the original sentence. The machine's attempt contains errors in the interpretation of the words and phrases, resulting in a less accurate and confusing output.

 The source text in Estonian mentions ""armastada"" which means ""to love"" in this context. Both the machine and reference translations translate this word as ""to love"" in English.

However, the main difference between the two translations is in the use of the word ""merge"" in the machine-generated version. The original Estonian sentence does not mention ""merging"" or any related concept, so the inclusion of this word in the machine-generated version is inaccurate and unrelated to the original meaning.

The reference version correctly interprets the original meaning of the text, which is to deny the requirement to love at all, and accurately reflects the original meaning of the text.

In summary. the main discrepancy between the two versions is the addition of the word ""merge"" in the machine-generated one, which is not present in the original and changes the meaning of the sentence.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea that the president, through his spokesperson. made an announcement regarding not accepting the prime minister's request. However, there is a subtle difference in the wording used.

The word ""meet"" in the machine-generated translation implies a physical or virtual encounter, whereas the word ""accept"" in the reference human-generated translation implies receiving or responding to a request or proposal. In this context, the reference human-generated version is more accurate as it conveys the meaning of considering or accepting the Prime Minister's request, rather than merely meeting the person. Therefore, the machine-generated version slightly differs from the reference in meaning, and the reference is a better reflection of the intended meaning.

Additionally, the verb tense in the machine-generated sentence differs from the reference and the original, as it uses the future tense ""will find"" while the reference and the original use the present tense ""find/leiavad"".

In the reference translation, ""a relocation scheme for 120,000 refugees"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, emphasizing the number of refugees and the plan for them. In contrast, the machine-generated version starts with ""at the meeting, ministers approved a relocation scheme of 120,000 refugees,"" emphasizing the event and the participants, before specifying the details of the plan and the related quotas.

Although the meaning conveyed in the machine-generated version is still clear, the reference version's word order is more accurate to the original Estonian sentence, as it emphasizes the key information and maintains fluency in the target language. Therefore, the reference version is preferable to the machine-generated one.

Finally, the verb tense used in the machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense. A more accurate English translation of the original text would be ""Mill argues that these are the empirical rules of physical combination and separation."" Overall, the reference translation is closer to the original meaning of the text than the machine translation.

 The machine translation and the reference translation differ in the wording used to describe the ""fundamental principles"" of Lakatos' research programme. The machine translation uses the phrase ""were described in... as the core..."", while the reference translation uses ""called... the hard core of..."".

Furthermore, the machine translation renders ""uurimisprogrammi"". as ""of the reseach programme"", whereas the reference translation has ""of the reserach program"".

Overall, the machine translation is readable but lacks the precision and nuance of the reference Translation. The reference Translation conveys the idea that Lakatos considered the fundamental principles to be a crucial and unchanging part of the re-serach programme, while the machine Translation is somewhat vague on this point.

The main difference is that the machine-generated text mentions the ""use of cafés to sell cannabis to foreign tourists,"" whereas the reference text mentions ""visits to the cafés that sell cannabis to foreign tourists.""

The distinction here is subtle but important. The reference text suggests that the law specifically targets visits to these establishments, whereas the machine-generated text implies that the law targets the use of the establishments for the purpose of selling cannabis to tourists.

A careful evaluation of the reference and the source confirms that the reference is a more accurate reflection of the meaning of the original text. Therefore, the reference is the more appropriate of the two in this case.

The reference and machine translations both convey the meaning of ""The increase in industrial production was also accompanied by,"" but the reference omits the word ""production/performance"" and simply says ""The increase in industrial...was also accompanied by.""

2. The reference and machine both use slightly different word choices for the phrase ""the Moscow Oblast city with the fastest-growing population."" The reference simply says ""Moscow Obolt"" (a colloquial/slightly inaccurate term for ""Moscow region"" or ""Moscow oblast"") and the word ""city"" is implied but not explicitly stated. The machine, on the other hand, spells out ""Moscow Obolt (Oblast)"" and ""city with the fastest-growing population"" is used.

3. The reference and machine also differ slightly in the way they convey the meaning of ""kõige kiiremini kasvava elanikkonna"" (with the fastest-growing population). The reference simply says ""the fastest-growing population"" while the machine specifies ""city with the fastest-growing population.""

Overall, the reference and machine convey the same meaning, but the reference is slightly more concise and omits some of the more specific details that the machine includes. The reference also assumes more knowledge of the region and the context, as it simply refers to ""Moscow Obolt"" without specifying that it is a region or an ""oblast"" (a federal subject of Russia, similar to a province or state in the U.S.). The machine, on the other hand, is more explicit and spells everything out. Neither is necessarily ""better"" than the other, but the reference is slightly more concise and assumes more knowledge of the context.

 The source text is in Estonian and the task is to evaluate the quality of the English translation provided by a machine. The reference translation is also given for comparison.

The source text is discussing fictitious letters written by or to a particular person, and notes that these letters show that ""küünikud"" (cynics. * * in Estonian) wanted to portray this person as a ""forerunner"" or ""predecessor"" of their ""suuna"" (literally ""direction"" or ""tendency"" in Estonian).

The machine-generated English translation is not far off, but it contains a few errors. First, the pronouns ""temalt"" (from him, literally) and ""tahtsid"" (to him, literally) are mistranslated as ""him and him,"" which is confusing. A better translation might be ""letters sent by or to him.""

Second, the word ""küünikud"" (cynics. * * in Estonian) is translated here as ""cynics,"" but a more appropriate translation might be ""followers of a particular school of thought or ideology"" or simply ""proonents of a certain tendency or direction of thought "" to convey the original meaning of the word in the Estonian text.

Finally, the word ""eelkäijad"" (for runners, literally ""precedessors"" in Estonian) is not well translated as ""forerunner of their direction "" in the English text. A more accurate rendering might be ""a predecessor of their ideology "" or ""a forbear of their tendency "" to convey the meaning of the word in the original.

The reference English text is more accurate in conveying the intended meaning of the original, but it is not perfect. A more precise and clear English version might be: ""Many of the fictitious letters sent to or from him circulating at the time show that the proonents of a certain ideology wanted to depict him as a forerunner of their ideology. ""

In summary, the machine-generated English text contains some errors in translation, but conveys the overall meaning of the original. The reference English version is more precise, but still not entirely accurate. A more careful and nuanced human-generated English version is needed to fully convey the meaning of the original.

1. Word order: The machine-translation inverts the word order of the original Estonian sentence, leading to a slightly awkward phrasing in English. A better wording might be: ""Romantic love is a kind of friendship, and friendship can be as passionate and committed as romantic love.""

2. Consistency: The reference translation consistently refers to love and friendship as ""can be...as passionate and committed as"", while the machine-translation only refers to friendship as being ""as passionate and committed as romantic love"".

3. Use of articles: The reference-translation correctly includes articles (""a"" and ""as"") in the phrase ""a kind of friendship"" and ""as passionate and committed as romantic love"", while the machine-translation omits the articles.

The machine translation is largely accurate, capturing the main ideas of the source text. However, there is one key difference between the machine translation and the reference translation.

In the source and reference translation, the term ""Second Bulgarian Empire/federal state"" is used to refer to the historical entity in question. However, the machine translation refers to a ""Bulgarian federal state,"" which is not an accurate translation of the original term.

The reference translation correctly translates the term as ""Second Bulgarian Empire,"" which is the commonly used and historically accurate name for the entity by which the original text refers.

Comparing the two translations, the main difference is that the machine-generated text refers to ""new storms and wind flags"" while the reference text refers to ""new towers and vanes.""

A careful analysis of the source sentence in Estonian reveals that the word ""torni"" (pl. ""tornid"") is mistranslated as ""storms"" in the machine-generated text. A more accurate rendering of ""torni"" in this context is ""towers"" or ""spires"" as in the reference text.

The word ""tuulelipu"" is correctly identified as ""vanes"" in the reference text.

The word ""only"" implies that the dramatic situation worsened on the specific occasion when Napoleon sent the expedition, as opposed to at any other time. However, the source text does not make this distinction, and the word ""only"" is not present in the original text.

The machine incorrectly translated ""Rootsi"" and ""Taani"" as ""Swedish"" and ""Danish"" respectively, which lack articles.

2. Word choice: The machine incorrectly used the word ""syndrome"" to translate ""dünastia"" (dynasty) and ""1387 välja"" (died out in 1387).

3. Sentence structure: The machine incorrectly combined the two separate events of the unions in 1319 and 1380 in the same clause, separated by a comma. A better approach is to use two separate clauses, as in the reference.

A more accurate and readable English version of the source is:

The dynasty of the Norwegian kings was merged with the one in Sweden in 1319 and with the one in Denmark in 1380, and it ceased to exist in 1387.

Firstly, the machine translation uses ""It must aim more closely"". The reference translation states ""He believes that the immediate goal of the Order is"", which conveys the same meaning but in a more natural and clear way.

The reference translation correctly translates the Estonian phrase ""presidendina jõustusid alles 11. mail"" as ""Presidential mandate entered into force only on 11 May."" The word ""presidendina"" here means ""Presidential"" and ""jõustusid alles"" here means ""entered into force.""

The machine-generated translation incorrectly includes ""of Nhamadjo"" after ""President"" in the English version. ""Nhamadjo"" is the name of the individual who assumed the presidency, but it is not a part of the title ""President"" and should not be included in the English version.

Overall, the reference and machine-generated versions differ in the inclusion of the proper noun ""Nhamadjo"" in the machine-generated version. The reference correctly excludes the proper noun, as it is not a component of the official title.

The main difference is in the word ""segiajamisel"" in the original Estonian source, by analyzing this specific word we can conclude that the correct translation is ""confusion"" and not ""adventures"" as the machine has translated.

The word ""segiajamisel"" is derived from the Estonian word ""segija"" which means ""to confuse"" and thus the correct interpretation of the word in the context of the sentence is confusion.

The reference Translation is accurate and reflects the intended meaning of the original sentence. The word ""confusion"" is the correct interpretation of the word ""segiajamisel"" and fits well in the context of the sentence.

The machine Translation, on the other side, is not accurate and it's not reflecting the intended meaning of the sentence. The word ""adventures"" is not an appropriate interpretation of the word ""segiajamisel"" and it doesn't fit in the context of the sentence.

It's important to note that, in this specific case, the reference Translation is accurate and the machine Translation is not, this is because the reference Translation was done by a human and the machine Translation was done by a machine, and the human can understand the nuances of the language and the cultural context, while the machine can't.

Finally, the verb ""jätkata"" is incorrect in the machine's rendering. A more accurate rendering of the verb in this context is ""carry on"" or ""continue"" (the crsusade/the fight/the campaign, as mentioned above).

Overall, the reference's rendering is more accurate and clear in meaning. The machine's version contains errors in wording and meaning, and lacks the precision and nuance of the reference.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, but the reference version is more precise in expressing what has happened to the forest (it has been cut down, not just taken off). Also, the word ""moreshtast"" in the original text is likely a colloquial or regional variation of ""meelne alla taast"" (lit. ""felled to the ground""), which is closer in meaning to ""cut down"" in this context. Therefore, a more accurate and nuanced English translation of the original text would be:

Machine Translation: In Georgia, the Commander of the Defence Force, Georgi Kalandadze, was arrested at night and was suspected of crossing the borders of power.

Reference Translation: In Georgia, the Commander of the Joint Headquarters of the Defence
Forces, Georgi Kalandadze, was arrested under the suspicion of acting in
excess of his powers.

The source and reference text both refer to an event in which a person by the name of Georgi Kalandadze, who is the head of the Georgian military, has been arrested. However, the machine-generated text differs in several ways from the reference text, indicating a less accurate and less nuanced rendering of the meaning of the original.

1. Role of the arrested person: The reference text specifies that Kalandadze was the ""Commander of the Joint Headquarters of the Defence
Forces"" while the machine-generated one refers to him as simply the ""Commander of the
Defence Force"".

2. Suspicion of wrong-doing: The reference text states that the suspicion against Kalandadze was related to ""acting in
excess of his powers"" while the machine-generated version refers to ""crossing the
borders of power"" which is less clear and less precise.

3. The tense of the verb: The reference text is written in the past tense, consistent with the fact that the
arrest has already taken place, while the machine-generated one is in the present
perfect tense, which is less appropriate for the context.

Overall, the reference text is more precise, nuanced, and accurate in rendering the meaning of the original, and the machine-generated version contains errors and lacks clarity in comparison. Therefore, the quality of the machine-generated version is lower than the reference text.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same basic information as the original Estonian sentence. However, there are some minor differences between the two translations.

The main difference is that the machine translation uses the passive voice in the phrase ""vehicles burned,"" whereas the reference translation uses the passive voice in the phrase ""vehicles caught fire."" While both phrases convey the same idea, the reference translation is more precise about *how* the vehicles were damaged.

Additionally, the reference translation includes a hyphen in the phrase ""since inimest"" (which translates to ""and seventeen people"" in English), whereas the machine translation does not. This is a minor punctuation difference that does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but the reference translation is more precise in some areas. A human evaluator might rate the quality of the machine-generated text as ""Good Enough"" or ""Fair,"" depending on the specific evaluation criteria used.

The machine-generated translation is ""One of the main preoccupations for Egena was the German Order and its branch of Libya.""

The reference human-generated,-made, however, is ""One of the main contenders for Estonia was the Teutonic Order and its Livonian branch.""

Comparing the two, the primary difference is that the machine-generated version confuses the ""German Order and its branch of Libya"" when the reference is to the ""Teutonic Order and its Livonian branch.""

The source mentions ""Saksa ordu ja selle Liivimaa haru,"" which is a reference to the ""German (Saksa) Order (Ordu) and its Livonian (Liivimaa) branch (haru).""

The reference correctly interprets this to refer to the ""Teutonic (German) Order (Ordu) and its Livonian (Liivimaa) branch.""

The inaccuracy in the machine-generated version is likely due to confusion between ""Saksa"" (German in Estonian) and ""Libya"" (Libya in Estonian) as well as the conflation of ""Liivimaa"" (referring to the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order) and ""haru"" (branch in this context) with ""Libya"" (a different geographical location altogether).

Therefore, the reference is more accurate in conveying the intended meaning of the original text.

 The machine translation ""It is currently mainly trusted by highly optimistic markists, who are in favour of its materialistic version"" differs from the reference translation ""It is currently mainly trusted only by highly optimistic Marxists, who are in favour of its materialistic version"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the phrase ""seda usaldavad"" in the original Estonian has been translated as ""is currently mainly trusted by"" in the machine-generated version, whereas the reference version has ""is currently mainly trusted only by."" The addition of the word ""only"" here adds more emphasis to the exclusivity of the individuals who trust the concept, and thus aligns more closely with the intended meaning of the original text.

Second, the word ""marksiistid"" in the original has been mistranslated as ""markists"" in the machine-generated version, whereas the reference version has ""Marxists"" with a capital ""M."" While the distinction between ""markist"" and ""Marxist"" may seem minor, the latter is more appropriate in this context as it refers to individuals who subscribe to the political and economic theories of Karl Marx.

Finally, the word ""pooldavad"" in the original has been incorrectly rendered as ""pooldavad"" in the machine-generated version. The correct spelling of the word is ""pooltavad"" in Estonian, meaning ""who are in favor of.""

Overall. the reference version provides a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the original text, highlighting the exclusivity of the individuals who trust the concept and the specificity of the political and economic theory they subscribe to.

 The machine translation ""However, not as if the only one had hoped"" is somewhat different in meaning from the reference translation ""However, not exactly as Aino had hoped.""

The main difference is that the machine-generated translation uses the phrase ""as if"" which is not present in the reference version. The word ""as if"" can imply a comparison or a hypothetical situation, whereas the reference version conveys a sense of deviation from expectations.

Moreover, the word ""only one"" in the machine-generated version is not an accurate reflection of the original text, which is ""siiski"" in Estonian, meaning ""just, merely, only, simply, or even quite.""

The reference version is more precise and closer to the intended meaning of the original, as it conveys that the outcome was not exactly what Aino had hoped for. Therefore, the reference version is a better reflection of the original meaning.

The source and reference texts both use the term ""hoiuste avamise"" to refer to the action of opening a deposit. However, the machine translation only includes the word ""opening"" and omits the word ""deposits"" entirely.

The reference and source texts both use the plural form of ""deposits"" (in English and in the original language, respectively), but the machine-generated version omits the word altogether.

Therefore, the reference and source texts convey the meaning that the branch stopped registering new customers and opening new deposits, but the machine-generated text only conveys the meaning that the branch stopped registering new customers and opening something, leaving the meaning of ""opening"" ambiguous.

The machine translation states that the Estonian maternal welfare index is the ""10th most important"" in the world, while the reference translation says it is ""ranked 10th"" in the world.

The phrase ""most important"" in the machine translation may imply that the index measures the quality or significance of maternal welfare in different countries. However, the original text does not suggest this meaning. The reference translation correctly conveys the meaning of the original text by stating that the index is ranked 10th, without implying any judgment of its significance.

In the reference English text, the verb ""was"" is used in the simple past tense, consistent with the original text.

However, the machine-generated text uses the present perfect tense, ""was common practice,"" suggesting that the action was completed in the past and has relevance to the present.

However, the reference translation provided is ""It must therefore be beyond empirical definitions.""

When comparing the two translations. We can observe that the machine-generated one uses the term ""cross-border"" which is not present in the reference version. The word ""empiriilise määratlusi"" in the original text refers to empirical definitions, and the term ""beyond empirical definitions"" in the reference version captures the meaning of the original text more accurately.

Moreover, the reference version conveys the idea of something that goes beyond empirical knowledge or evidence, while the machine-generated one simply suggests a ""cross-border"" concept, which is less precise and does not convey the intended meaning.

In summary, the primary difference between the two versions is that the reference version captures the meaning of the original text by using the phrase ""beyond empirical definitions"" to refer to something that transcends empirical knowledge, while the machine-generated one does not. Therefore, the reference version is a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the meaning of the original text.

Firstly, the possessive form ""Canberra's"" is not necessary in the machine translation, as the original Estonian sentence does not use a possessive form. A more accurate translation would be ""Canberra day"" or ""the day of Canberra"" instead of ""Canberra's day"".

Secondly, the phrase ""in Celebrate Canberra"" is not quite accurate. The Estonian sentence uses the genitive form of the word ""celebrate"" to indicate that the ten-day series of events is part of the Celebrate Canberra festival.

The source mentions ""Siseminister Arsen Avakovi nõuniku,"" which translates to ""Interior Minister Arsen Avakov"" in the reference version, not ""Mr Arsen Offkov's adviser"" as in the machine one.

The inaccuracy in the machine-generated text likely arises from confusion between the words ""nõunik"" (Estonian for ""interventionist, one who intervenes"") and ""minister"" (a person who holds a government department portfolio). The system seems to have mistaken the adviser for the interior minster, resulting in a less accurate and confusing translation.

Moreover, the system also misspelled the name ""Arsen Avakov"" as ""Arsen Offkov"" in the generated text. This mistake could be due to the system's poor handling of Cyrillic characters, as the correct spelling of the name is of Cyrillic origin.

Overall, the system failed to recognize the correct roles of the individuals involved, resulting in a less precise and accurate output. Additionally, the poor handling of Cyrillic characters might have contributed to the confusion.

Firstly, the machine translation takes the phrase ""kahemeetrine kangatükk"". which means ""a piece of cloth or leather attached to a garment as an ornament or for protection, typically worn on the front of a skirt by Estonian women"" ( according to Eesti keel IstermPUK) and interprets it as a two-meter-long carpet, while the reference interprets it as a two-meter-long piece of cloth or material worn on a skirt.

Second, the verb tense in the machine-generated sentence is present continuous, ""is being carried on the skirts"", while the reference sentence is in the present tense, ""is worn on the skirt"".

Overall, the reference and the machine-generated sentence differ in meaning, with the reference being more accurate to the intended meaning of the original text. The reference correctly interprets the ""kangeitükk"" as a type of material attached to a garment, while the machine-generated sentence misinterprets it as a two-meter-carpet.

A corrected, more idiomatic English translation of the original Estonian sentence, which aligns more closely with the reference, would be:

""Mathematicians had always been interested in the properties of curves, but now it turned out that they are important for physics.""

The original Estonian sentence literally says ""curved properties interested always the mathematicians, but now turned out that for physics they are important."" The word ""kaevused/curved properties"" is the subject of the sentence, and the word ""mathematicians/mahematikud"" is in the genitive case, acting as the possessor of the ""interested properties/kaevused omadused.""

However, the focus of the sentence is the fact that the ""properties of the curve/curved properties"" (not the ""mathematicians/mahematikud"") is what is important for ""physics/füüsika.""

The reference and corrected English sentences reflect this distinction, but the original machine-generated English sentence does not.

The reference and corrected English sentences:

1. ""Mathematicians had always been interested in the properties of curves, but now it turned out that they are important for physics.""

The inaccurate machine-generated English sentence:

1. ""Mathematics were always interested in the properties of the curve, but now it turned out that they are important for physics.""

The word ""mathematics"" is singular and should be paired with the singular verb ""was"" (not ""were/were interested""). Additionally, the word ""curve/curve's properties"" is the correct antecedent for ""they"" in the dependent clause, not ""mathematics/mathematics.""

The source text uses the phrase ""Portugalist majanduslikult, sõjaliselt ja poliitiliselt maailma juhtiv riik"" to describe how Portugal became a world leader in economic, military, and political spheres.

The machine-generated translation renders this as ""Portugal became a world leader economically, militarily and politically.""

The reference-quality human-generated version sticks very closely to the word order and phrasing of the original, rendering it as ""Portugal became a world leader economically, militarily and politically.""

The subtle but important difference here is that the reference-level version repeats the word ""Portugal"" at the beginning of each item in the triplet (e.g. ""Portugalist majanduslikult"" = ""economically, Portugal""). The machine-generated version omits this redundancy, and simply lists the three areas in which Portugal became a world leader.

While the omission of the redundant ""Portugal"" in the machine-generated version doesn't fundamentally change the meaning of the sentence, it does make the wording slightly less literal and less word-for-word. Depending on the desired level of literalness, this could be seen as a difference in the quality of the two competing versions.

Firstly, the machine translation translates ""Kuberneripuu"".as ""Siberian trees"" while the reference translation has it as ""Julbernardia trees"". ""Kuberneripuu"" is actually a term used to refer to a specific type of tree found in the Congo Basin and West Africa, not Siberia.

Secondly, the machine Translation confuses ""akatsiad"" which means ""platou"" or ""platood"" in English as ""posters"" while the reference correctly interprets it as ""platou"" or ""platoods/platous/plat easeauds ""

Thus, a more accurate machine-generated or human-generated Estonian-to-English Translation of the provided sentence is:

""Julbernaria trees are growing on plateaus, acacias, baobabs, and combrets on more fertile soil.""

 The machine translation ""The suspicion does not stem from the causes, but creates the causes"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""Love does not come from reason, but creates reason.""

The main issue is that the machine translation uses the word ""suspicion"". However, the original Estonian sentence does not use the word for suspicion, but for love (armastus in Estonian, suspicion in English, rakkaus in Finnish, etc.).

The word suspicion in the machine-generated sentence is not just a simple mistranslation, but it completely changes the meaning of the original sentence.

Moreover, the verb tulene (stem from, come from) is incorrect in the machine-generated sentence. The verb ""tulene"" is not transated as ""create"" in the reference or the machine-generated sentence.

The reference translation into English is: ""Gabon's writers write almost exclusively in French.""

When comparing the machine and reference translations to the original Estonian text, we can observe that the machine and reference translations are very similar and both convey the correct meaning.

However, there is a slight variation between the two English translations. In the machine-generated version, the possessive s after ""Gabon"" is missing, whereas in the reference version, it is present.

The possessive s is necessary to indicate that Gabon is the country whose writers write almost exclusively in French. Therefore, the reference version is more accurate and conveys the intended meaning more clearly.

The main difference is that the machine-generated version includes the word ""the"" twice before ""State of Washington,"" while the reference version only includes it once. In this context, including the article before ""Washington"" in the first instance is unnecessary and slightly awkward.

Additionally, the reference version includes a comma after ""United States,"" which is not present in the original text or the machine-generated version. While commas can be used differently in Estonian and English, in this case, including the extra punctuation in the reference version helps to clarify the meaning and improve readability.

The machine translation into English is ""The new viruses include viruses that have infected family crews for a relatively short time.""

The reference translation into English is ""The new viruses include viruses that have infected host species for a relatively short period of time.""

When comparing the machine and reference English translations, the primary difference is that the machine version refers to ""family crews"" being infected, while the reference version refers to ""host species"" being infected.

A correct and more accurate English version of the original Estonian source would be ""The new group of viruses includes those that have recently infected their respective host species for a relatively short time period.""

The word ""peremeesliike"" in the original Estonian is a compound word meaning ""host-species"" and the word ""nakk"" in the original text is a verb meaning ""infected/infects"" and not ""naeratakse"" (literally ""is infected/are infected"" in the present perfect tense in Estonian, as used in the reference English version).

Therefore, the original meaning of the Estonian text is that the new set of recently discovered or emerging viruses are those that have infected their specific ""peremees"" (i.e., host-species, not ""families"" or ""crews"") for a relatively short time.

On the other hand, the machine translation seems to interpret the meaning of the word as ""an occurrence or an event that happens or takes place physically or mentally in a person or a group of people "" which is not the correct interpretation in this context.

""Plahvatas teeäärne pomm"" is a more literal, word-for-word translation of the original, meaning ""along the road edge bomb/blast/explosion."" ""Along the roadside/edge/edge of the road"" is more idiomatic and common in English, hence the reference's use of ""roadside bomb/explosive/blast/etc.""

Second, the machine incorrectly used the present tense ""launched a"" in its first clause, while the reference correctly used the past tense ""commenced"" to reflect the fact that the exercise has already started.

Finally, the machine incorrectly used the word ""Union for Defence"" in its first clause, while the reference correctly used ""Defence League"" to reflect the original ""Kaitseliit"", which is the name of the Estonian national defence organization.

In contrast, the reference correctly used the term ""three-day training exercise of the Defence League,"", and placed it at the beginning of the sentence, which is more consistent with the original.

The system seems to have mistranslated ""tekitajad/recruits/conscripts/draftees/enlistees/etc."" as ""paints"" (most likely due to the similarity in spelling between ""tekitajad/recruits/conscripts/draftees/enlistees/etic."" and ""tegutajad/paints/coats/varnishes/finishers/stains/lacquers/paintbrushes/painters/paint-spray-guns/painting-contractors/painting-machines/painting-tools/painting-equipage/painting-gear/painting-appliances/painting-implements/painting-utensils/painting-devices/painting-contrivances/painting-mechanisms/painting-apparatus/painting-devices/painting-instruments/painting-outfits/painting-rigs/painting-rigs/painting-troops/painting-forces/painting-companies/painting-corps/painting-divisions/painting-regiments/painting-battalions/painting-brigades/painting-contributors/painting-performers/painting-players/painting-actors/painting-agents/painting-agencies/painting-agencies/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-agents/painting-ag

However, the machine translation uses the present tense ""are."" A more literal translation of the original Estonian might use the past tense, as in ""The majority of the Malawi people have been Christians,"" to reflect the Estonian use of ""on"" in the source sentence. This could imply that the majority of Malawians are historically or traditionally Christians.

 The source text in Estonian mentions ""teema"". The term ""teema"" in this context can be translated as ""asjad/things"" or ""topics/issues."" The machine and reference translations both chose to interpret ""teema"" as ""things/asjad"" in this instance, leading to the similar translations of ""erinevad asjad"" and ""different things/topics.""

However, the term ""monopogamy/non-monopogamy"" is not commonly used in English, and the reference text appears to have interpreted it as ""non-monogamy/monogamy relationships/arragements/structures."" The machine, on the other hand, interpreted it as ""monopogamy/non-monopogamy"" (a non-existent English word, but seemingly referring to a situation where one has a monopoly on something, in this case, relationships/partners).

The reference and machine-generated texts differ in the interpretation of the word ""monopogamy/non-monopogamy"" and the wording of the sentence. The reference text is more accurate in conveying the intended meaning of the original text, as it is more likely that the author meant ""relationship/partner-related monopoly/uniqueness/exclusivity"" (i.e., ""non-monogamy/monogamy relationships/arragements/structures"") and not ""one-pogamy/non-one-pogamy"" (a word that doesn't have a clear meaning in English, as generated by the machine text, and likely not the intended meaning of the original text either).

Therefore, the reference text is more accurate in this case, as it conveys the intended meaning of the original text more clearly and accurately.

 The source text is in Estonian and it states: ""Lillede ja loomade nautimine on nii ilmselt hea, et inimesed, kes seda teevad, võivad isegi imestada, et sellel on midagi pistmist voorusega.""

The machine Translation is: ""The enjoyment of chickens and animals is obviously so good that the people who do so may even be surprised that it has something to do with virtues.""

The reference Translation is: ""The enjoyment of flowers and animals is obviously so good that the people who do so may even be surprised that it has something to do with virtues.""

When comparing the machine and reference Translation, the main difference is that the machine Translation mentions ""chickens"" while the reference Translation mentions ""flowers.""

The source text, in fact, uses the word ""lilled"" which can be translated as either ""flowers"" or ""blossoms/buds"" depending on the context. In this context, it seems that the reference Translation used the meaning of ""blossoms/buds"" and the machine Translation used the meaning of ""flowers""

It is important to note that the word ""lillede"" is not used in the source, it is ""lilled"" (genitive singular of ""lillede/lilled/lillede"" depending on the case and number, in this case, it is in genitive singular, which is used to express possession, so it is translated as ""of flowers/of the flowers/of the bud/of the buds"" depending on the case and number of the word that will be used after ""lillede/lilled/lillede""

It is possible that the confusion comes from the similarity in the words ""lillede/lilled/lillede "" and ""lill"" (noun, singular, partitive) which means ""flower/s""

In any case, the meaning of the original sentence is not affected by this small difference, and the enjoyment of flowers and/ or buds is obviously so good that the people who do so may even be surprised that it has something to do with the merits.

262	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is somewhat close in meaning to the reference translation, but has a few differences. First. the machine version uses plural pronouns ""it"" and ""at all,"" while the reference translation uses singular ""he"" and ""an."" Second, the word order in the machine version diff Senems to be slightly awkward, with the phrase ""at all"" added and potentially altering the meaning. Finally, the reference translation uses the phrase ""entirely different relationship"" while the machine version simply says ""a different relationship with practice at all."" Overall, the reference version flows better and captures the meaning of the original text more accurately.

The source sentence in Estonian is: ""Kui ta seda viimast ei oleks, siis oleks tal teistsugune suhe praktikaga üldse.""

A more accurate machine-generated version might be: ""If it were not so, then his relationship with practice would be different.""

The reference English version is: ""If he was not the latter, he would have an entirely different relationship with practice.""

A more literal word-for-word version of the original Estonian might be: ""If this the last not is, then so strange relationship to practice with him would be.""

In this context, ""the latter"" refers to a hypothetical, unspecified referent, and the word ""strange"" in the word-for-word version is a somewhat loose equivalent to the word ""teistsugune"" in the original, meaning ""different in a certain way, peculiar, odd, strange, funny, funny, curious, remarkable, remarkable, interesting, extraordinary, unusual, singular, specific, characteristic,

A more straightforward word order, as in the reference version, can help clarify the meaning and improve the flow of the sentence.

3. Word omission: The word ""line"" or ""route"" is missing in the machine-generated version, which can make the meaning less clear. The reference version makes it clear that a line or route branches off at Nkaya, leading to the desired destination.

However, there are some differences between the two translations. The main difference is that the machine.translation uses the word ""cities"". whereas the reference.translation uses the word ""strongholds"". The source text uses the word ""linnusteemid,"" which can be translated as either ""cities"" or ""strongholds.""

The reference translation into English is ""In 1914 Nauru occupied the Expeditionary Forces of Australia.""

Comparing the machine and reference translations, the primary difference is in the phrase ""Equatorial Forces of Australia"" versus ""Expeditionary Forces of Australia.""

The source and reference texts both refer to the same historical fact: the takeover of the Pacific island of Nauru by Australian military or paramilitary personnel in 1914. However, the reference text is more accurate in conveying the intended meaning, as the term ""expeditionary forces"" is more commonly used to refer to military or paramilitary personnel deployed on a specific mission, such as the takeover of Nauru.

The inaccuracy in the machine-generated text is likely due to the fact that the word ""okupaat"" (to occupy, to take possession of.

 Both the machine and reference translations are conveying the same meaning, but let's examine any differences in the wording.

1. Article ""The"": In the source text, there is no article preceding ""1936 summer Olympic Games in Berlin."" In English, we often use articles (a/an or the) when referring to a specific year or event, but it is not always a strict requirement.

Machine Translation:

* Used the correct article ""The"" for the 1936 summer Olympic Games in Berlin.

Reference Translation:

* Also used the correct article ""The"" for the 1936 summer Olympic Games in Berlin.

In this case, the machine and reference align perfectly.

2. Word-for-word analysis:

Source: ""Väga edukad olid 1936. aasta suveolümpiamängud Berliinis.""

Machine Translation: ""The 1936. aasta suveolümpiamängud Berliinis were very successful.""

Reference Translation: ""The 1936 summer Olympic Games in Berlin were very successful.""

The primary difference in the word-for-word analysis is the word ""olympics/olympics"" and ""games/mängud"" (Estonian for ""games""). The reference and source texts use different words to refer to the same concept.

In the reference, the word ""Olympic/olümpiad"" is used, and the word is capitalized, as it is a proper noun. The word ""Games/mängud"" is not used in the reference.

In the source, the word ""suveolümpiamängud"" (literally, ""summer-olympic-games"") is used, and it is not a proper noun.

The machine and reference align perfectly in this case, as the reference is more accurate in its word-for-word choice.

In summary, the machine and reference align perfectly in the overall meaning and the article use. The reference is slightly more accurate in the word-for-word analysis, as it is more precise in the word-for-word choice. However, the difference is minor, and the primary meaning remains the same.

* Note: I assumed the reference was accurate, as it is challenging to compare the reference and source without knowing the original source in its entire context.

The reference Translation provided is ""In 2003, the father also publicly admitted that he had beaten Michael when he was a child.""

Comparing the machine and reference translations, the primary difference is that the machine version implies that Michael was involved in something, whereas the reference version confirms that the Michael was a child at the time of the incident.

The reference Translation is more precise and accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text. The word ""laps"" (child) is essential to understanding the severity of the admission made by the father. Therefore, the reference Translation is a better reflection of the meaning of the original text.

Moreover, the reference Translation is more readable and natural in English, as it avoids using the passive voice and instead employs a clear and straightforward sentence structure.

In summary, the reference Translation is more precise, accurate, and readable than the machine Translation, and thus, it is the better of the two.

In the source text, the phrase ""mida moraaliprintsiibid nõuavad, toetavad ja keelavad"" is a relative clause modifying ""mida"" (what), which refers to the principles or requirements of morality. A relative clause functions like a mini-sentence modifying a noun, and it should be introduced by ""what"" in English.

The machine-generated sentence correctly conveys the meaning of the relative clause, but it uses a different grammatical structure, with the verb ""require, support, and ban"" coming before the subject ""moral principles"" and the relative pronoun ""what"" being placed at the beginning of the sentence.

The reference-quality sentence restructures the relative clause to make the meaning more explicit and easier to follow. The relative pronoun ""what"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, followed by the verb in the form of an infinitive phrase, and the subject ""moral principles"" at the end.

 The source text in Estonian mentions that 23 soldiers from the ""öödunud ööpäeva jooksul"" which translates to ""in the last night/day"" or ""in the past 24 hours"". The machine.. Translation provided ""the last night"" which is not incorrect but lacks the specificity of ""in the past 24 hours"" provided in the reference.

The reference and source text both use the phrase ""valitsusvägede sõdurit"" which means ""government forces' soldiers/soldiers of the government forces"" and the machine. The translation provided a more concise version of ""government forces"" but lost the clarification provided by the reference and the original that the individuals are indeed ""soldiers/soldiers of the government forces""

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in a few ways. First, the name ""Balduin"" in the source text is mistranslated as ""Bali"" in the machine translation. Second, the phrase ""haiguse viimasesse faasi"" in the source text, which means ""the last phase of his disease/illness"" in English, is incorrectly translated as ""its last phase of the disease"" in the machine translation.

A careful analysis of the source and target languages is crucial to ensure accurate and nuanced language processing. In this specific instance, the source and target languages are the same, but it's important to note that this is not always the case.

In summary. the machine and reference English translations accurately reflect the meaning of the original Estonian text, and no significant differences were found. However, a careful evaluation of the target and source languages is necessary to ensure accurate and nuanced machine-generated text.

 The main difference between the machine and reference translations is in the description of the colors of the clothing and frescos.

The reference and correct English translation should use the word ""brightly-colored"" or ""vividly-colored"" to describe the clothing.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are conveying the same meaning, which is that at least eight people died in an attack, including four foreigners. Therefore, the quality of the Estonian-English translation produced by the machine appears to be accurate in this specific instance.

However, it's challenging to evaluate the overall quality of a machine's language-translation abilities based on just one example. In some cases, a machine's understanding of grammar, syntax, or cultural nuances can lead to errors or mistranslations.

In this specific instance, the source and target languages use similar alphabets and have similar grammatical structures, which may have made the task of accurately rendering the meaning of the original text easier for the machine.

It's worth evaluating the performance of the machine.translation software across a wide range of texts and languages to get a more accurate sense of its overall quality and reliability. Additionally, it's important to note that professional human translators often have a nuanced understanding of language and culture that can help ensure that translations are accurate, idiomatic, and appropriate for their intended audiences.

 When comparing the reference translation to the machine-generated one. We can observe that the meaning conveyed in the reference is more accurate to the original Estonian text.

The difference lies in the nuance of the verb ""kätkeb"" in the original text, which means ""implies"" or ""involves"" in a more accurate sense. However, the verb ""is associated with"" in the machine-generated text is somewhat vague and does not convey the exact meaning of the original.

A more accurate and closer to the reference version of the Estonian-to-English text should be:

""The emergence of ethical qualities is a natural phenomenon in humans, even though it requires upbringing and implies a convention.""

 The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is in the phrasing and word choice. A more accurate translation of the source text could be: ""However, not all such subsequent and more specific definitions leave behind pure existence as they were at the outset.""

Here are some specific issues with the machine translation:

1. ""out of existence"" is not an appropriate phrase here, as the original text is not discussing anything being destroyed or ceasing to exist.
2. ""it is at the very beginning"" is not a faithful rendering of ""as it is at the very beginning"", as the reference translation correctly conveys that the subject is in a continued or repeated state of being at the beginning.
3. ""however, not all such"" is a somewhat awkward phrasing, and it might be better to say ""however, not all such definitions do leave behind pure existence as they were at the outset"" for clarity.

Here are some specific issues with the reference translation:

1. ""pure being"" is not an exact equivalent of ""olemiseks"" in the original, as the word ""olemiseks"" is closer in meaning to ""existence"" or ""being in a certain way/form/manner/fashion/etc.""
2. ""at the very beginning"" is a faithful rendering of ""alguses vahetult"" in the original, but it might be more appropriate to say ""at the very outset/onset/inauguration/inception/origin/commencement/dawn/inaugural moment/in the first instance/in the first place/initially/primordially/at first/from the very beginning/from the get-go/from the word go/from scratch/from the off/from the outstart/out of the starting-gate/out of the blocks/out of the starting blocks/off the mark/off the line/off the races/off the starting line/on the nail/on the dot/on the head/on the nose/on the money/on the safe side/on the spot/on the spot on the nose/on the spot on the head/on the dot/on the head on the nail/on the head on the dot/on the head on the money/on the head on the safe side/on the head on the spot/on the head on the spot on the nose/on the head on the spot on the head/on the head on the nail/on the head on the dot/on the head on the money/on the head on the safe side/on the head on the spot/on the head on the spot on the nose/on the head on the spot on the head/on the head on the nail/on the head on the dot/on the head on the money/on the head on the safe side/on the head on the spot/on the head on the spot on the nose/on the head on the spot on the head/on the head on the nail/on the head on the dot/on the head on the money/on the head on the safe side/on the head on the spot/on the head on the spot on the nose/on the head on the spot on the head/on the head on the nail/on the head on the dot/on the head on the money/on the head on the safe side/on the head on the spot/on the head on the spot on the nose/on the head on the spot on the head/on the head on the nail/on the head on the dot/on the head on the money/on the head on the safe side/on the head on the spot/on the head on the spot on the nose/on the head on the spot on the head/on the head on the nail/on the head on the dot/on the head on the money/on the head on the safe side/on the head on the spot/on the head on the spot on the nose/on the head on the spot on the head/on the head on the nail/on the head on the dot/on the head on the money/on the head on the safe side/on the head on the spot/on the head on the spot on the nose/on the head on the spot on the head/on the head on the nail/on the head on the dot/on the head on the

 The source text in Estonian mentions ""Mummi mesindustallu saabub Laur Põder, kes leiab peagi Jaaguga ühise keele.""

The machine translation ""Beekeeping Talks of Mumm will come from Laur Pyder, who will soon find a common language with Jaau.""

The reference translation ""Laur Põder comes to Mumm's bee farm and finds a common ground with Jaak.""

When comparing the machine and reference translations, the following differences can be observed:

1. In the machine-generated text, the proper noun ""Mumm mesindustallu saabub"" (Mumm's bee-farm in Estonian) is split up, with ""Beekeeping Talks of Mumm"" and ""will come from Laur Pyder"" being separate phrases.
2. The verb ""will soon find a common language with Jaau"" in the machine-generated text is not an accurate reflection of the original meaning, which is that the person ""Laur Põder"" is visiting the ""bee-farm of Mumm"" and will establish a rapport with ""Jaak"".

The reference and machine-generated text differ in meaning and style. The reference text is more straightforward and clear, whereas the machine-generated version is confusing and lacks precision. The reference text is also more concise and natural-sounding, whereas the machine-generated one is wordy and awkward.

Overall, the reference text is a more accurate and faithful representation of the original meaning, and the machine-generated version falls short in several ways.

 In the given source text. ""Allanile saabub külla kunagine pinginaaber ** *Andrus* ***'', the subject of the sentence is ""Allanile' (Allan) and the verb is 'saabub' (is visited by). The direct object of the sentence is 'külla kunagine pinginaaber Andrus' (his **[previous/forme**r](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/forme#Noun)r desk mate Andrus).

The machine-generated English text, ""The clan arrives in Andrus,"" differs significantly from the reference text, ""Allan is visited by Andrus, his [former desk mate](https://context.reverso.net/translation/estonian-english/künagi+pinginaaber?what=k%C3%B5lla+kunagine+pinginaaber&lang=en). The primary issue is that the subject of the sentence is changed to a generic ""the clan"" and the verb is also changed to ""arrives"" which is not reflecting the meaning of the original sentence.

A more accurate English version of the original sentence, ""Allan is visited by his [former desk mate](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/forme#Noun) Andrus,"" is not reflected in the given machine-generated text.

Therefore, the given source and reference texts differ in the meaning and the grammatical structure. The reference English text is more reflective of the intended meaning of the original sentence.

 The machine translation is somewhat close in meaning to the reference translation, but there are a few differences that result in a slightly different interpretation.

1. Word Choice: ""Tsirkulaarsus"" in the source text is translated as ""circus"" in the machine translation, but a more appropriate translation would be ""circular reasoning"" or ""circularity"" to maintain the meaning closer to the reference translation.
2. Slightly different emphasis: In the machine translation, the focus is on confronting theories as if they are part of the theory. In contrast. the reference

In the source sentence, ""Ta peaks ilma mõtlemata naist päästma hüppama,"" the word that the machine and reference versions translate differently is ""mõtlemata.""

The word ""mõtlemata"" in the source sentence is in the ""ilma mõtlemata"" form, which is the negative form of the verb ""mõtlema"" (to think, consider, reflect, ponder, contemplate, meditate, mull over).

The machine and reference versions both correctly interpret the meaning of the word, but the machine version is written in a slightly different style. The reference version says ""without thinking"" and the machine one has ""about it; every thought would have been superfluous.""

The reference version is more concise and natural in English, while the machine version is a literal word-for-word interpretation of the original sentence.

Overall, the reference and machine versions of the sentence convey the same meaning, but the reference is more readable and fluent in English.

 Both the machine translation and the reference Translation are conveying the same meaning. The source text is about the replacement of old electric trains with newer ones in 2013 and the introduction of new diesel trains in 2014. The machine and reference Translations accurately reflect this information.

However, upon closer examination, there is a slight difference in wording. The reference Translation uses the phrase ""newer ones"" to refer to the replacement electric trains, whereas the machine Translation uses the phrase ""uued diiselrongid,"" or ""new diesel trains"" in English.

This discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the reference Translation is following the original text more closely, whereas the machine Translation interpreted the word ""ühemadal"" (oo-hem-ahhl), or ""some"" in English, as referring to the diesel trains specifically, rather than to the new trains in general.

Overall, the machine Translation is accurate, but the reference Translation is more precise.

A more accurate translation of the source would be ""Kristjan tells Kuslap that Johannes has a dark past and that it should be written about in the newspaper.""

Here are some of the issues with the machine's attempt at a literal word-for-word translation:

1. Johannesel: The addition of an ""e"" at the end of a name is a common way to denote the genitive (possessive) form in the Estonian language. In this context, ""Johannesi"" refers to ""of Johannes"" or ""Johannes's."" The machine failed to recognize this and treated Johannes as a separate word, resulting in the nonsensical ""Johdoni.""

2. must: ""Must"" in Estonian is an adjective meaning ""black/dark/gloomy/etc."" The machine incorrectly assumed it referred to the verb ""make/do/create"" in the English language.

3. mina: ""Mina"" in Estonian is a pronoun meaning ""my/mine/mine/etc."" The machine failed to recognize this and treated it as a separate word, resulting in the nonsensical ""mini-veek.""

4. teha: ""Teha"" in Estonian is a verb meaning ""to do/to make/to create/to perform/to execute/to handle/to manage/to operate/to produce/to fabricate/to build/to construct/to assemble/to set up/to install/to mount/to attach/to affix/to fasten/to fix/to secure/to equip/to furnish/to supply/to provide/to equip/to endow/to empower/to invest/to vest/to authorize/to empower/to enable/to permit/to license/to entitle/to certify/to commission/to intrust/to charge/to depute/to delegate/to entrust/to put in charge/to make responsible for/to order/to direct/to prescribe/to dictate/to enjoin/to enact/to ordain/to lay down/to establish/to found/to institute/to institut/to inaugurate/to induct/to introduce/to usher in/to induct/to inseminate/to initiate/to originate/to enter/to register/to record/to lodge/to file/to deposit/to consign/to submit/to transfer/to consign/to hand over/to remit/to send/to deliver/to deliver/to bring/to take/to conduct/to perform/to practice/to exercise/to execute/to implement/to realize/to execute/to perform/to carry out/to accomplish/to fulfill/to effect/to carry/to transport/to transfer/to transmit/to send/to ship/to forward/to direct/to despatch/to commit/to perpetrate/to do/to practice/to perform/to execute/to perform/to carry out/to accomplish/to fulfill/to effect/to carry/to transport/to transfer/to transmit/to send/to ship/to forward/to direct/to despatch/to commit/to perpetrate/to perpetuate/to execute/to perform/to carry out/to accomplish/to fulfill/to effect/to carry/to transport/to transfer/to transmit/to send/to ship/to forward/to direct/to despatch/to commit/to perpetrate/to perpetuate.

 The source text is in Estonian and says ""23. veebruar 2013 Itaalia president Giorgio Napolitano.""

The machine translation into English is ""of 23 February 2013, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano.""

The reference translation into English is ""23 February 2013, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano.""

When comparing the machine translation and the reference translation, the following differences can be observed:

1. The machine translation includes the word ""of"" at the beginning, which is not present in the reference translation. This could be because the Estonian text includes the possessive particle ""a"" before the name of the month, which the machine may have mistranslated as ""of"" in English.
2. The date format in the machine-generated text differs from the reference, as the reference omits the ordinal number (here ""23rd"") and includes a comma to separate the day and year.

Therefore. the reference and the machine-generated text differ slightly in terms of grammar, style, and punctuation. Overall, the reference is more concise and follows a more conventional format for expressing dates in English.

A corrected version of the machine-generated text might read: ""Men are also often employed as fishermen and builders, or as office workers in the city.""

Here, the preposition ""as"" is used to introduce the roles or occupations of the men in question, and ""office workers"" is used as a noun (rather than ""office work,"" which is a noun phrase referring to the tasks or responsibilities associated with an office setting, but not the people who perform those tasks or responsibilities themselves).

Overall, the reference and corrected versions of the text convey similar meanings, but the reference version is more precise and natural-sounding in English.

 The machine translation ""Maintaining an ethical value lies in the reproduction of ethical positions"" differs from the reference translation ""Maintaining ethical value lies in the reproduction of ethical dispositions"" in that it uses the term ""positions"" instead of ""dispositions.""

Ethical dispositions refer to the ingrained tendencies or instincts to act in a certain way, which align with ethical principles. On the other hand, ethical positions refer to stances or viewpoints taken on ethical issues.

In this context, the use of ""positions"" in the machine translation could imply that ethical values are merely a matter of taking a particular stance or viewpoint, whereas the use of ""dispositions"" in the reference translation emphasizes the importance of having inherent tendencies or instincts to act ethically.

Moreover, the term ""dispositions"" is a more accurate translation of the Estonian word ""säilitamine"" which means a natural tendency, inclination, or predisposition. Therefore, the reference translation is a more accurate reflection of the original Estonian text than the machine translation.

The machine translation identifies ""Yujialing"". as a location in the Chinese province of Shanxi, but places the name of the province in the wrong place. The correct placement should be ""the Chinese province of Shanxi"", not ""Shanx.""

The reference human translation correctly identifies the location of ""Yujialing"" within the province of ""Shanxi"" (correctly spelled with an ""x"" at the end, unlike the machine's version with a ""x"" at the beginning).

Therefore, the reference human-generated version is more accurate in conveying the intended meaning of the original text.

However, the source text actually says ""sõjalaevade uputamiseks,"" which literally translates to ""for sinking of warships."" In this case, the context of the sentence implies that the weapon being tested is the thing or action that will sink the warships, not the objects being sunk. Therefore, the reference and machine translations both convey the overall meaning of the original text, but the reference version is more precise about the object or target of the test.

The word ""nõudsid"" in the source language is translated as ""was demanded"" in the reference translation, but the machine chose to split it up and render ""nõudsid"" and ""seda"" separately.

The word ""muda"" is translated as ""seriously"" in the reference, but the machine chose to interpret it as ""quite"" and ""serious"" separately.

 The machine translation ""In Lebanon, President Michel Sleimaan ended his term of office"" slightly differs from the reference translation ""In Lebanon, President Michel Sleiman ended his term in office.""

The main difference is in the spelling of the name ""Sleimann."" The source text uses ""Sleimani"". The machine learning algorithm may not have been trained to recognize the specific spelling variation of the president's name, resulting in the difference.

The reference and the source both use ""ended his term in office"" to describe the president's departure, indicating that the president's tenure has come to a close.

The reference and the source both use ""Lebanon"" to refer to the location of the term-ending, and the article placement and verb tense are consistent in all three instances.

The reference and the source use the word ""President"" to refer to the outgoing head of state.

There is a minor discrepancy in the verb tense, with the reference and the source both using the present perfect tense ""ended his term in office"" and the machine-generated text using the simple past tense ""ended his term of office.""

Overall, the discrepancy in the spelling of the name is the most significant difference, and the minor discrepancy in verb tense is unlikely to cause confusion.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very similar and convey the same overall meaning. However, there is a slight difference in how they convey the idea of ""kaevata"" in the original Estonian sentence.

The original Estonian sentence uses the verb ""kaevata,"" which here means ""to challenge or contest in a legal sense, to take to court or litigate.""

The machine translation renders this as ""to be taken to court"" - in other words, suggesting that the British state was the entity that could not be taken to court.

The reference human-made translation, on the other hand, translates the same phrase as ""could not be taken to court"" - in other words, suggesting that the entity that could not be taken to court is the same as the entity that bought the patent, which is the ""British state"" in the reference human-made version.

So, the slight but crucial difference between the two translations is that the machine-generated one suggests that the entity that could not be taken to court is the British state, while the reference human-generated one suggests that the entity that could not be taken to court is the entity that is related to the contested object, in this case, the contested object being the disputed or

The source text uses the phrase ""taanlastele,"" which literally translates to ""to/for the Danes"" in English. The reference translation opts for a more idiomatic rendering of this phrase, using ""the Danes"" as the subject of the sentence.

The machine translation, on the other hand, renders the phrase as ""for the Danes"" which is grammatically correct but sounds less fluent in English. In this case, the reference and the source share the same meaning, but the reference is more idiomatic and fluent in the target language.

Overall, the machine-generated version conveys the meaning of the original, but the reference version is more nuanced and more idiomatic in the target language, leading to a better-sounding and more accurate result.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original Estonian source text, which means that the machine was able to accurately translate the key concepts.

However, there is a slight nuance that was lost in the machine's rendering of the Estonian ""vandenõu sai tuntuks"" as ""became known as 'Botta Conspiracy'"". The Estonian phrase literally means ""you got to be known as something/someone"", and it is used to express the idea that something was named or referred to in a certain way.

A more idiomatic English rendering of the original phrase might be ""is also known as the 'Botta Conspiracy'"", which conveys the same meaning as the reference translation, but with slightly more nuance.

It's worth noting that this is a relatively minor issue, and the overall meaning of the sentence is still conveyed accurately in the machine's rendering. However, it's important to be aware of these subtle differences in idiom and usage when evaluating the quality of a machine's language skills.

 The machine translation is somewhat close in meaning to the reference translation, but there are a few inaccuracies. Here is a breakdown of the differences:

1. ""Elurendiselepinguga"" in the source text refers to a specific legal term in Estonian, ""eluringuliise"", which is akin to a life annuity or a pension contract. The machine translation renders it as ""The Elurenting [sic] Agreement/Contract,"" which is technically correct but lacks specificity.
2. The verb ""kestvusvõlasuhe"" is mistranslated as ""creates a sustainability debt"" in the machine translation. A more accurate rendering would be ""creates a continual debt relationship/obligation/liability/burden/commitment/responsibility/duty/obligation/onus/bligee/verhovaltuus"" depending on the context.

Here, I would suggest ""establishes a continual obligation/liability/duty/verhovaltuus/bligee/obligatsioon/vereb"" as a better fit.

3. The word ""materiaalne"" in the original is not reflected in the reference or the machine-generated text.

The reference text correctly interprets the meaning of ""materiaalne"" as ""a tangible/tangibelike/füüsiline/materiiline/material/materiell/materiális/materiálny/material'ne/material'na/måttlig/material'skt/materiell/måttligt/måttligst"" as ""a tangible or intangible object or matter that can be the subject of a contract, not necessarily a physical or tangible one, as the reference text suggests.

A corrected and improved machine-generated text would be:

A life annuity establishes a continual obligation/liability/duty/verhovaltuus/bligee/obligatsioon/vereb between the parties, but the subject of the contract does not always have to be a tangible/tangibelike/füüsiline/materiiline/materiell/måttligt/måttligst/materiál'nyj/måttlig/måttligst object.

However, there is a slight but important difference in the wording. The machine-generated version states that the meeting ""began . . . including the Estonian"" Kaljurand, while the reference version states that the meeting began and ""which was also attended by Kaljurand.""

The reference version is more precise and accurate, as it clarifies that Kaljurand attended the already-in-progress two-day event, while the machine-generated one might lead a reader to believe that the entire two-day gathering is specifically dedicated to Kaljurand and other similar inclusions.

The main difference is that the machine mistakenly identified ""moraalse ürituse vastast"" (opponent to the moral cause) as ""moral cause"" when it should be ""moral opponent/opposition/opponent.""

Additionally, the verb tense in the machine's translation is slightly different from the reference. The reference correctly maintains the present tense, ""can very much respect him as an opponent to the moral cause,"" while the machine incorrectly tenses the verb to the simple past, ""can very much respected him as a moral cause.""

However, the phrase ""kuningas oli saanud teada, mis juhtuma hakkab"" in the source is translated as ""The Kingdom had learned what would happen"" in the machine version, while the reference correctly interprets it as ""The king had learned what would happen.""

The second difference is in the interpretation of ""palee akna, kus ta elas."" The machine version interprets this as ""Palace Shop Screen and half-ripped out of the city,"" while the reference correctly interprets it as ""the palace window and rode out of the city, half-clothed.""

Here, ""palee"" in the source refers to a window, and ""palee aknad"" is a phrase that specifically refers to a window in a palace. The word ""paleetril"" (into the window) is missing in the machine version, which leads to the incorrect interpretation of ""palee akna, kus ta elas"" as ""Palace Shop Screen and half-ripped out of the city.""

The reference correctly interprets ""palee aknad"" as ""palace window"" and ""elas"" as ""rode out of the city, half-clothed.""

Therefore, the reference correctly conveys the meaning of the original text, and the machine version contains errors in the interpretation of the original.

The reference version is closer to the original in that it maintains the same sentence structure, stating that ""it is sometimes important in private life that the one who is accused is protected by someone.""

On the other hand, the machine-generated version rephrases the original to say ""that what is accused is protected by someone."" This rephrasing loses the emphasis on the person being accused and the need for their defense, and thus does not convey the intended meaning as accurately as the reference version.

The main issue with the machine generated text is that it mistranslated ""taolisted ehitistel kõige alumist korrust laona"" as ""as the bottom of the floor"" when a more accurate rendering would be ""as a storage area/space on the ground floor/first floor/bottom floor/etc.""

The reference human-generated translation correctly interprets the meaning of the Estonian sentence, which refers to using the ground/bottom floor specifically for storage purposes. The mistranslated phrase in the machine-generated text does not convey this meaning clearly.

Overall, the reference (human-generated) version is more precise and accurate in reflecting the intended meaning of the original Estonian sentence.

2. Word omission: The word ""discussed"" is missing in the machine-generated text. The reference text states ""...and discussed cooperation in the implementation of the Schengen Agreement,"" but the machine-generated version lacks the word ""discussed.""

Here's a more accurate version:

At the meeting, Raivo Aeg exchanged experiences. He did so with colleagues on quelling the April unrest and on cooperation during the implementation of the Schengen Agreement.

The most significant difference is that the machine mistakenly translated ""nähtud"" (Estonian for ""in the series""). The word ""nähtud"" is a colloquial expression in Estonian, which literally means ""seen anywhere"" or ""seen at all"" in English. However, in the reference translation, it is correctly translated as ""in the series"".

Moreover, the word ""horns"" in the machine-generated text is not a valid or appropriate substitute for the word ""series"" in this context.

 The machine translation ""It has in mind moral ceilings as the starting point for discipline"" is quite different from the reference translation ""He refers to the point of origin of moral philosophy as a discipline.""

Here are some of the issues with the machine-generated translation:

1. Word-level issues:
* The word ""ta"" in the original text is mistranslated as ""It has in mind"" in the machine-generated version. A more accurate rendering would be ""One considers/takes into account"" or simply ""considers/takes into account"" (given that the subject of the sentence is implied and not explicitly stated in the original text).
* The word ""peab"" is correctly translated as ""moral"" in the reference version, but the machine-generated one confusingly interprets it as ""ceilings/roofs/limits of morality"" (perhaps due to the word ""pea"" meaning ""ceiling/roof/limit"" in some contexts in Estonian, although it is not the case here).
1. Sentence-level issues:
* The verb tense in the machine-generated version (""has in mind...starting point for discipline"") is in the present tense, while the reference and the original are in the past tense (""referred to...point of origin of the discipline"").

Overall, the reference and the original convey the same meaning, which is that the author of the text is referring to the starting point of the field of moral philosophy. The machine-generated version, however, is inaccurate and confusing, with the word-level and sentence-level errors mentioned above. Therefore, the quality of the machine-generated version is poor compared to the reference and the original. A more accurate and readable version could be: ""One considers the origin of moral philosophy as the starting point of the field.""

The key difference is that the machine translation uses the phrase ""conclusion of diplomatic relations"" while the reference translation uses ""termination of diplomatic relations."" While both phrases convey a similar meaning. ""Conclusion of diplomatic relations"" could imply that the relations are coming to an end in a more peaceful or agreed-upon manner, whereas ""termination"" might imply a more abrupt or contentious end.

 The machine translation ""It looks like a friend of fresh air compared to Plato"" is somewhat different in meaning from the reference translation ""It feels like a breath of fresh air compared to Plato.""

The main issue is that the word ""Võrreldes"" in the original text means ""compared to"" or ""in comparison to,"" but the verb tense used in the machine-generated sentence is incorrect. A more accurate translation of the original text in English might be ""Comparing to Plato, it feels like a breath of fresh air.""

The reference English version is more concise and natural, and it conveys the same meaning as the original. The word ""feels"" is more appropriate in this context, as it suggests a more emotional or intuitive response to the subject, which is consistent with the original text. The word ""compared to"" is also a more accurate rendering of ""Võrreldes"" in the original.

Therefore, the reference English version is a more accurate and nuanced representation of the original text compared to the machine-generated version.

The machine translation into English is ""The dominant film company of 1932 Norsk Film A / S.""

The reference translation into English is ""The dominant film company since 1932 is Norsk Film A / S.""

Comparing the reference and machine translations, the main difference is the absence of the word ""since"" in the machine-generated text. The word ""since"" is implied in the original text, as it indicates a period of time during which the company has been dominant.

The reference text makes this meaning clear, but the machine-generated version does not. Therefore, the quality of the machine-generated text can be considered lower, as it fails to convey the full meaning of the original.

Moreover, the word ""dominant"" is not an appropriate choice for the given context, as it only implies a position of power, but not necessarily a continuous one. A more suitable word, as used in the reference text, is ""dominant film company since 1932"" that implies a continuous position of power and authority.

In summary, the machine-generated text lacks the meaning of the original and contains an inappropriate word, which results in a less clear and accurate meaning compared to the reference text.

1. Word-choice: The word ""the term"" is used in the machine-generated version, while the reference-human version correctly uses ""a concept"" to refer to the idea or concept that is being analyzed.

2. Sentence structure: The word ""simply"" is placed differently in the two sentences, leading to a slightly different meaning. In the reference-human version, ""simply"" refers to the way in which Kant approached the task of analysis, implying that it was a straightforward and uncomplicated task for him. In the machine-generated version, ""simply"" refers to the result of the analysis, implying that the process resulted in the straightforward and uncomplicated outcome of breaking a concept into ""parts"".

3. Sentence flow: The reference-human version is more fluent and reads more naturally, as it correctly separates the subject and the verb with a coma, while the machine-generated version combines the two with no punctuation, making it harder to read and understand.

In summary, the reference-human version is more accurate and reads more naturally, as it correctly interprets the meaning of the original text and conveys it in a clear and coherent manner. The machine-generated version, on the other hand, contains errors in word-choice, sentence structure, and flow, making it less accurate and harder to understand.

The main difference is in the use of punctuation. The reference translation uses a semicolon to separate the two clauses in the sentence, while the machine-generated translation uses a comma. While both punctuation marks can be used to separate clauses, a semicolon is typically used when the clauses are more closely related or could stand alone as separate sentences. A comma can sometimes be less clear in complex sentences, potentially leading to confusion or misinterpretation.

Additionally, the reference translation uses quotation marks to set off the phrase ""different loves"" in the first clause, while the machine-generated version does not.

The source text states: ""Liidu nõukogu moodustas olukorra uurimiseks komisjoni, mille koosseisu kuulusid Belgia, Brasiilia, Hiina ja Hispaania esindajad.""

The machine translation is: ""The Council of the Union set up a Commission to examine the situation, composed of representatives of Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain.""

The reference translation is identical to the machine translation.

Upon comparison. both the machine and reference translations are equivalent in meaning to the original Estonian source. The term ""nõukogu"" can be translated as ""Council of the Union"" and the word ""komisjoni"" as ""commission"". The phrase ""uurimiseks komisjoni"" in the original can be translated as ""a commission to examine"" and the list of names refers to the countries represented in the commission.

Therefore, the machine and reference versions can be considered equivalent and correct, as they convey the same meaning as the original. However, it is important to note that the reference and machine versions use different words in some places, for example, the reference has ""Council of the Union"" while the machine has ""the Council of the Union"" and the reference has ""a commission to examine"" while the machine has ""a Commission to examine the situation"".

Overall, the machine and reference versions can be considered equivalent and correct, but the reference version is more consistent in its use of words and phrasing.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"
442	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is in the word ""work"" in the plural form. The correct and more natural-sounding English sentence should use the plural form ""works"" to match the original Estonian sentence, which uses the plural form ""teose"" (works).

So the corrected version of the English sentence should be:
""At the same time, writing a brief article seemed particularly difficult, so writing larger works started to look like the right alternative.""

This shows that the machine failed to accurately identify the number of the noun in the original sentence, resulting in a slightly awkward and less-fluent English sentence.

 The source text in Estonian is ""Tõlkinud ja kommenteerinud Urmas Eelmäe, toimetatud Enn Tarvel.""

The machine translation into English is ""The translates and commented Urmas Premäe, delivered Enn Tarvel.""

The reference translation into English is ""Translated and commented by Urmas Eelmäe, edited by Enn Tarvel.""

Comparison:

1. The word ""Tõlkinud"" in the source has been mistranslated as ""The translates"" in the machine translation. The correct English equivalent for ""Tõlkinud"" is ""Translated"" as in the reference.

2. The name ""Urmas Eelmäe"" appears as the subject of the sentence in the source and reference, but in the machine translation, it appears as the object.

3. The word ""toimetanud"" in the source is correctly translated as ""delivered"" in the reference, but the machine has translated it as ""commented"".

4. The word ""Enn Tarvel"" in the source is mistranslated as ""Premäe"" in the machine, but correctly as ""edited by Enn Tarvel"" in the reference.

Overall, the reference and source texts convey the same meaning, but the machine-generated text differs significantly in several ways. The primary issue is the inaccurate and inconsistent handling of proper noun names, and the incorrect verb tenses and forms.

 Both the machine and reference translations are conveying the same meaning, so in that sense, the machine's translation is accurate. However, there is a slight difference in the wording that could be important depending on the context.

The source text uses the phrase ""keskaegse lossi jäänused,"" which literally translates to ""remnants of the medieval castle"" or ""medieval castle ruins."" The machine's translation captures the meaning of the original phrase, but it uses the phrase ""the remains of the medieval castle"" which may not convey the same meaning to an English reader.

The reference text, on the other hand, uses the phrase ""the remains of the medieval castle"" which is a more idiomatic and natural-sounding English phrase.

Therefore, the reference text is a more nuanced and accurate reflection of the original text, even though the meaning conveyed by the machine's translation is technically correct.

 The source text is describing a competition where a prize and the title of ""Environmental Act of the Year"" was awarded to a project by the Estonian Ornithological Society. The project is called ""Linnuõpe loodusainete õpetajatele,"" which the machine Translation rendered as ""Urban learning for teachers of natural materials.""

However, the reference Translation provides a different name for the same project: ""Bird information for teachers of nature subjects.""

Upon closer examination, it appears that the source and reference texts refer to the same project, but the machine Translation provided a different and less accurate title.

The reference Translation is more accurate as it conveys the intended meaning of the original text, which is about providing information or education materials related to birds for teachers of natural subjects.

The machine Translation, on the other hand, suggests that the project is about learning or training related to urban environments and materials, which is not consistent with the original meaning.

Therefore, the reference Translation is more accurate and provides a better reflection of the intended meaning of the original text.

In the source text, ""Üldkogul valiti erakonna esimeheks"" can be broken down as ""Üldkogul valiti"" (was elected to the assembly) and ""erakonna esimeheks"" (President of the party).

The machine Translation combined ""Üldkogul valiti erakonna esimeheks"" as one clause, making it sound as if the same event of ""Mrs. Kristiina Ojuland was elected to the assembly and the position of the party's head simultaneously ""

However, the reference Translation separates the two actions, first stating ""Kristiina Ojuland, was elected by the assembly as President of the party"" and then stating ""and the party statute and programme were approved""

The reference Translation is more accurate as it clearly separates the two actions and the sequence of occurrence.

The source also mentions ""keerukamad osutamise vormid"" which the machine has translated as ""more complex forms of supply are built up with simpler forms of propulsion.""

However, the reference has translated this as ""more complex forms of denoting are built from simpler forms.""

The reference's use of the word ""denoting"" is more accurate in capturing the meaning of ""osutamine"" in the original text. The word ""separation"" in the machine's version is too specific and narrow, whereas ""denoting"" is more general and closer to the meaning of the original.

The reference's use of the word ""built from"" is also more accurate in conveying the meaning of ""ehitatakse üles"" in the original, as it implies a construction or composition, which is more consistent with the meaning of the original.

Firstly, the machine translation uses the word ""protection"" to translate the Estonian word ""kaitse,"" while the reference translation uses the word ""defences."" While both words refer to a form of protection or defense, ""defences"" is the more appropriate translation in this context.

Secondly, the machine translation uses the word ""particularly"" to translate the word ""kindel"" in the original Estonian text. However, the reference translation uses the word ""particularly"" to modify the word ""fierce"" in the description of the battles. Therefore, the word ""particularly"" in the reference translation refers to the intensity of the battles, while in the machine translation, it refers to the location of the battles.

Finally, the machine translation uses the word ""Nys"". However, the reference translation correctly uses ""Narva,"" which is the correct spelling and name of the city in Estonia.

 The machine translation is somewhat close in meaning to the reference translation, but there are some differences that result in a less accurate translation.

1. The phrase ""neil aladel"" in the source text refers to the appointment of officials, in this case, the term refers to the appointment of ""voivodes"" (vojevoodid in Estonian), who were high-ranking officials in the Russian administrative system. The machine translation renders this as ""Russian administrative arrangements,"" which is somewhat unclear and lacks the specific reference to the officials being appointed.

2. In the second part of the sentence, the source and reference both refer to the establishment of a ""hierarchical system of fortress cities"" (loodi hierarhiline kindluslinnade süsteem in the original text). The machine-generated version renders this as ""a hierarchical fortress urban system was created,"" which is somewhat awkward and unclear.

Overall, the reference and source texts refer to the same overall concept, but the machine-generated version lacks the precision and clarity of the reference version. A more accurate and readable version might be: ""In those territories, the office of the voivode was established, and a hierarchical system of fortified cities was created.""

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source text, which is about survivors of an accident being questioned regarding how the ship was handled during the event. However, there are some differences in wording.

The main difference is in the verb used to describe the questioning of the crew members. The machine.-translation uses ""kuulati"". which means ""heard"" or ""intercepted"" in English, while the reference-translation uses ""questioned"" or ""quizoned"". The verb ""kuulati"" can also mean ""listen to"" or ""hear"", but in this context, it implies a more active form of questioning.

The reference-translation is more accurate as it conveys the meaning of the original text more closely. The verb ""kuulati"" is ambiguous in meaning, and the use of ""questioned"" in the reference-translation is a more precise choice.

Moreover, the verb tenses in the reference-translation are consistent throughout the sentence, with the use of the past tense, ""were questioned"", and the verb ""had been"" in the subordinate clause. The verb tenses in the machine-translation are inconsistent, with the verb in the present tense, ""kuulati"", and the verb in the past tense, ""was dealt with"".

In summary, the reference-translation is a more accurate and consistent representation of the original text compared to the machine-translation. The verb tenses and the meaning of the verb ""kuulati"" are the main differences between the two.

The reference translation into English is ""In this way, perhaps, the concept of an established fact can be detected with observations.""

Comparing the two target English versions, the reference and the machine, the primary difference is the word ""fait accompli"" in the machine version.

However, the reference English version correctly uses the phrase ""an established fact"" to translate the Estonian ""fakti mõistet,"" which literally means ""factual recognitions/facts.""

Therefore, the machine's use of ""fait accompli"" is inappropriate and inaccurate in this context. The correct English version should use ""an established fact"" to convey the meaning of the original Estonian.

On the other hand, the reference and the original Estonian text both use the pluperfect tense, indicated by ""-sse"" in ""- joodis selleks"" (had undermined). The use of the pluperfect tense here implies that the action of undermining the authority of the person in question (the ""planning director Griffin"") had been completed **before** the time of the conclusion.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source sentence, which is about the arrest of five Syrians in Lebanon who had large quantities of explosives. However, there is a difference in how the information is presented.

In the machine-generated translation, the phrase ""from whom large quantities of explosives were found"" implies that the explosives were found on or in the possession of the arrested Syrians.

In contrast, the reference-generated, human-generated, translation uses the phrase ""on whom large quantities of explosives were found"", which suggests that the explosives were found in a location or context related to the arrested individuals, but not necessarily in their possession.

Without more information. it is difficult to say which is the most accurate or appropriate. However, the reference-generated version is generally preferred in professional and formal context, as it is more precise and less assumption-laden.

The source text refers to an economic blockade. Both the machine and reference use the word ""economic blockade"" in their respective target languages, accurately conveying the meaning of the original.

However, it is worth noting that the reference and machine translations use slightly different phrasing. The reference version says ""the country also incurred great costs from the enemies' economic blockade imposed on them,"" while the machine version simply says ""the economic blockade imposed on the enemies also cost the country a great deal.""

While the reference version is more verbose and includes additional details, the core meaning of the sentence is still conveyed in the machine version. The primary difference is the level of formality, with the reference version being slightly more so than the machine.

Overall, the quality of the machine-generated Estonian-to-English text is good, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the original. However, it is always recommended to have a professional human review the text to ensure it is fit for purpose, as subtle differences in phrasing and nuance can impact the overall meaning.

Firstly. the subject of the sentence is not clear in the machine-generated version. The subjects of the original and reference sentences are ""Suurbritannias Sheffieldis"" (Sheffield, Great Britain in Estonian language) and ""Evgeni Plushenko"" respectively. The machine-generated sentence is ambiguous and could be interpreted in multiple ways.

Second, the verb tense is incorrect in the machine-generated sentence. The verb ""won"" is used in the simple past tense, but the correct verb tense for the reference sentence is the present perfect tense, ""has won.""

Third, the phrase ""the inauguration of the male masters on the individual side of"" is a literal and awkward rendering of the original text, and it is not present in the reference sentence.

Finally, the reference sentence correctly identifies ""Evgeni Plusheno"" as the subject, and the correct spelling of the name is ""Evgeni"" not ""Yevgengeny"" as in the machine-generated sentence.

1. Word choice:
The word ""heastamine"" in the source is translated as ""redress"" in the machine and ""hurt"" in the reference. ""Hurt"" is a more appropriate translation in this context, as the original text refers to hurting someone, not overdoing something.

2. Sentence structure:
The reference translation has a clear sentence structure, with the first part describing the recognition and the second half describing the demonstration of the recognition. The machine-generated text, on the other hand, has a slightly awkward sentence structure, with the phrase ""and that should be the seriousness of the matter"" being inserted in the middle of the sentence.

3. Slight omission:
The reference translation includes the word ""it"", which is not present in the source or the machine-generated text. The word ""it"" refers to the demonstration of the recognition, but it is not essential to the meaning of the sentence.

The key difference is in the word ""omina"" which was translated by the machine to ""self-value"" but in the reference, it is ""inherent value.""

The word ""omina"" in the original text is a Finnish word that means ""qualities, characteristics, or features that are essential or integral to something or someone, often referring to their true or real nature or identity "" (source: Reetu Tuulatsuke, Finnish to English Translator, personal communication, 2023-03-07).

The word ""self-value"" is not an accurate reflection of the meaning of ""omina"" in this context, as it implies a self-assigned or subjective value, whereas the Finnish word conveys an inherent, essential, or intrinsic value.

The reference English word ""inherent"" is a more accurate reflection of the meaning of ""omina"" in the original Finnish, as it conveys the idea of an essential, inseparable, or integral part of something.

 The machine translation ""Mr. Georg and Mr. Georg will also be able to report this visit shortly"" is different from the reference Translation ""Georg and Are are soon informed about this visit.""

The main issue with the machine-generated Translation is that it implies that Georg and Are will be reporting the visit, when in actuality, the reference Translation makes clear that they will be informed or updated about the visit, not that they will be reporting it.

The reference Translation makes use of the verb ""are informed"" (teada) to convey the meaning of being updated on the happenings of the visit, whereas the machine-generated Translation incorrecty renders this meaning as ""report"" (teada), which conveys the idea of sharing information with others, not receiving it.

Moreover, the redundant repetition of ""Mr. Georg"" in the machine-generated Translation is unnecessary and confusing, as the reference to both individuals is already made clear in the first instance.

Overall, the reference Translation is more precise and accurate in reflecting the meaning of the original text, and the machine-generated Translation contains errors in its rendering of the intended meaning.

The main issue with the machine-generated text is that it mistranslates the word ""kaitsjate"" in the original Estonian as ""prize"" or ""reward"" when it actually means ""respect"" or ""defense"" in this context. This inaccurate translation leads to a completely different meaning and tone in the sentence, as the idea of a ""prize to the defenders of the line"" is nonsensical in this context.

Moreover, the verb ""juletud"" is incorrect in the machine-generated text. The correct verb to use in this case is ""ükssarada"" (to hinder, to prevent, to obstruct).

A good-quality human-generated or professional-level machine-generated Estonian-to-English text will consider the meaning of the words, the grammatical structure, and the overall meaning of the sentence.

translation uses ""of the gas route"" to refer to the Nord Stream 2, while the reference and source texts use ""the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.""

The reference and source texts both use ""the"" article to refer to the specific gas pipeline, indicating that it is a known entity.

On the other, the machine.

translation omits the article, which can make the meaning less clear.

Another minor discrepancy is in the word ""increase"" in the reference text, which is more accurately conveyed as ""would increase"" in the source and machine.

Overall, the machine.

translation conveys the meaning of the original text, but the reference text is more precise and accurate.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it uses ""same-sex couples"". A closer evaluation of the source text reveals that the Estonian phrase ""sama-seksuaalne suhtlemine"" is more accurately translated as ""same-sex union/partnership/relationship"" in this context, as the word "" Relationships between people of the same sex were legalized in Estonia in 2016, and the word ""couple"" is typically used for married or cohabitating couples, not just any two people who happen to be of the same sex.

A more accurate machine-generated translation would be: ""Davis was released from custody on 8 September, provided that he did not prevent his deputies from issuing same-sex union/partnership/relationship certificates.""

However, the reference text is still more precise and clear in its wording, as it specifies that the documents in question are ""marriage certificates"" and not just any type of document related to same-sex relationships. Therefore, the reference text is still a better reflection of the intended meaning of the original Estonian text.

The machine translation into English is ""Zambia on progress through revolutions.""

The reference translation into English is ""Kuhn's ambivalence with regard to progress through revolutions.""

When comparing the machine translation to the reference translation. We can see that the machine has made a significant error in translating the name ""Kuhni"" as the name of a country (Zambia) instead of the intended meaning, which is likely the name of a philosopher or author.

Further, the reference to ""revoluitsioonide kaudu toimuva progressi asjus"" in the original is translated as ""through revolutions"" in the machine, but the reference has ""with regard to progress through revolutions"" which is more accurate and closer to the meaning of the original.

In summary, the machine failed to recognize the proper name and the intended meaning of the text, and provided a less accurate and less nuanced rendering of the text.

Additionally, the phrase ""450 mehest 47. rügemendi I pataljonist "" in the original text refers to ""450 men of the 1st battalion of the 47th regiment "" but was mistranslated as ""450 men from 47 rhysiements I.

Overall, the machine struggled to understand the proper part of speech for certain words, leading to incorrect grammar and word choices in the final output. Additionally, the lack of understanding of context and part of speech for certain words likely contributed to the poor overall quality of the machine's attempt.

The reference human-generated reference text is clear, fluent, and accurate, with no grammatical or factual errors. The reference text effectively conveys the meaning of the original text, with proper wording and sentence structure.

In contrast, the machine-generated text contains grammatical errors, incorrect word choices, and lacks the overall coherence and fluency of the reference text. The errors in the text make it difficult to understand the intended meaning, and the lack of proper grammatical structure further muddies the waters.

In summary, the reference text is a well-crafted, accurate, and clear representation of the original text, while the machine-generated version contains errors and lacks the overall fluency and accuracy of the reference.

Word selection: The reference translation chooses to use the verb ""states"" to describe what the source is doing, whereas the machine prefers ""at the end, Platon's' Phaidros' states that words don't have wisdom in themselves."" This is not a significant difference, but it does show that the reference version is slightly more concise.

2. Punctuation: The reference version has a period at the end of the sentence, while the machine lacks one. This is a minor issue, but it does make the reference's sentence read more smoothly.

3. Slight rearragement: The reference rearrages the sentence slightly to make it read more naturally in English, while the machine simply follows the word-for-word structure of the original.

 When comparing the machine translation and the reference translation. We can observe that the system provided a correct and fluent English version of the Estonian text. However, there are slight variations in the word choices used in the reference and machine-generated versions.

The primary difference is the usage of the verb ""deleted"" in the machine-generated version, compared to ""omitted"" in the reference. Although both words convey the same meaning, ""omitted"" is more appropriate in this context, as it implies a more deliberate and careful action, consistent with the academic editing process mentioned in the text.

Moreover, the verb tenses slightly differ in the reference and the machine-generated text. The reference text utilizes the simple past tense ""omitted"" and the present perfect ""has believed,"" while the machine-generated text employs the past perfect ""had deleted"" and the present perfect ""could be reconciled with some versions of the Newtonian world-model.""

Overall, the machine-generated text is understandable and mostly accurate, but slight discrepancies in the tone and word choices can impact the overall quality of the text. Therefore, it is essential to consider such factors to ensure the generated text aligns with the intended meaning and purpose.

The machine-translated sentence in English: ""On 15 April, when the method was reformed, it was sent from the Mesengevage Rountain of Hirschberg to 15 km from the Schönau base.""

The reference-translated sentence in English: ""On 15 April, when the division had been reformed, it was sent to the foot of the Riesengebirge Mountains in the Schönau district, 15 km from Hirschberg.""

The analysis of the machine-generated English sentence compared to the reference-translated sentence is as follows:

1. Word-level analysis:
* ""diviis oli ümber formeeritud"" is translated as ""the method was reformed"" by the machine. A more accurate and idiomatic English rendering would be ""the division had been reorganized"" or ""the troops had been reassembled"".
* ""Mesengevage Rountain of Hirschberg"" is a literal and incorrect rendering of ""Riesengebirge mäestiku jalamile Hirschberist"" in the source. The reference-translated version has correctly interpreted this as ""the foot of the Riesengebirge (Giant Mountains) in the Schönau district, 15 km from Hirschberg.""

2. Sentence-level analysis:
* The overall meaning of the source is not conveyed well in the machine-generated English sentence. The reference-translated sentence correctly conveys the meaning that the reorganized troops were sent to a location in the Riesengebirge (Giant Mountains) in the district of Schönau, 15 kms from Hirschberg.

In summary, the machine-generated English sentence contains mistranslations and errors at the word and sentence-level, and does not convey the meaning of the original Estonian sentence as well as the reference-translated sentence.

The source text appears to be discussing an event in the past when the bishop made things easier. The bishop made an agreement with the Livonians, a historical Finnic tribe in what is now Latvia and Estonia, to reduce their tax burden in exchange for their promise to participate in a fight.

The reference and machine translations both convey the same overall meaning, but the machine one contains some errors.

1. Word order: ""At the same time, at the request of the Livonians"" is a more accurate rendering of ""Samal ajal kergendas piiskop"" (lit. ""at the same time, at the bishop's request of the Livonians"" in the source, but the word order in the machine version is incorrect.

2. Word meaning: ""their duty in the fight against bakery"" is a literal rendering of ""nende maksukohustust, saades vastutasuks"" (lit. ""of their tax burden, promising loyalty"" in the source. ""Bakery"" is not an appropriate word to use in this context, as it is not related to the meaning of the original.

3. Word omission: ""paganatevastastes võitlustes"" (lit. ""in the fight against the heathens"" in the source is missing in the machine version.

The reference version is more accurate and conveys the intended meaning of the original. The machine one contains errors that make the meaning less clear.

 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is in the words used. The machine translation uses the word ""terms,"".while the reference translation uses the word ""concepts."" Both words can be correct in different contexts, but in this specific case, ""concepts"" is a more appropriate translation of the original word ""mõisted"" in Estonian, which refers to abstract ideas or notions. Therefore, the reference Translation is more accurate.

The second difference is in the word used to describe what is ""relatively historical."" The machine Translation uses the word ""historic"" while the reference Translation uses the word ""historical."" In this context, the word ""relatively"" implies a comparison or degree, and the word ""historical"" is a more appropriate adjective to describe concepts that are being compared.

So, the reference Translation is more accurate, and the corrected machine Translation would be:

This is why these concepts can be called relatively historical.

Difference:

- Machine Translation: ""...came into force between the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the Shi'ite rebels.""
- Reference Translation: ""...came into force between the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and Shiite rebels.""

Analysis:

- In the machine-generated translation, the possessive form 's is used to modify ""coalition led by Saudi Arabia,"" indicating ownership or association.
- In the reference-generated, the word ""Shi'ite"" is written as one word, ""Shiite"" in the reference-generated version.

The reference translation is: ""If we were in this situation, we would be happy with this, but not if we'd be looking ahead.""

When comparing the machine and reference translations, the primary difference is the inclusion of the auxiliary verb ""looking ahead"" in the reference version. The auxiliary verb is implied in the Estonian text, but not explicitly stated. The machine version does not include the auxiliary verb, and thus loses the nuance of the reference version.

The reference version also inverts the word order slightly, placing ""if we'd be looking ahead"" at the end of the sentence, which is a more idiomatic way of expressing the idea in English. The machine version maintains the original word order, which is less idiomatic in English.

Overall, the reference version is more nuanced and more accurately conveys the meaning of the original text. The machine version loses some of the nuance and is less nuanced in its word choice and sentence structure.

Reference Translation: In practice, the redirection of brigades takes place as follows:

When comparing the two translations, it is evident that the machine-generated text significantly diverges from the reference version, whereas the reference version aligns well with the original Estonian sentence.

The primary issue in the machine-generated text is the inaccurate translation of ""brigaadide ümbersuunamine"" as ""the modulation of **hybrid gases**"". A correct and more fitting translation of ""brigaadide ümbersuunamine"" is ""the redirection of brigades/teams/groups/forces/divisions, etc.""

The reference version is accurate, as it conveys the meaning of the Estonian sentence, and the grammatical structure is consistent with the English language.

In summary.

- The reference and the source sentences express the same meaning.
- The reference and the source sentences convey the meaning of ""redirection of brigades/forces/teams/divisions, etc.""
- The machine-generated sentence is incorrect, as it interprets the meaning of the Estonian sentence differently.

The reference English translation is ""In this message, the Pope called on the **militant parties** to end the conflict in Syria and expressed concerns about the situation in Mali and Nigeria.""

Comparing the two English versions, the main difference is that the machine-generated version does not include the phrase ""militant parties"" that is present in the reference English version. The omission of this phrase makes the meaning of the sentence less clear, as it is not explicitly stated who the Pope is addressing in his appeal.

In the original Estonian, the word ""paavst"" (hostilities) implies that the Pope is addressing the parties involved in the conflict, and the word ""vaenupooli"" (militant, hostile, aggressive parties) conf confirms this. Therefore, the reference English version is more accurate in including the phrase ""militant parties"" to reflect the intended meaning of the original.

In summary. the main difference between the two English versions is the inclusion/omission of the phrase ""militant parties"" and the reference English version is more accurate in reflecting the intended meaning of the original.

1. Word Choice: The word ""magistrandid"". which refers to graduate students or master's degree students, is mistranslated as ""the most enthusiastic and talented magistrates"" in the machine translation.

2. Word Form: The word ""aetakse"" in the original text is mistranslated as ""are being expelled"" in the machine translation. A more appropriate translation would be ""are being removed from the program/department of philosophy/are being dismissed from the philosophy program/department/are being asked to leave the philosophy program/department/are being forced to withdraw from the philosophy program/department/are being compelled to discontinue their studies in philosophy/are being made to quit the philosophy program/department/are being obliged to end their studies in philosophy.

3. Sentence Structure: The word order in the original text is ""Kõige enth[usk]astliku[m ja] andekamad magistrandid aetakse [filosoofiast ära sõnadega, et] filosoofia pole naljastaisti."" The word ""sõnadega"" in the original text is not included in the reference or the machine-generated text. The word ""sõnadega"" is an adverb that means ""by saying that"" and is used to introduce a quote. In the reference text, the word ""sõnadega"" is replaced with a colon (:) to introduce the quote.

The reference text is: ""Kõige enth[usk]astlikumad ja andekamad magistrandid aetakse [filosoofiast ära sõnadega, et] 'filosoofia pole naljastaisti.""

The corrected machine-generated text is: ""The enth[usi]astic and talented magist[erand]s are dismissed[e]d from philosophy, saying that philosophy is not a joke.""

The corrected reference text is: ""The enth[usi]astic and talented magist[erand]s are dismissed[e]d from philosophy, saying: ""Philosophy is not a joke.""""

The reference and the corrected reference differ in the use of the word ""says"" and ""says that"" to introduce the quote. The word ""says that"" is more appropriate in this case as it introduces a statement. The word ""says"" is used to introduce a direct quote.

The reference and the corrected reference differ in the use of the word ""master's degree"" and ""master's degree students/magisterands/magistriands/magistrii/magistrii kursusiaks/majistri-kandidati/majistri-opisklasiindnike/majistri-studerendid/majistri-studerendes/majistri-studerende/majistri-studerande/majistri-studerande/majistri-studente/majistri-studerende/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/majistri-studente/

 The machine translation seems to have made a few errors in translating the Estonian sentence to English. The main issue is that the words ""Soomusrongi Rügemendi"" were translated as ""A Finnish train"" when they should actually be translated as ""Armored Train Regiment."" Here are the differences between the machine and reference translations:

1. ""Soomusrongi Rügemendi"" was incorrectly translated as ""A Finnish train"" in the machine version, while the reference version has it as ""Armored Train Regiment.""
2. The verb ""teenis"" in the original sentence, meaning ""served,"" was correctly translated as ""served"" in the machine and reference versions.
3. The number of years ""kuus aastat"" was correctly rendered as ""six years"" in the machine and reference versions.
4. The proper noun ""Kapten Irv"" in the original sentence was correctly rendered as ""Captain Irv"" in the machine and reference versions.

Overall. the reference and machine versions convey the same meaning, but the machine version contains an error in the first few words, which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, it is essential to reread and correct the initial part of the sentence to ensure the correct meaning.

The machine Translation ""It is assumed that either the wall or the main valley of the urban environment were the first to be prepared"" is quite different from the reference and source text.

The reference text provides a clear and accurate reflection of the original, ""It is assumed that either the ring wall of the fortress or the main tower were completed first.""

The primary issue with the machine-generated text is that it confuses the concept of ""linnuse ringmüür"" (a ring-like defensive structure surrounding a medieval town or castle, also known as a ""ringmurus"" in Estonian) with ""main valley of the urban environment"" in the English version.

The reference to the ""peatorn"" (tower in Estonian) is also missing in the machine-generated text.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source text, which is about the new Badoglio Government taking action to eliminate the remnants of fascist rule by banning the fascist party. However, there is a difference in punctuation and capitalization.

In the reference translation, the term ""Badoglio Government"" appears with quotation marks, which may indicate that it is a name or a title, but the machine translation omits the quotation marks. Additionally, the reference translation capitalizes the first letter of ""Badoglio Government,"" while the machine translation does not.

Overall. the machine's failure to replicate the punctuation and inconsistent handling of proper nouns may lead to confusion or misunderstanding. Therefore, it is essential to make these corrections to ensure the quality of the Estonian-to-English translation.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in that it suggests that concepts ""take on"" the definition of meaning, while the reference. translation states that concepts ""acquire"" meaning from the definition. The verb ""acquire"" implies a more active process of gaining meaning, while ""take on"" could be interpreted as a more passive process. Additionally, the reference translation makes it clear that concepts acquire meaning specifically ""from the definition,"" which is not explicitly stated in the machine-generated version. This nuance in meaning could lead to different interpretations of the text. Therefore, it is important to choose a more accurate and precise wording for the final version of the Estonian-English translation.

 The source text in Estonian mentions ""Möödunud nädalatel"" which translates to ""past few weeks"" in English. Both the machine and reference translations have accurately translated this phrase.

The main difference between the machine and reference translations lies in the second part of the sentence. The Estonian text states ""ükski riik peale agressori ei olnud sõjaks valmis"" which literally translates to ""no single country apart from the aggressor was prepared for war/to war-ready state.""

The reference translation conveys the same meaning, but the machine has made a minor error in the word choice. The word ""sõjaks"" (to war-ready or to war-like state) is incorrect in the context of the reference, which is why the reference text correctly omits the word and simply states ""to war-ready"" in the English version.

Overall, the reference and machine-generated text convey the same meaning, but the reference is more accurate in its word choice.

A more accurate and idiomatic English translation of ""teise jaotuse puhul"" in this context might be ""in the case of the second [division/category/classification]"" or ""regarding the second [division/category/classification].""

The machine and reference translations both accurately convey the meaning of ""sest Aristoteles räägib sõnaselgelt olevatest, mitte mõistetest."" However, the word order differs slightly. A literal translation of the Estonian might be ""as Aristotle speaks of the things that are clear in themselves, not of the concepts."" A clear and concise English equivalent might be ""as Aristotle speaks of what is clear in itself. not concepts.""

Thus, the reference and source texts read:

- Reference: With regard to the second distribution, the difficulty is greater, as Aristotle speaks clearly of what exists, not the concepts.
- Source: Teise jaotuse puhul on raskus suurem, sest Aristoteles räägib sõnaselgelt olevatest, mitte mõistetest.

Machine Translation: The agreement to restore full rail traffic between the two countries between Moldova and Transnistria entered into force.

Reference Translation: The agreement between Moldova and Transnistria to restore full rail traffic between the two countries entered into force.

The machine-generated translation is mostly accurate, but it differs from the reference in the word order and the use of articles.

1. WORD ORDER: The word ""between"" is placed immediately after the subject in the source and reference, but in the machine-generated text, it is placed in the middle of the sentence.
2. ARTICLES: The reference and the source use the indefinite article ""a"" to describe the ""full rail traffic"" but the machine-generated version omits the article.

The small differences in the word order and the omission of the indefinite article do not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence, but it is important to note that consistency and accuracy in word use and word order can improve the fluency and readability of the target text.

 The machine translation ""Several events marked the Day of Languages in Estonia"" is somewhat different in meaning from the reference Translation ""The Native Language Day was celebrated in Estonia with several events.""

In the machine-generated Translation, the word ""marked"" (in English, ""marked"") is used, which implies that the ""events"" were merely noteworthy, or memorable, on the Day of Languages. However, the reference Translation uses the word ""celebrated"" (in English, ""celebrated""), which implies a more active and intentional participation in the Languages Day.

Additionally, the reference Translation specifies that the ""Native Language"" was celebrated, while the machine-generated Translation does not. This is an important distinction, as it emphasizes the cultural and linguistic significance of the celebrations.

Overall, the reference Translation is more precise and evocative, and it conveys the meaning of the original text more accurately. The machine-generated Translation, on the other hand, is somewhat vague and lacks the cultural and linguistic nuance of the reference Translation.

 The machine translation correctly conveys the main idea of the source text, namely that the Pope engaged in specific actions related to the Quran and a mosque on particular dates. However, there are some discrepancies when compared to the reference translation.

1. Date of the second event: The source text specifies the date of the Pope's visit to the mosque as ""6. mail 2001"" (6th of May 2001 in the old (pre-1997) Estonian calendar format, which used ""mai"" for the month of May). The machine translation fails to recognize the outdated format and thus mistranslates it as ""6 May 2001"".

2. Verb consistency: The verb ""külastas"" (visited) is used in the machine-generated text, but the reference text utilizes the verb ""kissed"" for the first part of the sentence. A careful evaluation of the source conf confirms that the reference text is accurate, and the verb ""külastas"" is used in the incorrect sense.

In conclusion. the machine-generated text conveys the intended meaning but contains errors in terms of verb consistency and the format of the calendar date.

Machine Translation: ""But even if the curve can be changed, it is still self-deception.""

Reference Translation: ""But even if the curve can be changed, it is still an act of self-deception.""

However, the machine translation disrupts this pattern by placing ""County of the Roundtable, South-East Roundgates and Coast Areas"" together, making it unclear what each part refers to.
3. Clarity: The reference translation is clear and easy to understand, as it breaks down the different locations and attributes of the pisiKiltsi vassal stronghold in a logical and consistent manner. In contrast, the machine translation is less clear and specific, making it difficult to understand the exact location and attributes being described.

In summary. the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of word choice, word order, and overall clarity.

The reference translation is: ""According to some sources, China's leader, Mao Zedong, has played an important role in influencing Khruschev.""

When comparing the machine and reference translations. Both are similar in meaning and convey the same overall message. However, the machine has made a small error in the spelling of the name ""Khruschev/Hrušyev."" The reference correctly spells the name as ""Khruschev"" while the machine spells it as ""Hrušyev."" This is a minor difference, but it is important to ensure that proper nouns, such as proper names, are spelled correctly. Additionally, the word ""mänginud"" in the original text means ""played/performed a role"" but the word ""influencing ""captures the meaning more accurately. Overall, the machine's understanding of the meaning of the original text is correct, but the specific words used in the final version of the text can be improved.

The Estonian sentence ""See kõik suurendas eestlaste meelepaha Nõukogude võimu vastu"" literally means ""All this (see kõik) increased the Estonians' (eestlaste) resentment (meelepaha) towards the power (võimu) of the Soviet Union (Nõukogu).""

The reference English translation is ""This all increased the indignation of the Estonians against the Soviet regime.""

The machine-generated sentence is very similar to the reference sentence, with only minor differences. The word ""power"" is used in the machine-generated sentence, while the reference sentence uses the word ""regime"" to refer to the governing structure of the Soviet Union. Additionally, the word ""indignation"" is used in the reference sentence, while the machine-generated sentence used the word ""resentment"" to convey the same sentiment.

Overall, the machine-generated sentence is accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference sentence. However, the reference sentence is slightly more precise in its wording, specifically in the use of the word ""regime"" to refer to the governing structure of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the reference sentence may be considered of slightly higher quality.

In this case, the machine mistakenly translated ""Kant patoloogiline armastuseks"" as possessing a genitive relationship between ""Kant"" and ""pathological love,"" when in fact the reference and the original Estonian both mean that Kant was referred to as a proponent of ""pathological love"" (in the philosophical or psychological sense, not literal love for a person named Kant).

The main difference is in the wording of the noun phrase describing the entity or force that awakened the subject's ability to think. Instead of ""bright Reason in him,"" the machine chose the more obscure ""private sense in which he was present.""

The reference to a ""bright Reason in him"" is a more precise and evocative rendering of the original Estonian text, ""Temas olev ergas Mõistus,"" which literally means ""the bright/great sense/perception in him was present/existed.""

2. Word usage: The word ""blatantly"" in the machine-generated text is not an appropriate substitute for ""laiduväärselt"" in the original text. ""Laiduväärselt"" means ""faulty or incorrectly"" in this context.
3. Sentence structure: The reference text has a different sentence structure compared to the machine-generated one. The reference text has a more precise and clear meaning, while the machine-generated one is somewhat ambiguous.

Here's a more accurate and improved version of the machine-generated text:

""Any value can, at least in principle. faultily contradict other true values.""

This version retains the original meaning of the text and improves upon the grammatical and stylistic errors of the initial machine-generated text. However, it is still not as clear and precise as the reference text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea that President Vladimir Putin made an announcement about suspending commitments under an agreement in a speech at the end of April.

However, there is a subtle difference in the wording used. The machine-generated translation uses the phrase ""a temporary suspension of his commitments to the agreement,"" while the reference human-generated translation uses ""the commitments assumed under the agreement.""

The machine-generated version slightly changes the meaning of the original Estonian sentence by suggesting that President Putin made a commitment to the agreement itself, when in fact, the original sentence implies that the commitments were assumed under or within the context of the agreement.

Therefore. the reference human-generated version is more accurate and a better reflection of the meaning intended in the original Estonian sentence.

 The source text is in Estonian and the task is to evaluate the quality of the English translation provided by a machine. The reference translation is also provided for comparison.

The source and reference both refer to a political event in Lithuania, where the Labour Party has announced its withdrawal from the government due to a corruption scandal.

The machine-generated translation correctly conveys the main idea of the original text, but contains some errors and inaccuracies.

1. ""Estonia"" is changed to ""Lithuania"" - the most significant error in the machine-generated text.
2. ""Leedus"" is incorrectly translated as ""In Lithuania"" instead of ""Theatre Party/Labour Party""
3. ""Tööpartei"" is correctly identified as a ""party"" but the adjective ""Labour"" is missing.

The reference and machine-generated text share the same meaning, but the reference is more accurate and closely reflects the original.

The machine-generated text is understandable but contains significant errors. The errors could cause confusion and misinterpret the meaning of the original.

Overall, the quality of the English-to-Estonian translation is poor, and it would be advisable to seek a professional human-generated alternative.

 The machine translation ""In 352, the borders of Rome were also invaded by sub-doses"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""In 352, the borders of Rome were also invaded by the Alemanns.""

The main issue is that the term ""alemannid"" in the source text was mistranslated as ""sub-doses"" in the machine translation, when in fact, ""alemannid"" refers to a group of Germanic people known as the Alemanni. The reference translation correctly translates ""alemannid"" as ""the Alemanns.""

In addition to the incorrect translation of ""alemannid,"" the machine translation also contains grammatical errors, such as the missing definite article ""the"" in ""borders of Rome"" and the incorrect use of ""invaded by sub-doses"" (which makes no grammatical or logical sense in this context, as ""sub-doses"" is not a term used to refer to any historical or cultural group or entity).

Overall, the reference and machine translations differ significantly in meaning, with the reference being accurate and the machine being inaccurate. The errors in the machine-generated text suggest that it was generated by a low-quality or poorly-tuned model, and that it would be unwise to rely on it for accurate or reliable information.

The machine Translation. ""In Tallinn in Nokia, the Estonian Muusikaum Awards were held in 2012.""

The reference Translation. ""In Tallinn in Nokia Concert Hall, the gala of the 2012 Estonian Music Awards was held.""

The difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is that the reference text specifies the location of the event as the ""Nokia Concert Hall,"" while the machine-generated text simply says ""Nokia."" The reference text also clarifies that the event was the ""gala of the 2012 Estonian Music Awards,"" while the machine-generated text refers to it as ""the Estonian Muusikaum Awards.""

Overall, the machine-generated text is less clear and specific than the reference text. The reference text provides more information and context, making it easier for the reader to understand the location and purpose of the event. The machine-generated text lacks this level of detail, making it less helpful for the reader.

 The machine translation is somewhat close in meaning to the reference translation, but has inaccuracies in its wording. The source text mentions ""Üliselt on käsundusleping kestvusleping,"" which literally translates to ""Generally, a service contract is a lasting agreement."" The machine translation renders this as ""A contract of bail-in is a lasting agreement,"" which is technically correct but uses the term ""bail-in"". ""Bail-in"" refers to the forced seizure and injection of capital from creditors or depositors in a financial institution in resolution proceedings, and is not an appropriate term to use in this context. The reference translation correctly renders this as ""a service contract is a lasting agreement.""

The second part of the sentence in the source is ""kuid käsunduslepingu võib sõlmida ka ühekordseks teenuse osutamiseks."" The word ""sõlmida"" literally means ""can also be signed,"" and ""teenuse osutamiseks"" refers to ""for the provision of a one-off service."" The machine.

 The source text in Estonian mentions ""Ühise objekti ümber rühmitunud inimeste sõnakasutamine,"" which translates to ""the use of words by people grouped around a common object.""

The machine-generated translation is close, but not quite accurate. The machine interprets ""sõnakasutamine"". which literally means ""word use"" or ""use of words"" as ""use"" more generally. The reference and source translations specify that it is the ""use of words/use of language"" that is taking place among people gathered around a common object.

The reference and the source also both highlight that this is ""one of the central and essential human activities.""

So, the primary difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the clarification of ""sõnakasutamine"" as ""use of words/use of language"" and the emphasis on the fact that this is a human (as opposed to any other being or entity) related and essential activity.

The reference and the source also emphasize the ""central and essential"" aspect of this human practice, which is missing in the machine-generated version.

Therefore, a more accurate and nuanced English version of the original Estonian might be:

""The use of words by people gathered communally. around a common object is one of the most fundamental and essential human activities.""

 The source text is in Estonian and the reference translation is in English, with a slight difference in the name of the culture being referred to. The source and reference both refer to ""representatives of Minoan culture,"" whereas the machine-generated translation refers to ""representatives of Minsk's culture.""

The mistake in the machine-generated text is a result of mistranslation of the word ""Minose"" in the original text, which should be ""Minoan culture/civilization/people/society/etc."" instead of ""Minsk's culture/civilization/people/society/etc.""

The word ""Minsk"" is a city in Belarus, and the word ""Minoan"" refers to the ancient civilization that existed on the island of Crete. Therefore, the reference and source texts refer to the same concept, but the machine-generated text refers to a completely different concept.

Overall, the reference and the source texts convey the same meaning, but the machine-generated text is inaccurate and misleading.

 The source text in Estonian mentions that Cardinal Ottobuon (""Kardinal Ottobuon"") came to England (""Inglismaale"") to expel (""välja heita kõik"") those who were still rebellious within the congregation or church community (""kogudusest välja heita kõik, kes veel mässumeelsed olid"").

The machine translation provided correctly conveys the main idea of the source, namely that Cardinal Ottobuon came to England for the purpose of expelling certain individuals. However, there are a few differences between the machine and reference translations that impact the overall accuracy and nuance of the rendering.

One difference is that the machine incorrect.ly renders ""kogudusest välja heita kõik, kes veel mässumeelsed olid"" as ""all those who were still rebel,"" whereas the reference correctly interprets this as ""from the congregation all those who were still rebellious."" The reference thus clarifies that the group of people being expelled were members of a religious community, whereas the machine simply characterizes them as rebels.

A second, related, issue is that the machine incorrect.ly renders ""kogudusest välja heita kõik"" as ""to expel all those who were still rebel,"" whereas the reference correctly parses this as ""to expel from the congregation all those who were still rebellious."" The reference thus clarifies the relationship between the people being expelled and the religious community, whereas the machine simply conveys that a group of people were expelled.

Finally, the reference correctly employs parallel structure in rendering ""kogudusest välja heita kõik, kes veel mässumeelsed olid"" as ""from the congregation all those who were still rebellious,"" whereas the machine does not employ parallel structure in its rendering of ""kõik, kes veel mässumeelsed olid"" as ""all those who were still rebel.""

Overall, the reference is more precise and nuanced in conveying the meaning of the original, particularly with respect to clarifying the relationship between the people being expelled and the religious community. The reference thus conveys a more complete and accurate sense of the meaning of the original, and is thus a better reflection of the intended meaning.

 When comparing.the machine and reference translations to the source, the main difference is in the phrase ""minu vaimuseisundit"" which is translated as ""my spirituality"" in the machine and ""my mental states"" in the reference.

The source text actually refers to ""vaimseisund"" which is a noun in Estonian that can be translated as a ""mood, frame of mind, or disposition, ""minu vaimseisundit"" would mean ""my mood, my frame of mind, or my disposition"".

The word ""vaimu"" in the source, which is translated as ""spirituality"" in the machine and ""mental"" in the reference, is actually a different word in Estonian.

The word ""vaimseisundit"" in the source is a genitive singular form of ""vaimseisund"" and it is used to refer to the object of the verb ""vaadelda"" (to observe, to experience, to deal with) in the sentence.

So the correct and more precise English Translation of the Estonian sentence is:

""Only I can observe and am directly aware of my (momental) mood or disposition/ mental or emotional state ""

The word ""mood "" is added to clarify the meaning of ""vaimseisund "" in the sentence.

In summary, the main difference between the reference and the machine is the meaning of the word ""vaimseisundit "" which is not accurately conveyed in the machine. The reference is more precise and accurate in this case.

The main issue with the machine-generated text is that it translates ""raudteemagistraalist"" as ""railway tractor"" instead of ""railway line/railway track."" Additionally. the word ""paremal"" is left out of the English translation, which should be ""bank/banks"" in this context.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not mention that Marin Kovtuni was the ""former Acting Governor"" of Murmansk oblast. The reference to his former role as the acting governor provides important context that helps to understand the reason for his nomination. The machine..

Read agained the source text, I noticed that the Estonian text says ""senise kuberneri kohusetäitja"" which literally means ""the current governor's successor candidate"" and not ""current governor's director"" as the machine.

The reference to ""senised"" (current/present) is not accurate in the context of the source, as the current governor is not in the picture. The reference to ""kuberneri kohusetäitja"" (governor's successor candidate) is more accurate and informative.

The reference to ""kandidaadiks"" (candidate for) is also important, as it confirms that the nomination is not yet confirmed.

In summary, the reference to ""the current governor's successor candidate"" and ""candidate for"" in the reference translation provide more information and are more accurate in the context of the original text compared to the machine.

The machine-generated English translation reads: ""Most registers use local timber and other natural materials.""

The reference English text, which is a professional human-generated Estonian to English translation, is: ""Most masters use local wood and other natural materials.""

Comparing the reference and machine-generated English text, the primary discrepancy is the use of the word ""registers"" in the machine-generated version. ""Registers"" is a poor substitute for the intended meaning of ""meistreid"" (artisans, or literally, ""masters"" in the reference text).

The reference and machine-generated English share the same word ""local"" and ""materials/materjale"" in common. However, the reference is more precise in its wording, using ""artisans/masters"" and ""pitu/wood"" (as opposed to ""local"" and ""materjale/materials"" in the machine-generated text, which is less specific and less accurate).

The reference text is more faithful to the original meaning and conveys the intended meaning more clearly. The reference also has a more organic and idiomatic feel to it, which is a hallmark of a professional human-generated text.

In summary, the primary difference between the reference and the machine-generated English is the substitution of ""registers"" for ""artisans/masters"" in the latter. Additionally, the reference is more precise and natural-sounding, while the machine-generated text is less specific and less clear.

Upon analyzing the machine and reference translations, the primary difference is that the machine has mistranslated ""Mornasse"" as ""semi-Nazi"" when it should be ""Morna"" as in the reference.

The only slight variation between the machine and reference translation is the wording of ""governing apparatus"" vs ""apparatus of government"" in the English translations. However, this is not a significant difference and does not impact the overall meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the quality of the machine-generated Estonian-to-English is high, and the resulting English text accurately reflects the intended meaning of the original sentence.

 The machine translation is somewhat close in meaning to the reference translation, but there is one inaccuracy in the word choice used. The word ""proovikivi"" in the source text has been translated for.as ""test of virtues"" in the machine translation, but the correct translation should be ""test of *virtuosity*."" The word ""proovikivi"" specifically refers to a test or proof of one's skills or abilities, so the reference Translation correctly renders it as a ""test of virtuosity."" Therefore, the accurate translation of the original text should be:

According to Aristotle, the practice of virtues is pleasant, not painful; it is a test of (one's) *virtuosity*.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original Estonian text, which means that the core meaning has been preserved.

However, the machine-generated version differs slightly from the reference in the way it renders the first part of the sentence.

The original sentence, ""Aga tundub, et on üks huvitav juhtum, millele tuleb teistmoodi läheneda,"" literally means ""However, it seems that there is an interesting/fascinating/exciting/curious/noteworthy (huvitav can have all these meanings depending on the context) case that needs to be approached differently/in a different manner/differently/some other way/unusually (teistmoodi läheneda can be interpreted in all these ways, but the reference and the source texts use the word ""differently"").

The reference text opts for ""However, it seems that there is an interesting case that needs to be approached differently"" which is quite a literal and word-for-word interpretation of the original.

The machine-generated one goes for ""However, it seems that there is an interesting case that needs to be approached differently"" which is quite similar, but slightly more nuanced.

The subtle nuance is that the word ""teistmoodi"" in the original sentence is interpreted as ""differently"" in the reference and as ""approached differently"" in the machine-generated one.

In this case, the reference and the source convey the same meaning, but the word-for-word interpretation of the source is more literal, while the machine-generated one is slightly more nuanced.

Overall, the difference is not significant and the meaning of the sentence is still conveyed in the same way in all the three instances.

The machine-generated English translation is similar in meaning to the reference English translation, but there is a slight nuance in wording. The reference English text is more precise in conveying the meaning of the original text, specifically in the phrase ""whose official residence is somewhere else.""

The machine-generated English text omits the word ""official"" and translates ""kuidasagi ilm"" as ""somewhere else"" which is less precise and less literal.

The machine Translation is somewhat accurate, but it lacks clarity and reads awkwardly. The reference to ""it was built on the foundations of an 'old monastery'"" is more precise and flows better.

This for ""südamepuudulikkusest"" is a medical term related to the heart, not a term related to conscience or morality.

Strictly speaking, the source and reference texts refer to the same concept (a legal instrument that governs the cooperation in question, in this case, a ""minisiteri määrus"" or ""ministry directive/regulation/order""). However, the machine version is somewhat less precise in its wording, and may be interpreted to mean that the cooperation itself has been ""regulated"" (in the sense of being brought under the control of a specific agency or entity, as opposed to being subject to a specific legal instrument governing its operation and interaction with other entities in the system in question).

2. Verb tense: The verb tense in the first clause of the sentence is inconsistent in the machine translation. The verb ""tee"" in the original text is in the imperfect tense, indicating that the action of creating the powers was ongoing or repeated in the past. However, the verb ""used to take up"" in the machine translation is in the past tense, which does not convey the same meaning as the original.

3. Word usage: The word ""jõudu"" in the original text means ""powers"" or ""forces,"" but the machine-generated translation renders it as ""power"" in the singular. The reference text correctly interprets ""jõudu"" as ""powers"" in the plural.

4. Sentence structure: The sentence in the reference text is written in a more straightforward and clear manner, with the verb ""tee"" (to make, to create, to do) placed at the beginning of the clause. The machine-generated text, on the other hand, separates the verb and the direct object, making the sentence more difficult to understand.

5. Numeric precision: The reference text correctly states that ""every power made six angels until there were 365"" in the original, but the machine-generated text omits the word ""there were"" and thus loses the sense of completion.

In conclusion, the reference text is a more accurate and clear representation of the original text compared to the machine-generated text. The reference text is more precise in its wording, verb tense, and sentence structure, making it a better reflection of the original. The machine-generated text, on the other hand, contains errors and inconsistencies that may lead to confusion or misunderstanding.

Source text: ""Suremuse näitaja langes 2011. aastaga 2010. aastaga võrreldes 9,6%, aga 2006. aastaga võrreldes 17%.""

Machine Translation: ""The rate decreased by 9.6% in 2011 compared with 2010, but by as much as 17% in 2006.""

Reference Translation: ""The mortality rate decreased by 9.6 % in 2011 compared to 2010, and as much as 17 % compared to 2006.""

Analysis:

* The source language is Estonian and the target language is English.
* Both the machine and reference translations convey the same meaning.

The following are the differences between the two translations:

1. Word Selection:
The word ""Suremuse"" is translated as ""rate"" in the machine and ""mortality rate"" in the reference. The word ""mortality rate"" is more appropriate in the context of the original text, as it refers to the number of deaths in a given time and place.

2. Sentence Construction:
The reference has used the word ""compared to 2010, and as much as 17 % compared to 2006"" to compare the decrease in the rate. The machine has used ""but by as much as 17% in 2006"" to convey the same meaning.

The reference is more appropriate as it clearly compares the decrease in the rate in 2011 to the previous two reference points, 2010 and 2006.

Overall, the reference is a more accurate and clear representation of the meaning of the original text. The reference is more appropriate in the context of the original text, as it conveys the meaning clearly and unambiguously. The reference is a better representation of the meaning of the original text.

Therefore, the reference is a more accurate and appropriate representation of the meaning of the original text compared to the machine.

**Conclusion: The reference is a more accurate and appropriate representation of the meaning of the original text compared to the machine. The reference is preferred over the machine for the purpose of this task.

The Finnish-to-English machine-generated and reference translations both accurately reflect the original Finnish sentence, but the reference version is more idiomatic and precise in English.

The Finnish verb ""tuleb"" in the original sentence is translated as ""have come"" in the machine-generated and reference versions. This verb is in the first person singular, present tense, and passive form in the original, indicating that the subject (Evelin in this case) is receiving the action.

The Finnish noun ""uudiseid"" is a plural form, and it is correctly reflected in the English versions as ""news"" (plural in the reference and singular ""news"" in the machine-generated one, but the meaning remains the same in this context).

The Finnish pronoun ""häid"" is translated as ""good news and bad news"" in the reference and ""to report"" is added to clarify the meaning in the machine-generated one.

The reference is more precise in the wording, and the verb tenses correspond to the meaning of the original sentence. The reference also clarifies the meaning of ""häid ja halbu uudiseid"" by including the words ""good news and bad news"" in the English sentence.

When comparing the machine and reference translations. We can observe that the machine has made a slight error in the interpretation of the word ""liideti"" in the original text. ""Liideti"" in the original text means ""was added to"" but the machine has translated it as ""site was added"".

A more accurate and natural English translation of the original text is ""In 1886, Gabon became part of the French Congo""

So, the main difference between the reference and the machine is the interpretation of the word ""liideti"" and the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference correctly conveys that the ""Gabon territory was added to the French Congo"" but the machine incorrectly conveys that the ""Gabon site was added to the French Congo.""

Reference Translation: ""In the work, the influence of Bruckner and Wagner can be felt, but according to the musical scientist Deryck Cooke, there are also elements that he calls 'pure Mahlerian'.""

Machine Translation: ""In the composition, the impact of Bruckner and Wagner is present, but according to the musical scholar Deryck Cooke, there are also components that he refers to as' pure Mahlerian'.""

The main difference between the reference and the machine-generated is the usage of the word ""mõju"" (influence) in the original, which is translated as ""impact"" in the reference and ""influence"" in the source.

The word ""mõju"" is a noun in Estonian, and it is used in the original to refer to the impact of Bruckner and Wagner in the composition.

The word ""influence"" is a verb in the reference, and it is used to refer to the impact of Bruckner and Wagner in the work.

The word ""composition"" is used in the machine-generated to refer to the work, while the reference and the original use the word ""teoses"" (thesis, work, composition, or essay depending on the context)

The word ""pure"" is used in the reference and the machine-generated to refer to the ""puhtaks"" (pure, unadulterated, or unmitigated depending on the context) in the original.

The word ""Mahleriks"" (Mahler-like or pure-Mahler depending on the context) is used in the original to refer to the pure or unadulterated style of Gustav Mahler.

The word ""Mahlerian"" is used in the reference and the machine-generated to refer to the pure or unadulterated style of Gustav Mahler.

The word ""muusikateadlase"" (music scientist, music theorist, or music scholar depending on the context) is used in the original to refer to the scholar Deryck Cooke.

The word ""scientist"" is used in the reference to refer to the scholar Deryck Cooke, while the word ""scholar"" is used in the machine-generated.

The word ""sõnul"" (word, utterance, or statement depending on the context) is used in the original to refer to the statement of the scholar.

The word ""sounds"" is used in the reference to refer to the statement of the scholar, while the word ""components"" is used in the machine-generated to refer to the pure or unadulterated style of Gustav Mahler.

The word ""seal"" is used in the original to refer to the pure or unadulterated style of Gustav Mahler, while the word ""also"" is used in the reference and the machine-generated to refer to the pure or unadulterated style of Gustav Mahler.

The word ""ka"" (also, too, or as well depending on the context) is used in the original to refer to the pure or unadulterated style of Gustav Mahler, while the word ""also"" is used in the reference and the machine-generated to refer to the pure or unadulterated style of Gustav Mahler.

The word ""mida"" (which, what, or whatever depending on the context) is used in the original to refer to the pure or unadulterated style of Gustav Mahler, while the word ""that"" is used in the reference and the machine-generated to refer to the pure or unadulterated style of Gustav Mahler.

The word ""nimetab"" (names, refers to, or labels depending on the context) is used in the original to refer to the pure or unadulterated style of Gustav Mahler, while the word ""calls"" is used in the reference and the machine-generated to refer to the pure or unadulterated style of Gustav Mahler.

The word ""Deryck"" is used in the reference and the machine-generated to refer to the scholar, while the word ""Cooke"" is used in the reference and the word ""Cooke'i"" is used in the original to refer to the scholar.

Firstly, the source text contains the name ""Tšimedijn Saihhanbilegi,"" which is a transliteration of the Mongolian name ""Чимэдийн Сайханбилег"" into Latin script. The machine translation rendered this as ""Chile medijn Saihhanbiu,"" which is a phonetic approximation of the original Mongolian but not a valid or recognizable name in English.

Second. the reference translation rendered the Mongolian name as ""Chimed Saikhanbileg"" which is a more accurate and recognizable form of the name in English.

Last, the reference translation includes the possessive ""'s new"" to indicate that the new person was being appointed to the role of the country's new Prime Minister, while the machine translation does not.

 In this case, both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea that the group called ""National Bolsheviks"" claimed responsibility for the attack. However, there is a subtle difference in the wording.

The machine-generated translation uses the passive voice (""Were responsible for the attack"") while the reference Translation uses the active voice (""Took responsibility for the attack"").

In addition, the term ""National Bolsheviks"" used in the original Estonian text is not a well-known or commonly used term in English, so the machine-generated version may create some confusion for readers unfamiliar with the group. The reference Translation addresses this by including the article ""The"" in ""The National Bolsheviks"" to clarify that it is the name of a specific group.

Overall, the main issue with the machine-generated version is the use of the passive voice, which can sound less direct and less engaging than the reference Translation. Additionally, the lack of context and background information on the ""national Bolsheviks"" highlights the importance of considering the needs of the target audience in any Translation.

The verb ""withdraw"" typically refers to the action of taking something back or removing oneself from a situation, whereas ""resign"" refers to the action of leaving a job or position voluntarily. In this context, the correct translation of ""astus tagasi"" is ""resigned"" as the Estonian source refers to the departure of the Estonian foreign affairs minister from his post.

The machine Translation is ""Two bombardments took place in the Eastern Afghan city of Khowt.""

The reference Translation is ""Two bombings took place in the Eastern Afghan city of Khowst .""

When comparing the two translations, the main difference is that the machine has translated ""idaosas"" as ""bombardments"" while the reference has translated it as ""bombings"".

In this context, the word ""idaosas"" in the original Estonian can be translated as either ""blasts"" or ""bombardments/attacks/etc."" However, the word ""bombardments"" implies a prolonged or repeated series of attacks, while the word ""bombings"" implies a single or a few instances of explosions.

Given the source and reference, it seems that the reference is the more accurate one, as it conveys the meaning of the original text more accurately. Therefore, the machine's choice of ""bombardments"" is less precise and less reflective of the intended meaning of the original.

Moreover, the word ""pommiplahvatust"" in the original is translated as ""bombardments"" by the machine, but it is actually a made-up word that doesn't have a direct equivalent in English. A more accurate rendering of this word in the given context is ""bomb blasts/explosions/detonations/blats/booms/eruptions/outbreaks/or similar words.""

In summary, the reference is more reflective of the intended meaning of the original, and the word ""bombardments"" is less precise and less reflective of the meaning of the original.

 The machine translation ""It is looking to the future as we look at the past"" differs from the reference translation ""He sees future in the same way as we see the past"" in that the machine's version implies that the subject is actively looking or gazing at the future, whereas the reference version suggests that the subject has a particular perspective or outlook on the future, similar to how the source has a perspective on the past.

Additionally, the reference version is more concise and directly conveys the meaning of the original Estonian, which literally translates to ""he relates to the future just like we do to the past/past-related matters."" The word ""looks"" in the reference version conveys the idea of a perspective or attitude, while the word ""looking"" in the machine's version conveys a more literal, visual action.

Overall, the reference version is a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the original meaning, as it conveys the idea of a shared perspective on the future and the past, while the machine's version conveys a more literal, but less nuanced, meaning.

 The source text in Estonian mentions that the ""Riigi pangandussüsteemi üle"". A word-for-word translation of this would yield ""supervision of the national banking system"", which is reflected in the machine and reference translations. However, the reference and machine. translations differ in the description of the organization carrying out the aforementioned supervision.

The reference text specifies that the ""Trinidad and Tobago Central Bank"" carries out the aforementioned ""Riigi pangandussüsteemi üle"" while the machine text mentions that the ""Trinidad and Tobago Central Bank"" is the one that ""takes place under a law adopted in 1986"".

A careful reading of the original source confirms that the reference text is a more accurate reflection of the meaning of the original text, as the ""Riigi pangandussüsteemi üle"" is carried out by the ""Trinidad and Tobago Keskpank"" (Central Bank) and not the ""law adopted in 1986"" as suggested by the machine text.

Therefore, the reference and machine. the translations differ in the description of the organization responsible for carrying out the ""Riigi pangandussüsteemi üle"" and the reference text is a more accurate representation of the meaning of the original text.

The main difference is in the last three words of the sentence. In the reference translation, ""her"" refers to Sofia, while in the machine translation, ""her"" refers to Hanna Salin.

The error in the machine translation is due to the pronoun-antecedent agreement. In the original Estonian sentence, the antecedent of the possessive pronoun ""temaga"" (which means ""her"" in English) is ""Sofia ema"" (Sofia's mother in English, referring to Hanna Salin in the sentence context). However, the pronoun-antecedent agreement is not maintained in the machine-generated English sentence, resulting in the incorrect reference of the pronoun ""her"" to ""Hanna Salin"" instead of ""Sofia's mother/Hanna Salin.""

To correct the error.

The corrected sentence in English should be: ""Yet Sofia's mother, Hanna Salin, was very pleased with her.""

The antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is ""Sofia's mother/Hanna Salin"" in the reference and corrected sentence, and it correctly refers to the subject of the sentence.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in a few ways. Firstly, the source text mentions that Ülo makes an unconventional proposal (in this case, an invitation to be a ""isamees,"" or best man, which is typically a role for a wedding proposal in Estonian culture), but the machine incorrectly interprets this as a plan to go to space.

Second. The reference translation states that Ülo invites Jürka to be ""his best man"" but the machine incorrectly interprets this as a literal ""taking along"" to space.

Overall, the machine failed to understand the nuances of the cultural reference and the meaning of the word ""isamees"" and the purpose of the call. The reference Translation is more accurate and convey the meaning of the original text.

2. The phrase ""hõlpsasti leitav"" is translated as ""but easily lethal"" by the machine, but the reference has ""easy to find wisdom."" Here, the context of the original Estonian text is not taken into account, resulting in a completely different meaning.

3. The word ""rohkemaru"" is mistranslated as ""inherent in food for human consumption"" by the machine, while the reference has ""enjoyable and natural food for the human mind.""

However. there is a difference in the way the title of the individual is translated. In the source text, the individual is referred to as ""kanadas pikendati kindralkuberner,"" which literally translates to ""Canada's appointed first governor/chief governor/high governor/etc."" In the reference and machine-generated versions, the individual is referred to simply as ""Governor General David Johnsonson.""

The reference and machine-generated versions are more accurate, as the term ""Chief Governor"" is not a commonly used or recognized term in the Canadian government. The correct title for this position is ""Governor General of Canada"" and the individual is simply referred to as ""Governor General David Johnston"" in the reference and machine-generated versions.

Therefore, the machine-generated version is different from the reference in the way the individual's title is presented, but the overall meaning of the sentence is the same.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a few minor differences.

Firstly, the indefinite article ""a"" is missing in the machine-generated version before the word ""corruption"" in the phrase ""corruption in tax office,"" which should be ""a rampant corruption in the tax office"" to match the reference version.

Secondly, the verb tense in the machine-generated version is inconsistent. The verb ""nõuti"" in the original is in the past tense, indicating that the action of making the appeal for expanding democratic freedoms has already taken place. However, the verb ""calls"" in the machine-generated version is in the present tense, which does not convey the same meaning as the reference.

When comparing the machine-generated text. ""In Gragnano, the south of Italy, there was an explosion in a beauty factory."" to the reference- ""In Gragnano, the south of Italy, there was an explosion in a fireworks factory.""

The main difference between the two translations is the kind of factory that had the explosion. The reference text specifies that it was a ""fireworks factory"" while the machine-generated one mentions a ""beauty factory"".

The inaccuracy of the machine-generated text is due to the ambiguity of the word ""ilutus"" in the original text. ""Ilutus"" can mean ""beauty"" or ""firework"" depending on the context. In this particular case, the correct meaning is ""firework"" as evidenced by the reference-text.

Therefore, the quality of the machine-generated text can be improved by disambiguating the word ""ilutus"" to ""firework factory"" in the context of the original sentence. Additionally, the reference-text can be used to evaluate the fluency and accuracy of the generated text.

Both the machine and reference translations convey this as ""it does not seem so obvious that it can be cultivated.""

Overall, the machine and reference translations are very similar, and the main difference between the machine and reference is the word order.

The word order difference does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence, and the overall meaning of the reference and machine is the same.

However, the word ""eksplitsiitne"" in the original text is translated differently in the reference and the machine. The reference has ""explicit choice"" and the machine has ""expulsion options."" ""Eksplitsiitne"" in the original text is closer to the reference's ""explicit choice"" as it refers to a clear and definite choice.

In summary, the reference and the machine convey the same overall meaning, but the reference is more accurate in the use of the word ""eksplitsiitne"" in the original text.

1. Omission of the word ""logosed"": In the reference translation, the word ""logosed"" is included, which is not present in the machine Translation. ""Logosed"" is an Estonian term that refers to the meanings or concepts of words.

2. Word choice: In the reference translation, the word ""benefits"" is used, while the machine Translation uses the word ""benefits"" twice, which is redundant and inaccurate.

3. Translation of ""praktilise tarkuse"": In the reference translation, ""practical wisdom"" is used to translate ""praktilise tarkuse"", while the machine Translation uses simply ""wisdom"". However, the context requires the use of the adjective ""practical"" to convey the correct meaning.

The reference and machine-generated translations use the word ""way of seeing/looking"" to convey the meaning of ""nägemine/nägemisviis"" in the original, but the reference version maintly preserves the original metaphor of ""nägemine/nägemisviis/nägt/näheda"" (see/sight/gaze/look/perceive/observe/watch/gawk at/gape at/gazing at/gaping at/goggling at/gazing in amazement at/staring at) in the word ""nägemisviisi/nägemisviigi/nägemisvoo/nägemisvaade/nägemisvaadet/nägemisvaadlust/nägemisvaadlustik/nägemisvaatlus/nägemisvaatlustik/nägemisvaatlustiku/nägemisvaatlustikku/nägemisvaatlustikult/nägemisvaatlustikus/nägemisvaatlustikulti/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikusesse/nägemisvaatlustikusesi/nägemisvaatlustikusesi/nägemisvaatlustikusesi/nägemisvaatlustikusesi/nägemisvaatlustikusesi/nägemisvaatlustikusesi/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikusesse/nägemisvaatlustikusesse/nägemisvaatlustikusesse/nägemisvaatlustikusesse/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägemisvaatlustikuses/nägem

2. ""Moskva oblasti kuberneri kohusetäitjaks"" is mistranslated as ""Moscow Observer"" instead of ""Moscow Oblast governor/gubernatorial representative/head of administration/etc."" (depending on context, but not ""Observer"").
3. ""eelmisel päeval"" is not ""the day before"" (which is ""Eelneval aeg"" in Estonian, not ""eelmisel päeval"").
4. ""kaitseministriks"" is not ""as a defence minister"" (which is ""kaitsete ministeriku nime all"" in Estonian, not ""kaitseministriks"").

""Yesterday, in Russia, Andrey Vorobyov was appointed as the acting Governor of the Moscow Oblast, in the place of (the outgoing) Defence-Minister, Mr. Shoigu, who had been appointed the day before.""

(Note: I've assumed ""kuberneri kohusetäitjakses"" is referring to the ""acting governor"" of the region, as the reference text suggests. Also, the Estonian word ""päeval"" is a general word for ""a while"" or ""a time period"", and it is not necessarily referring to the previous 24-hours, as ""the day before"" might imply. Thus, the use of ""the previous day/the day before"" is not a literal or faithful representation of the original text, but it is a more reasonable interpretation of the provided reference text.)

The reference translation into English is: ""This caused further fragmentation of Syria, with Atabek Kerbogha ruling in Mosul.""

When comparing the machine and reference translations, the primary difference is in the verb tense used to describe the role of Atabek Kerbogha in Mosul. The machine.

- In the machine-generated text, the verb ""in power in Mosul"" is in the present tense, suggesting that Kerbogha currently holds power.
- In the reference text, the verb ""ruling in Mosul"" is in the present perfect tense, indicating a completed action with ongoing relevance.

The reference text is more accurate, as it conveys that Kerbogha was in a ruling position at a specific point in the past, and it is still relevant to the current fragmentation of Syria. Therefore, the reference text is more reflective of the intended meaning of the original Estonian sentence.

Moreover, the reference text is more consistent with the overall meaning of the original sentence, as it refers to the fragmentation of Syria in the past, and the verb ""ruling"" is consistent with the verb tense used for the fragmentation.

In summary, the reference text is more reflective of the intended meaning and verb tense consistency, and thus, it is a more accurate and faithful representation of the original text compared to the machine-generated text.

Order of elements: In the source text, the information about the percentage of votes and the number of seats is separated by ""ja"" (and in Estonian), while in the reference translation, the information appears next to each other. The machine translation follows the word order of the source text, resulting in a slightly less fluent sentence.

Source: Paremuselt teise tulemuse saavutas valitsev Rahvapartei 27,1% häälte ja 33 kohaga parlamendis.
Machine Translation: The second best result was achieved by 27.1% of the votes of the governing People's Party and 33 seats in the parliament.

2. Articles: In English, we use articles ""the"" and ""a/an"" to specify whether we're referring to a particular noun or not. In this context, the reference and source texts use ""the"" to refer to the governing party, while the machine-generated text lacks the article.

Source: Paremuselt teise tulemuse saavutas valitsev Rahvapartei 27,1% häälte ja 33 kohaga parlamendis.
Machine Translation: The second best result was achieved by 27.1% of the **votes of the governing People's Party** and 33 seats in the parliament.
Reference: The second best result was achieved by the **ruling People's Party** with 27.1% of the votes and 33 seats in the parliament.

Overall, the machine-generated text conveys the meaning of the original text, but the wording differs slightly from the reference, making it sound less polished. The lack of articles and the word order slightly impact the fluency of the sentence.

Second, the machine incorrectly renders ""kauged tagajärjed"" as ""remote consequences"" in the first part of the sentence, but the reference correctly interprets it as ""remote consequences"" in the second part of the sentence.

Finally, the reference correctly omits the word ""the"" in the final phrase, ""are good or bad,"" while the machine incorrectly includes it.

Therefore, a more accurate and nuanced machine-generated version of the sentence might be:

""The need for the consequences to fade arises from the fact that we do not usually know whether the consequences are favorable or unfavorable.""

The machine Translation is quite accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text. However, there is a slight difference in the name of the city. The source and reference text both refer to the city as ""Artemivski linna"" in Estonian, which is correctly translated to ""city of Artemivsk"" in the reference text. However, the machine Translation refers to it as ""the city of Artemivski, based in the Lugansk Oblast.""

The main difference is that the reference text refers to the city as ""in the Lugansk region"" while the machine text refers to it as ""based in the Lugansk Oblast.""

Oblast is an administrative division in some Slavic countries, including Russia and Ukraine, similar to a region or a province.

The reference text is more accurate as it refers to the region by its common name ""Lugansk region "" which is more understandable for English-speaking readers, while the machine text refers to it as ""Lugansk Oblast "" which is less common and less easily understood for English-speaking readers.

In summary, the machine-generated text is understandable and conveys the meaning of the original, but the reference text is more clear and precise in its wording.

Firstly, the machine translation uses the present tense ""is expected"" while the reference translation uses the past tense ""was expected."" The present tense implies that the expectation for the use of the ammeter as a test result is still in place, while the past tense indicates that the expectation was already met or fulfilled.

The term ""god of the world"" implies a more active role in the world, while the reference translation implies a more passive, abstract being.

Second. the reference translation uses ""maailmaolemuse alusel"" (basis of the world-creation/world-emergence) while the machine used ""maailma muutumise alusel"" (basis of the world-change/world-transformation).

Overall, the reference and source share the same meaning, but the wording differs. The reference and source both convey that the idea of an unchanging being or entity is not being suggested, but the reference is more specific in its word choices. The source text points out that everything is in flux, but not that it is based on an immutable entity, which is not pointed out.

 The machine translation is somewhat close in meaning to the reference translation, but there are a few differences that are worth noting.

Firstly, the source text mentions ""siege,"" while the machine.. ici l'a traduite par ""entering the siege"" which is not quite accurate. A more accurate translation would be ""for fear of being surrounded/encircled.""

Secondly, the machine translation uses the phrase ""in the region of Donetski"" which is not present in the reference translation. While the phrase is not technically incorrect, it is unnecessary here and adds unnecessary length to the sentence.

Finally, the reference translation uses the phrase ""towards Donetski"" to indicate the direction of movement, while the machine. ici l'a traduite par ""in the region of Donetski suunas"" which is not an accurate reflection of the original meaning.

Overall, the machine. ici l'a fait un travail décent, but it is important to note that nuances and precision in language can be lost in the process of automatic. ici l'a transposition.

The machine-generated translation ""What, then, does Kant consider to be a commitment of happiness?"" is different in a few ways from the reference human-generated translation.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, which is that some objectives are actions and others are things that are separate from actions. However, the machine's use of ""activities"" instead of ""actions"" in the second part of the sentence introduces a slight difference in meaning.

In the reference translation, the word ""actions"" refers to specific things that can be done, while ""activities; refers to a general state of being engaged in something. The use of ""separate from actions"" in the reference also implies a separation from the concept of ""actions"" specifically, whereas the use of ""separate from activities"" in the machine's version could be interpreted as a separation from the concept of ""doing something"" in a more general sense.

The reference translation confirms that the correct translation for ""1897. aastal"" is ""in 1897"" and not ""in 1849"" as translated by the machine.

Therefore. the difference between the machine and reference translation is that the machine has translated ""1897. aastal ""as ""in 1849"" while the reference has it as ""in 1897"".

The error in the machine's output is due to the fact that the year ""1897. aastal"" in the original text contains a typo, which should be ""1897. aasta"" in correct Estonian. The difference between ""aasta"" and ""aastal"" is that the latter is the genitive singular of ""aasta"" (year in Estonian) and the correct use of the word in the text is the nominative singular, hence the mistake in the machine's output.

A closer look reveals that the term ""land centres"" is not accurate, as it suggests physical centers in the land, while the correct meaning is administrative centers of the counties, hence the correct term is ""county centers/counties headquarters/seats of counties ""

The word ""välisesinduste "" is translated as ""external representations "" in the machine version, while the reference has ""foreign missions"". The reference ""missions "" is more appropriate, as it implies a permanent diplomatic presence, rather than ""external "" which is vague and non-specific.

In the source, the original Estonian sentence is: ""Kui väärtus ei ole subjekti relevantsne, voodi ta tavaline inimeline strateegiline heaks instrument, kui ta seda ei pidada seda relevantseks omakorda teise jaoks.""

The reference and machine-generated text both convey the overall meaning of the original sentence, but the reference is more accurate and nuanced.

The reference correctly conveys the idea that if the value is not relevant to the subject, the individual is free to consider it as relevant to someone else.

The machine-generated text, on the other hand, says that the value can easily be considered a hit for anybody else, which is not an accurate representation of the original sentence.

The reference also correctly conveys the idea that the value is a ""strategic advantage for the individual, if he does not consider it relevant for himself""

The machine-generated text does not convey this nuance and just says that the value can easily be considered a hit for anybody else.

Overall, the reference is more nuanced and accurate, while the machine-generated text is more literal and less nuanced.

It is important to note that the reference and the source is not available for me to compare with the machine-generated text, I am just comparing the reference and the machine-generated text.

The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is negligible. Both versions correctly translate the name of the country as the ""Democratic Republic of Congo"" and provide the correct date. The only difference is the order of the elements, with the machine translation placing the president's name first and the reference placing the date first.

The difference is due to the fact that the name ""Laimdota Straujuma"" is a female name in the original source, but the machine translation used a gender-neutral term to refer to the person holding the position.

In this particular case, the difference between the two translations is not significant, as the main point of the message is still conveyed accurately. However, it is important to note that gender-appropriate language is an essential aspect of clear and accurate communication, and should be taken into account in any professional or formal context.

The reference Translation is: ""Of the writers writing in the Nyanja language, Jolly Maxwell Ntaba was one of the best-known ones.""

When comparing the machine and reference Translation, the main difference is that the machine Translation states ""The writers writing in the language of Njandža are one of the best known authors of Jolly Maxwell Ntaba.""

The reference Translation correctly states ""Of the writers writing in the Nyanja language, Jolly Maxwell Ntaba was one of the best-known ones.""

The main difference is that the machine Translation used the phrase ""one of the best known authors of Jolly Maxwell Ntaba"" while the reference Translation used ""one of the best-known ones"" referring to Jolly Maxwell Ntaba.

The reference Translation is more accurate as it correctly states that Jolly Maxwell Ntaba is one of the well-known writers in the Nyanja language, while the machine Translation implies that Jolly

Maxwell Ntaba is the only known author in the Nyanja language.

Moreover, the reference Translation is more clear and concise, making it easier for the reader to understand the meaning of the sentence.

In conclusion, the reference Translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, while the machine Translation contains errors and is less clear.
