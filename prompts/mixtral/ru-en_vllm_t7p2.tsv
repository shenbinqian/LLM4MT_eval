0	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The source text in Russian is idiomatic, saying ""Бог дал два уха, а один язык"" which literally translates to ""God gave two ears and one tongue.""

The reference English translation conveys the meaning behind the idiom, which is to listen more than you speak.

However, the machine-generated English translation only provides a word-for-word rendering of the original text, and fails to convey the intended meaning of the idiom.

Therefore, the machine-generated English text differs significantly from the reference English text, as it does not communicate the same message.

To improve the quality of the Russian-to-English translation, the system should be able to recognize idiomatic expressions and translate them in a culturally appropriate manner, as demonstrated in the reference English text.

 In this case. both the machine and reference translation are identical and convey the same meaning as the source text. The correct translation of ""Наука и религия могут дополнять друг друга"" to English is indeed ""Science and religion can complement each other ..."". Therefore, the machine has produced an accurate and correct rendering of the original text.

 Both the machine and reference translations are very close in this case, and they both convey the same overall meaning. However, there are a few minor differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""beaten"". While the reference translation uses ""beaten by police"" which is more specific.
2. In the reference translation, there is a hyphen used in ""Bnei-Brak"" which is missing in the machine version.

Overall, the machine version is understandable and conveys the meaning of the original text, but the reference version is more precise and accurate.

3	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is in the use of punctuation. In the source and reference translation, there is a colon after ""Л. Петрушевская"" (L. Petrushevskaya), by which it is clear that ""наЕ Biographie"" (L. Petrushevskaya visiting) is a title or heading. However, the machine translation lacks this colon, resulting in a less clear and less polished final product. Additionally, the reference and source texts use double colons, while the machine-generated text has just one. This is a minor difference, but it can still impact the overall readability and fluency of the text. Overall, the content of the machine-generated text appears to be accurate, but the lack of proper punctuation and nuanced style make it less preferable to the reference and source.

4	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 In this case. the source text is in Russian and both the machine and reference translations are in English.

When comparing the machine and reference English translations of the given Russian text, which is ""21:10 - прогноз на будущее"", it can be observed that the reference and machine-generated versions share the same meaning.

The reference English text is ""21 : 10 - forecast for the future : "" and the machine-generated one is ""9:10 p.m. - Outlook for the future: ""

The primary difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the inconsistency in the use of the 24-hour format for time. The reference text is using the 24-hour format (21:10 means 9:10 p.

m. in 24-hour format, which is common in Russian language contexts, especially for broadcasting and scheduling purposes, while the machine-generated text is in 12-hour format (9:10 p.

m.).

Apart from the discrepancy in the format of the time, the overall meaning and intent of the text is conveyed in the same manner in the reference and the machine-generated text.

Therefore, the primary difference in the two English texts is the inconsistency in the format of the given time.

5	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is quite significant here. The source text ""Худо нажитое впрок нейдет"" literally translates to ""the badly/poorly gotten profit will not go/disappear.""

The reference translation ""What is got over the devil's back is spent under his belly"" is a more idiomatic and loose interpretation of the original text, implying that anything ill-gotten or obtained through questionable means will eventually be spent or used up in a wasteful manner.

The machine-generated text, ""The ill-gotten gains will not go away,"" is a more literal and direct interpretation of the original, but it lacks the color and nuance of the reference version. Additionally, the word ""gains"" is not an ideal choice in this context, as it implies a positive outcome, whereas the original and reference text both imply a more negative connotation.

Overall, the reference version captures the intended meaning and tone of the original more effectively, while the machine-generated text is more literal and lacks the same impact.

6	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The source text and the reference translation both convey the same meaning, which is that both the age of eligibility for an old-age social pension. and the retirement age will be gradually increased.

However, the machine-generated translation differs slightly from the reference in that it uses the word ""also"" before ""will be gradually raised"" in the second half of the sentence.

The word ""also"" implies that there is an additional piece of information being added to the sentence, but in this case, the information is redundant since both the pension eligibility age and the retirement age will be raised.

The reference translation correctly omits the word ""also"" to avoid redundancy and maintain clarity.

Therefore. the machine-generated translation is less clear and precise than the reference, and it could be improved by removing the word ""also"" to improve its accuracy and fluency.

7	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine and reference translation convey the same overall meaning, which is that the person mentioned in the source has left but has made a promise to return. However. there is no significant difference in this case as both the machine and reference translation use different words to express the same idea.

The word ""uletet,"" which is used in the source, means ""f leadership titles"" in the context of the sentence. The word ""uletet"" is translated as ""uletet"" in the machine and reference, which is accurate.

The verb ""obeschatsia"" is used in the source, which means ""promised to return"" in the context of the sentence. The verb ""obeschatsia"" is translated as ""promised"" in the machine and ""promised"" in the reference, which is also accurate.

Therefore, the only significant difference between the two translations is the use of the word ""f leadership titles"" in the reference and ""but"" in the machine. The use of ""but"" in the machine is more appropriate in this context as it emphasizes the contrast of the two ideas presented in the sentence.

Overall, the machine and reference both provide accurate and clear Russian-to-English translations, with minor variations in the wording.

8	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the interpretation of the Russian word ""малым"" which was translated as ""small"" in the machine version, but in the reference version was translated as ""content with the little/small
amount of something."" In this case, the reference version conveys the original meaning of the Russian phrase more accurately, as it implies being satisfied or content with what you have, and as a result, you will gain or receive more. The machine version, while not necessarily incorrect, does not convey the full meaning of the original phrase and may be interpreted differently depending on the context. Overall, the reference version is more nuanced and a more accurate reflection of the original meaning.

 In this case. both the machine and reference translations are identical and accurately reflect the source text, ""К вопросу о равенстве религий."" by using the phrase ""On the Equality of Religions"" in English. Therefore, it is not possible to compare and evaluate the differences between the machine and reference translations for this particular text.

However, it is worth noting that machine translation can sometimes be inaccurate, and it is always recommended to have a human translator review and edit machine-generated text to ensure accuracy and fluency. Additionally, machine-generated text lacks cultural and linguistic nuance, which can be important in translating texts related to sensitive topics such as religion.

10	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 When comparing the machine and reference translations. Both are very similar, with the only difference being the word ""savage"" used in the machine-generated version and ""crazy"" in the reference. Both convey the idea of an extreme or severe level of congestion, but ""savage"" might not be the most appropriate word to use in this context, as it can imply a more violent or aggressive connotation, while the reference version uses a more fitting word that describes the intensity of the traffic.

Overall, the two versions convey the same meaning, and the slight discrepancy in the wording is unlikely to cause confusion or misunderstanding. However, it is important to consider the connotations of words used in translation to ensure that the intended meaning is accurately conveyed.

11	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 When comparing the machine and reference translations. The main difference is in the nuance of the fear expressed by the author.

* The machine version uses ""I froze with fear"" which conveys a sense of paralysis due to fear, while the reference version says ""I was really scared"" that is more general and less intense.
* The machine version says ""I was asleep or something was wrong with my house I wonder your opinion."" The reference version says ""have I gone mad or was something wrong with my house I would like to know your opinion.""

The reference version expresses a greater level of fear and concern, as if the possibility of losing their own mind is considered.

Overall, the machine version is readable and conveys the meaning of the original text, but lack the subtle emotional impact of the reference.

Note: I am an AI language model and I am not an expert in evaluating the quality of a specific language, but I can give a rough idea of the difference in the text.

12	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a few minor differences.

1. Punctuation: In the source text. ""в других странах"" is written without a comma, while in the reference translation, it is separated by a Comma.
2. Adverb usage: In the reference translation, the adverb ""very"" is added to the sentence ""doubtful that their successors will also be Soviet-educated people.""

The adverb ""very"" adds more emphasis to the doubt regarding the next generation of leaders being Soviet-educated. However, the adverb is missing in the machine-generated version, which slightly weakens the tone of the sentence.

Overall, the machine-generated version is mostly accurate, but the subtle nuances of the reference version are missing, and the punctuation differs slightly.

13	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is quite accurate in this case, as it conveys the main points of the original Russian text. However, there are a few minor differences when compared to the reference translation.

* The machine translation incorrectly capitalizes ""doc"" as ""Doc"" in ""Tell me why you took Doc?"", while the reference correctly leaves it in lowercase as ""docktor.""
* The reference also includes italicization in the sentence ""I have already asked . I have already asked ."" to indicate that the same phrase was repeated, but the machine does not replicate this.

Overall, the machine's ability to translate the complexities of the original text is impressive, but the lack of punctuation and minor grammatical errors make the quality of the text slightly lower compared to the reference.

14	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is somewhat different from the reference translation. The main difference is in the second part of the sentence. The Russian phrase ""а цепом рыбу удит"" was translated as ""and with a chain the fish will die"" by the machine, while the reference human-made translation renders it as ""fished with a flail"".

The verb ""удит"" here means ""to fish using a specific tool or method, often a long pole with a line and hook or a net attached to it, also known as a flail or leelo in Russian"". The verb itself doesn't imply that the fished fish will die, but it's just a part of the fishing process.

The verb ""умрет"" (meaning ""will die"") is not explicitly present in the original sentence, and the reference human-made translation avoided adding words that are not in the original.

So, the difference between the reference and the given automatic Russian-English translation is that the reference is more literal and closer to the original, while the automatic one introduces an assumption that the fished fish will die.

 In this case. both the machine and reference translations are identical and convey the same meaning as the original Russian source text. The correct translation of ""не получится"" in this context is ""will not be possible/will not happen"" rather than ""will not be extradited"" as in the machine and reference translations. However, since the original source text does not mention any details about the subject of possible extradition, the provided machine and reference translations can be considered as appropriate. Therefore, the quality of the Russian-to-English machine-generated translation is not significantly impacted in this specific instance.

 Both the machine and reference translation convey the main idea of the source text, namely that the film received both admiration and criticism for depicting violence and focusing on societal class divisions. However, there are some differences in wording and style.

One difference is in the phrasing of the first part of the sentence. The machine.translation uses ""both admiration and criticism,"" while the reference translation uses ""both a wave of admiration as well as quite a bit of criticism."" Here, the reference translation provides more variation in wording, using ""a wave of admiration"" and ""quite a bit of criticism"" to convey the same idea.

Another notable difference is in the wording of the second half of the sentence. The machine.translation uses ""an emphasis on class divisions in society,"" while the reference.translation uses ""its emphasis on class contradiction in society."" Here, the reference.translation uses ""contradiction"" instead of ""divisions,"" providing a slightly stronger and more critical tone.

Overall, while both translations convey the same basic meaning, the reference.translation uses slightly more varied and evocative language to convey the same ideas.

17	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine and reference translation convey the same meaning, which is ""The eyes are ashamed while the soul rejoices."" However, there is a subtle difference in the way the message is conveyed.

The source text in Russian, ""Глазам стыдно, а душа радуется,"" literally means ""the eyes (genitive plural) are ashamed, and the soul (nominative singular) rejoices.""

The reference English translation accurately reflects the original text, with the correct use of the plural form for ""eyes"" and the present tense verb ""rejoices"" for ""душа.""

The machine-generated English text, on the other hand, uses the singular form for ""eye"" and the past tense verb ""rejoiced"" for ""душа.""

Overall, the reference and machine-generated English texts both convey the intended meaning, but the reference text is more faithful to the original text and better reflects the nuances of the original language.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"
18	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine translation and the reference Translation are very close in their wording and meaning. The only minor difference is the use of lower-case ""old city"" in the machine-generated version, while the reference version has upper-case ""Old Town.""

The reference Translation is more accurate in preserving the original wording, as the original sentence (Дан старт «Прогулкам по старому городу») literally means ""The start of 'Walks through the Old Town' "" with the upper-case ""Old Town.""

However. the difference in the case (lower-case or upper-case) used for ""old city"" does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the Sentence.

In terms of Quality, the machine-generated Translation is accurate, and the slight difference from the reference Translation is not critical.

19	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same basic meaning as the source text. However, there is a subtle difference in the way the two translations are worded.

The machine translation uses the phrase ""who wants to steal it and your information,"" while the reference translation uses ""who would want to steal your information.""

The use of ""wants"" in the machine translation implies that there is a current desire or motivation to steal the information, whereas the use of ""would want"" in the reference translation implies a hypothetical or potential desire or motivation to steal the information.

In this context, the use of ""would want"" in the reference

20	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The source text ""Может ли мой отец усыновить меня?"" is in Russian language, while the reference and the machine translations provided both are in English.

The source and the reference text are identical, with the same meaning and structure. Both convey the idea of a person inquiring if it is possible for their own father to adopt them legally.

The machine-generated text is also a correct and accurate English sentence, with the same meaning and structure as the reference and the source.

However, upon a closer analysis, the reference and the machine-generated text differ slightly in the use of punctuation. The reference text has a trailing question-mark, which is missing in the machine-generated text.

In conclusion, the source and reference texts convey the intended meaning accurately, and the machine-generated text is also correct and conveys the meaning, but differs slightly in the punctuation.

21	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The source text in Russian is ""Антипа не липа, а кожею платит.""

The machine Translation is ""Antipa pays with leather, not linden.""

The reference Translation is also ""Antipa pays with leather, not linden.""

A comparison of the two translations (machine and reference) to the original text shows that the machine and reference Translations are identical and both are accurate.

The word ""липа"" in the original text is correctly Translated to ""leather"" in the machine and reference Translations.

The word ""платит"" is also correctly Translated to ""pays"" in the machine and reference Translations.

The word ""кожею"" is a bit tricky to Translate, but the machine and reference Translators both managed to do it well by using the word ""with leather"" to convey the meaning of the original word.

Therefore, the difference between the machine and reference Translations is negligible, and the quality of the machine Translation is good.

However, it is important to note that the quality of a Translation can depend on the context and the intended use of the Translation. In this specific case, the context is not provided, so it is difficult to assess the full quality of the Translation.

Overall, the Translation of the word ""липа"" to ""leather"" is accurate, and the word ""кожею"" is well conveyed with the phrase ""with leather"" in the context of the provided text. Therefore, the quality of the Russian-English Translation provided is good.

22	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Both the reference and the machine translations convey the main idea of the source text accurately. However, there are some minor differences in wording and style.

1. Use of articles: The reference text includes articles ""a"" before ""small brochure"" and ""the"" before ""Hebrew University's Shine Center for Social Research"" and ""Israeli sociologists association."" In contrast, the machine-generated text omits the articles.
2. Sentence structure: The reference text separates the two clauses with a period, while the machine-generated text separates them with a comma.
3. Slightly different word choices: The reference text uses the verb ""has been published"" while the machine-generated text uses the verb ""was published.""

In summary, the machine-generated text conveys the same meaning as the reference text, but the word choices and style differ slightly.

 Both the machine and reference translation are very similar and convey the same overall meaning. However, there is a subtle difference in the way they have translated the Russian phrase ""Импортозамещение.""

The machine has translated it as ""Import substitution,"" while the reference has left it untranslated as ""Import substitution.""

The difference is minor, but it is worth noting that ""Import substitution"" is a technical term and translating it might lead to confusion, especially if the audience of the text is not familiar with the term. Therefore, the reference version might be considered more accurate, as it preserves the original meaning and avoids introducing any unnecessary interpretation.

Overall, the two versions convey the same meaning, and the difference in the way ""Импортозамещение"" is handled is the only significant difference.

 The difference between the machine and reference translations lies in the interpretation of the Russian idiom ""есть что слушать"" which literally translates to ""there is something to listen to/there is something to hear."" However, in this context, the idiom is used to mean that there is something to occupy one's time or attention. The reference translation captures this meaning well with the phrase ""there is the belly sound to listen to,"" which is a more idiomatic and accurate rendering of the original Russian. The machine-generated version, ""there is something to listen to and nothing to eat,"" is a more literal but less nuanced rendering of the original, as it misses the connotation of the idiom.

 I compared the machine translation and the reference translation of the ""Tesla - Q3 2018 report"" and found the following differences:

1. In the first sentence, the machine incorrectly translated ""Отчёт"" (report) as ""Q3 2018 report"" instead of just ""report.""
2. The phrase ""za poslednie 12 месяцев"" (for the past 12 months) in the first sentence was not translated by the machine.
3. The phrase ""за счет"" (due to) in the first sentence was incorrectly translated as ""at the expense of"" by the machine.
4. The phrase ""на 110 821 автомобилей"" (of 110,821 cars) in the first sentence was not translated by the machine.
5. The phrase ""на 29% больше"" (an increase of 29%) in the first sentence was incorrect as ""at 29% advancement"" by the machine.
6. The phrase ""за счет"" (due to) in the last sentence was incorrect as ""on account of"" by the machine.

These differences show that the machine struggled to translate certain phrases and expressions accurately, resulting in incorrect or missing translations. A human translator would be able to understand the intended meaning of these phrases and convey them accurately in the target language. Overall, the reference translation is more clear and precise in communicating the meaning of the original text.

3. Main verb: The verb in the machine Translation is ""saw/forty flying,"" while the reference Translation uses the verb ""saw/the magpie fly.""

The reference Translation suggests that the subject of the sentence is observing a single magpie in flight, while the machine Translation suggests that the subject observed a group of forty flying objects.

The reference Translation is more accurate, as it conveys the original meaning of the source text, which is ""The woman saw the magpie fly away/flying away/in flight."" The machine Translation is inaccurate, as it misinterprets the meaning of the numeral ""сорока"" (soroka), which is a type of bird in Russian, and not a numeric value.

The only slight variation is that the machine and reference translations use the phrase ""sacred texts"" while the original Russian text uses the phrase ""священных текстов"" which literally means ""holy texts/scriptures/writings.""

However, the use of ""sacred texts"" or ""holy texts"" here is unlikely to significantly alter the meaning of the text, as the context implies that the texts in question refer to religious texts that are considered extremist.

Therefore,. both the machine and reference Translations accurately convey the meaning of the original text, with no significant differences.

The verb ""двигать"" here can be interpreted as either ""to move"" or ""to operate"", but the reference text opts for ""how do we go forward/ahead"" which is more idiomatic and has a stronger connection to the idea of travel.

In summary.

- The machine and reference translations both capture the meaning of ""лодки-то нет""

However, the reference and machine-generated versions differ in the treatment of the second half of the phrase:

- The reference version has ""closer to the whip""
- The machine-generated one has ""closer to the whip""

The discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the word ""барин"" can be translated as ""barn"" or ""master of the house/whip-master/bailiff/etc."" depending on the context.

In this specific case, the reference version seems to be a literal quote from a famous poem by Sergei Yesenin, where the word ""барин"" is used in the meaning of ""barn-master/bailiff/stocker-man/etc.""

The machine-generated one, on the other hand, is a more conventional and widely used interpretation of the word ""барин"" as ""barn"" in the given context.

Therefore, the quality of the Russian-to-English translation provided by the machine is good, and the difference in wording is minor.

It is worth noting that the use of possessive forms in different languages may vary, and the correct use of possessive forms in the target language (in this case, English) is important to convey the meaning clearly and naturally. Therefore, it is always a good idea to review and edit machine-generated translations to ensure that they use the correct possessive forms and other idiomatic expressions in the target language.

 When comparing the machine and reference translations. The only difference I see is in the phrase ""нет ни малейшего сомнения."" The machine..mation renders it as ""have no doubt"" while the reference has ""have no slightest doubt.""

The phrase ""no slightest doubt"" is more idiomatic and emphatic in English, conveying a more complete sense of certain elimination of any doubt. The phrase ""no doubt"" is more straightforward and less idiomatic, but still gets the meaning across.

Overall, the machine's rendering is understandable and readable, but it lacks the nuance of the reference.

## Points to consider

1. The nuance of the wording: ""no slightest doubt"" is a more nuanced and emphatic way to convey the Russian ""нет ни малейшего сомнения"" compared to ""no doubt""
2. The fluency of the target language: The reference text is more fluent in the use of idiomatic expressions, making it more engaging and readable.
3. The overall meaning: The machine and reference texts convey the same meaning, but the reference is more nuanced and nuanced.

## Suggested actions

1. Consider using more nuanced and emphatic wording in the target language to convey the meaning of the original.
2. Proofread the target text for fluency and ensure it reads naturally and smoothly.
3. Seek to convey the meaning of the text in the most nuanced and nuanced way possible, taking into consideration the specificities of the target language.

 In this case.

Source text in Russian: ""Осторожно""

Machine Translation: ""Cautiously""

Reference Translation: ""Be careful""

The difference between the machine-generated translation and the reference one is that the former interprets ""осторожно"" as an adverb modifying the manner in which an action should be performed, whereas the reference one conveys a command or piece of advice to be careful.

A more accurate and nuanced human-generated Russian-to-English rendering of ""осторожно"" in the given context might be ""proceed with caution"" or ""take care"" - depending on the specific situation and meaning intended.

Overall, the machine-generated version is somewhat less precise and less nuanced in meaning compared to the reference.

The source text in Russian describes how top administrators have been discovered to have manipulated the electoral process in a surreptitious manner, thereby admitting their supporters to the ruling group while excluding the unfavorable ones.

The machine and reference translations both accurately convey the meaning of the original text, with the exception of the last few words.

The Russian word ""неугодных"" literally means ""unwanted"" or ""uncomfortable"" people, but the reference text uses the more idiomatic ""unwanted ones"" to preserve the meaning.

The machine, however, interprets the word as ""the undesirable,"" which is not incorrect, but less commonly used in English.

Overall, the reference and machine texts are very similar, with the reference slightly more idiomatic.

Quality of the machine-generated text: Good.

 The machine translation ""Ask your questions"" is generally accurate and conveys the same meaning as the source text ""Задавайте свои вопросы."" However, it is slightly different from the reference translation ""Ask away.""

The reference translation ""Ask away"" has a more informal and inviting tone, which is closer to the original meaning of the Russian phrase ""Задавайте свои вопросы."" The phrase ""задавайте"" is more conversational and encourages the listener or reader to ask questions freely.

In contrast, the machine-generated phrase ""Ask your questions"" is more neutral and straightforward, lacking the friendly and informal tone of the reference translation.

Overall, the machine-generated phrase is accurate but lacks the nuanced meaning of the reference text, and it is less engaging for the reader.

Both versions ask about the level of Russian in the essay, and the wording and structure of the sentence are very similar.

However, there is a slight difference in the use of punctuation. In the reference translation, there is a comma after ""Sorry,"" while in the machine translation, there is no punctuation after ""Sorry,"". by including the comma, the reference translation adds a slight pause, which helps to make the sentence sound more natural and fluid.

Overall, the difference in quality between the machine and reference translations is minimal, and the meaning of the sentence is conveyed clearly in both versions. However, the reference translation pays closer attention to punctuation and fluency, resulting in a more refined and professional-sounding sentence.

 The source text, ""На Крымском мосту началось пробное движение поездов"". Both the machine and reference translations render the meaning clearly as ""Trial train traffic has begun on the Crimean Bridge.""

Upon closer examination, the only noticeable difference between the machine and reference versions is the lack of definite article ""the"" in the machine-generated text before ""Crimean Bridge.""

In the reference version, it is ""the"" that appears in ""the Crimean Bridge."" The article ""the"" is necessary in the reference text to ensure proper English syntax and comprehension.

Thus, the machine-generated text differs slightly from the reference in that it lacks the definite article ""the"" in ""Crimean Bridge.""

Nevertheless, the overall meaning remains the same, and the slight discrepancy in the article is not significant enough to cause confusion.

In this case, the machine's attempt to provide additional context and clarity is consistent with the original Russian sentence, but it makes the sentence slightly wordy and less direct.

Another slight variation between the two translations is the punctuation. The reference version ends the sentence with a period, while the machine version ends with a comma. This is a minor difference that doesn't impact the meaning of the sentence, but it's worth noting.

Overall, the two versions of the sentence convey the same meaning, but the reference version is slightly more concise and direct. The machine's attempt to provide additional clarity is commendable, but it ultimately makes the sentence less clear and more wordy.

In the machine-generated translation, ""Hot"" is left in the original form, whereas in the reference translation, it is replaced with ""Hot"" in English. Presumably, ""Hot"" refers to a popular feature or category on a website, and it should be translated consistently for clarity.

The source text is asking if the railroad workers are avoiding getting to the point or beating around the bush.

However, the machine translation translates the word ""темнят"". which means ""to darken"" or ""to be in the dark"" literally. Thus, the machine-generated output results in a literal and inaccurate translation of the original meaning.

On the other end, the reference-level human-generated output correctly interprets the meaning of the idiom and accurately conveys the meaning of the original text.

The word ""epic"" in the English language can have a similar meaning, but it is more commonly used to refer to a long narrative poem, often about heroic feats and adventures.

The reference English translation correctly captures the idiomatic meaning of ""эпопея"" in the original text, and thus is a more accurate reflection of the intended meaning. The machine-generated text, on the other hand, takes a literal interpretation of the word and thus is less precise.

Both the machine and reference translations convey the general meaning of the proverb, which is about the idea that a treasury cannot both sustain and enrich you fully.

However, the reference Translation is more accurate as it preserves the original meaning of the proverb more closely. The phrase ""to the brim"" in the reference Translation conveys the sense of being fully satisfied or filled, which is closer to the original meaning than the phrase ""to feed itself "" in the machine Translation.

Moreover, the reference Translation also includes the word ""you "" which is implied in the original text but not explicitly stated. By including ""you"" the reference Translation makes it clear that the proverb is making a comparison between the limited resources of a treasury and the unlimited needs of a person.

The difference here is that the machine's attempt to interpret the meaning of the original sentence resulted in a different, nonsensical meaning.

The mistake in the machine's interpretation is likely due to the fact that the word 'волка' (wolf) is singular, but the verb in the sentence is in the plural. The correct interpretation of the sentence is that the wolves in the apiary (or orchard, or garden) are being beaten. The mistake in the machine's interpretation is likely due to the fact that it did not recognize the word as a singular, and assumed that the verb referred to multiple wolves.

In this case, the reference and the original convey the same meaning, but the machine's interpretation is incorrect.

1. Article Usage: The reference translation includes the indefinite article ""a"" in ""St. Petersburg churches,"" while the machine and source texts lack articles.

Source: ""Все петербургские храмы обязали отправить прихожан на крестный ход вокруг Исаакия""

Reference Translation: ""All St. Petersburg churches were obliged to send parishioners to the procession around St. Isaac""

Machine Translation: ""All St. Petersburg churches were obliged to send parishioners to the procession around St. Isaac""

2. Word Selection: The word ""pray"" in the reference text might not accurately convey the meaning of the original verb ""вести"" (to lead, to guide, to direct, to take part in). ""Parade/procession/march/etc."" is a more fitting equivalent for the word ""крестный ход"" (lit. ""cross-road,"" but in this context, it refers to a religious march or parade).

3. Sentence Variety: The reference and source texts use the passive form, but the machine-generated text is written in the active.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very similar and accurately reflect the source text, reading: ""Opposition rallies in Russian cities on May 5.""

However. if we compare the two translations in more detail, we can see that the reference manual slightly differs in capitalization. In the reference, the word ""Russian

"" is capitalized, but in the machine, it is not. This is a minor difference, but it is important to note that capitalization in English can depend on the specific context and purpose of the writing.

Moreover, the word ""cities"" in the reference is written with a lowercase ""c"" while in the original Russian, it is written with a capital ""G."" In the original, the word ""cities"" is used as a proper name, and it is referring to specific cities in Russia, where the opposition rallies took/will take place.

In the machine, the word is written with a lowercase ""c"" as it is a general term, and it is not referring to any specific cities.

In summary, the machine's output is accurate, but it slightly differs in the word ""cities"" and lack of proper naming. The reference is more accurate in this case, as it reflects the original text's meaning.

To improve the quality of the Russian-English translation, the machine should be fine-tuned to consider the proper naming and the specific context of the words used. Additionally, the grammatical rules of the target language, such as the proper use of capitalization, should be taken into account.

One difference is the absence of commas in the machine translation after ""one"" and ""the other."" While commas are not always necessary in English, their absence in the machine translation makes the sentence sound less fluent and natural.

Another notable difference is the lack of italics or quotation marks in the machine translation to indicate that ""Death, age, and birth"" are the subjects of the sentence, as opposed to being part of the conversation. Italicizing or using quotation marks in the reference translation can help clarify that the subjects are being mentioned, not spoken about.

Finally, the reference translation includes a lowercase ""d"" in ""Don 't"" while the machine translation includes an uppercase ""D"" in ""Don 't.""

The main difference is in the second part of the sentence. In the reference translation, the word ""grieves"" is used to translate the Russian word ""горюет"" which is in the original source. However, the machine-generated version uses the word ""burns"" to translate the same word.

The word ""горюет"" here is a metaphor, meaning that the Russian feels sad or mournful even during holidays. The word ""grieves"" captures this meaning well, while ""burns"" does not.

Moreover, the word ""Yid"" used in the machine-generated version is considered derogatory and offensive, and should not be used. The reference and original texts use the word ""Russian"" to refer to the people, not the language.

Therefore, the machine-generated version differs. from the reference in terms of accuracy, cultural sensitivity, and appropriateness.

When comparing the two translations. I notice that the reference text seems to be using first name and last name initial, which is a common way to refer to famous or important individuals in a more formal or official manner. The reference text thus says ""Leah A.""

The machine-generated text, however, simply repeats the full name.

Therefore, the main difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is that the reference has used a more official or respectful form of address, while the machine-generated version is more straightforward. Depending on the intended tone and audience, the machine-generated version may be seen as less refined.

It's important to note that the reference text might be slightly different from the original source, as it's not provided.

A good evaluation of a machine-generated text has to take into account factors like fluency, accuracy, style, and tone. In this particular example, the fluency and accuracy of the machine-generated version are correct, but the lack of style adaptation compared to the reference might be seen as a shortcoming.

 In this case. both the machine and reference translations are identical and accurate. The Russian phrase ""были ли выборы плебисцитом?"" directly translates to ""Was the election a plebiscite?"" in English. Therefore, the machine's translation successfully conveyed the meaning of the original text.

However, it is important to note that the quality of a machine's ability to accurately and fluently convey meaning in a different language can vary depending on the context and the specific words or phrases used. Additionally, a human evaluator can consider factors beyond literal meaning, such as style, tone, and register, that may not be captured by a literal word-for-word or phrase-for-phrase approach.

In this specific case, the machine's output is correct and reflects the original text, but a human evaluator should consider additional linguistic and cultural factors to ensure the highest level of fluency and accuracy.

119	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation lies in the addition of the word ""there"" in the reference translation. The correct translation of the Russian sentence ""Какие роли будут на канале?"" should include ""there"" to maintain the original meaning.

English grammar requires the use of the anticipatory ""there"" in certain constructions, such as when asking about the existence or presence of something. In this context, the reference Translation ""What roles will there be on the channel?"" is more appropriate, as it correctly conveys the meaning of the original sentence, implying the existence or appearance of certain roles on the channel.

On the other hand, the machine-generated Translation ""What roles will be on the channel?"" lacks the word ""there"" and, as a result, sounds less fluent and less accurate in English. Therefore, it is essential to consider the nuances of the target language when performing machine Translations.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a few minor differences.

1. Word order: In the source text. the word ""он"" (he) is omitted, as it is clear from the context that the subject of the sentence is a male speaker being discussed. The machine translation includes ""he"" in the sentence, which is not necessary.
2. Word usage: The word ""просмотрела"" (watched) in the source text is translated correctly in the reference, but the machine seems to have interpreted it as ""looked through"" which is also correct, but slightly different in meaning.
3. Word omission: The word ""it"" is added in the reference, but not in the machine, which can make the sentence sound slightly awkward in English.

Overall, the machine's Russian-to-English skills are quite proficient, but the subtle nuances of the language and the context of the conversation can sometimes be missed, leading to slight discrepancies in the final result.

 Both the machine and reference translation are very close to the original Russian text, which is: ""6. Пока лнр на антимайдане скакали, днр работали.""

However, upon comparison, the reference and machine-generated translations are identical, which is unsurprising since the reference is already quite literal and doesn't differ significantly in meaning.

Thus, the primary difference between the original and the provided versions is the lack of diacritical marks (mahc Pierian in the Cyrillic text ""лнр"") in the original, which is not relevant to the meaning and the subsequent English translations.

Therefore, the analysis of differences between the reference and the machine-generated English text essentially comes down to the comparison of the reference and the original, which are identical in this instance.

The machine-generated English version renders this as ""an education worker,"" while the reference version sticks closer to the literal meaning of the original and says ""a worker in the field of education.""

While both versions are grammatically correct and convey the same overall meaning, the reference version may be slightly more precise and clear about the specific role or responsibilities of the person being referred to.

In this case, the reference version might be a better reflection of the intended meaning of the original text, as it emphasizes the idea that the person being interviewed is not just any worker, but specifically someone who works in the education field.

 When comparing the machine and reference translations. In this case, the difference is in the word ""подруга"" which was translated as ""girlfriend"" in both versions. However, the context and meaning of ""подруга"" here implies a female friend or acquaintance, rather than a romantic partner or girlfriend.

Therefore, the reference English version more accurately reflects the meaning of the original Russian by using the phrase ""my girlfriend"" to refer to a female friend or acquaintance, not a girlfriend in the romantic sense.

Machine Translation: 0/1 point (for using the same word, ""girlfriend"", in the target language for the original word, which can be translated differently depending on the context and meaning of the word in the original language)

Reference Translation: 1/1 point (for using the more appropriate and nuanced phrasing of ""my girlfriend"" to convey the meaning of the original word in the given context and meaning in the original language)

Overall, the reference English version is more nuanced and accurate in reflecting the meaning of the original Russian, and thus, it is a more preferable and accurate version of the two.

The source text, in contrast, literally translates to ""Even a stick (or branch) can only 'shoot' or perform its function once a year, meaning that even something that is rarely used or useful can still be useful at certain times.

In summary, the reference English idiom conveys a similar meaning to the original Russian, but the literal word-for-word translation of the source is not an accurate or well-known English idiom. The machine-generated English text is not an accurate or well-known English idiom either. Therefore, the reference English text is more accurate and appropriate for this particular source.

 When comparing the machine translation. ""Invisible pink unicorn found to be an insult to religious feelings"" to the reference translation, ""Invisible pink unicorn was found to be an insult to religious feelings"", it appears that the only difference is in the verb tense used. The reference translation uses the past tense ""was found"" while the machine translation uses the passive voice ""was found to be"" which conveys the same meaning. In this context, the difference in translation is minor and does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence. However, it is important to note that consistency in verb tense usage can improve the flow and clarity of written or translated text. Therefore, for optimal translation results, it may be preferable to revise the machine-generated version slightly, resulting in:
Invisible pink unicorn was found to have insulted religious feelings. (using past perfect to align with reference tense) or

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original Russian source text, and they convey the same basic meaning. However, there are some subtle differences between the two translations that are worth pointing out.

One difference is that the machine translation uses the present tense (""is brought"" and ""is poured."") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was brought"" and ""was poured.""). The present tense is not ungrammatical in this context, but the past tense is more idiomatic in English when describing a lack of action in the past.

Another, more significant, difference is that the reference translation includes a pair of commas in the original sentence, while the machine translation does not. In the original Russian, the lack of commas separating the two phrases (""В лес дров не возят, в колодец воды не льют."") implies that the two actions are related. In the reference English translation, the use of commas to separate the two clauses (""No firewood is brought into the forest, no water is poured into the well."") makes it clear that the two clauses are separate and unrelated.

However, the lack of commas in the machine-generated version (""No firewood is brought into the forest, no water is poured into the well."") implies a closer relationship between the two clauses, suggesting that the two actions might be related in some way.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there is one small difference. Both translations convey the same basic meaning, which is that one covers someone else's needs or problems while neglecting their own. However, the reference translation uses the past tense ""dripped"".

The source text is in Russian, and the phrase in question is ""Чужую кровлю кроешь, а своя каплет."" The verb in the second part of the sentence, ""каплет,"" is in the present tense. Therefore, a more literal or word-for-word translation might be ""You patch someone else's roof, and your own leaks.""

However, the reference and the machine both use the past tense, ""dripped"" and ""dripped"" respectively, to convey the idea that the situation is ongoing or has already occurred.

Overall, the difference between the two is minor, and the meaning is still conveyed. However, if the distinction between the past and present tense is important in the given context, the reference is more accurate.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same basic meaning as the source text, which is ""Patients do not want to be treated."" However, there are some differences between the two translations that could affect the nuance and tone of the message.

One difference is that the machine translation uses the present tense ""do not want"". The reference Translation uses the present continuous tense ""do not want to be treated."" While both convey the same meaning, the use of the present continuous in the reference Translation adds a sense of ongoing or persistent refusal, which may be more appropriate in this context.

Another Difference is the lack of commas in the machine Translation. While not a major issue, the use of commas in the reference Translation makes the sentence easier to read and helps to clarify the meaning.

Overall, the machine Translation is accurate but lacks the nuance and polish of the reference Translation. The reference Translation conveys the ongoing and persistent nature of the problem, making it a more precise and effective Translation.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the sentence structure is rearranged, leading to a slightly different meaning. The phrase ""One day, walking down the street, everyone I know saw a bunch of guys in ripped jeans"" implies that everyone saw the group of people with ripped jeans, whereas the reference translation suggests that the action of seeing was done by ""každy koho ja znam"" (everyone I know/everyone whom I know of/everyone I run into/all those I know, roughly).

2. Word omission: The word ""ulicy"" (street) is missing in the machine-generated text.

3. Word form: ""skejtboardingu"" (skateboard) is written in one word in the original, but the reference version splits it as ""skate-boarding"" (with a hyphen, as is the convention in English).

The reference and the machine-generated text convey the same overall meaning, but the reference is more precise and literal. The reference is also more consistent with the original, as it is closer to the original word-for-word. The machine-generated text is less literal and less precise, but it is more readable and fluent.

The reference and the original differ in the word ""ulicy"" (street) that is missing in the reference.

The overall quality of the Russian-to-English machine-generated text is decent, but it is not perfect. The meaning is conveyed, but the word-for-word correspondence is not maintained.

Therefore, the machine and reference versions can be considered equivalent and there are no significant differences between them.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very similar and convey the same meaning in English. However, upon closer examination. There is a subtle difference in the way the date is presented in the two translations.

In the source text, the Russian word ""Четверг"" is used to refer to the day of the week, which is Thursday. In the machine-generated and reference-generated English text, the word ""Thursday"" is used directly.

However, the reference-generated text includes the word ""the"" in the English version, which is not present in the machine-generated text. The reference-generated text reads ""the Thursday is declared a day of rest from the protests,"" while the machine-generated text reads ""Thursday is declared a day of rest from the protests.""

This subtle but important difference in the reference-generated text highlights the importance of ensuring that articles and other small words are included in the English version to ensure that the meaning is conveyed as accurately as possible.

 Both the machine and reference translations are very close in meaning to the original Russian source text. However, there is a subtle but important difference between the two English versions.

In the machine-generated translation, the phrase ""been affected by political activism"" implies that the young people in question had some sort of negative experience related to political activity. In contrast, the reference-quality human-generated version uses the more neutral phrase ""been affected by political activity,"" which does not carry any negative connotations.

The difference in wording reflects a potential pitfall of machine-generated vs. human-generated language processing. While the original Russian text does not imply any particular emotional tone regarding the impact of political activity on the young people in question, the machine-generated English version subtly introduces a negative slant that is not present in the reference-standard version.

Therefore, in this case, the reference-standard English version is more accurate and nuanced, and better reflects the meaning of the original text.

The reference and the source share the same meaning, but the word ""taken"" in the reference is more idiomatic and natural in the context of the platform (as it is often used in the sense of ""sharing/uploading a picture/content to the platform/Pikabu/Peekaboo/Picabu"").

The word ""taken"" in the machine's proposed English version is less clear and less accurate, as it can be interpreted in a few different ways (such as ""the original was physically taken to the platform/Pikabu/Peekaboo/Picabu"" or ""the original was seized by the platform/Pikabu/Peekaboo/Picabu"").

Therefore, the reference is more accurate and clear in meaning, and the machine's proposed English version is less so.

However, the reference. transformation uses the more idiomatic expression ""easy come, easy go"" which is more commonly used and understood in English. The machine's literal translation of ""легко нашёл - easily found, легко потерял - easily lost "" does not convey the same idiomatic meaning and therefore results in a less-fluent and less nuanced final product.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source text, namely that a person named Fried, who was previously the deputy secretary of state. and chief sanctions coordinator, prevented an attempt to lift sanctions by Trump, Flint, and Tillerson in February.

However, there are some differences between the two translations. The main one is the use of the word ""treacherous"" in the machine-generated version. This word is not present in the reference or source text, and its inclusion in the machine-generated version introduversify the meaning of the sentence.

Another minor difference is the word order. In the reference version, the phrase ""in February"" is placed at the end of the sentence, while in the machine-generated one it is in the middle. This does not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence, but it can make the reading less fluent.

Overall, the machine-generated version conveys the meaning of the original sentence, but contains unnecessary and potentially misleading information, and has a slightly less smooth wording.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same overall meaning as the source text, which is a positive thing. However, there are a few differences between the two translations that are worth pointing out.

One difference is that the machine translation uses the pronoun ""it"". Without more context. It is unclear what ""it"" refers to in the source text, but based on the available information, it is possible that the pronoun could be translated as ""she"" or ""it"" depending on the context. The reference Translation uses ""she"" in this case, but without more context, it is difficult to say for sure whether this is a more accurate translation than the machine's use of ""it.""

Another Difference is that the reference Translation includes an additional comma after ""play"" that is not present in the source or the machine Translation. In general, punctuation can vary between languages, and in this case, the reference Translation follows English style, while the source and the machine Translation follow Russian style.

Overall, both the machine and reference Translations convey the general meaning of the original source text. However, depending on the context, the machine Translation could potentially be improved by considering alternative pronoun options and adjusting punctuation to follow English style.

The machine-generated English text, however, differs slightly in its use of colons. While the reference text includes a single colon after ""reform"", the machine-generated version has a double colon after ""reform!"".

 Both the machine and reference translation convey the same basic meaning and are very similar. However, there is a subtle difference in the way they handle punctuation.

In the source text. ""Россия"" is not capitalized, while in the reference translation, it is. The machine correctly capitalized ""Russia"" in the target text, but the reference manual capitalized the first letter of the first word after the dash, which is a more conventional style for lists or enumerations in English.

The reference manual also includes a period at the end of the sentence, while the machine version does not. This is consistent with the conventions of punctuation in English, where a sentence should always end with a punctuation mark, such as a period, exclamation point, or question mark.

Therefore, the reference version is more accurate and polished, as it adheres to standard conventions of English style and punctuation. However, the difference in meaning between the two versions is negligible, and the machine version is still readable and conveys the intended meaning.

 The source language sentence in Russian ""Не нашего сукна епанча"" was translated into English by a machine translation system as ""Not our cloth."" However, the reference translation provided is ""Not our level.""

The difference between the two English translations is significant. The machine translation is closer in literal meaning to the Russian sentence, as ""нашего сукна епанча"" can be translated as ""our cloth apron"" or ""apron of our cloth."" The reference English translation, on the other hand, conveys a different meaning, suggesting that the phrase in question refers to a standard or level, rather than a physical object.

In this particular case, the reference English translation is more appropriate, as the context of the original conversation or text in which the phrase appears is likely to be related to a comparison of skills or abilities, and not to physical garments. Therefore, the reference English translation is more accurate in capturing the intended meaning of the original Russian phrase.

Overall, the difference between the two English translations highlights the importance of considering the broader context and intended meaning of a source text when performing a quality evaluation of a machine-generated or human-generated translation. A literal or word-for-word approach to machine-generated or human-generated may not always be the most appropriate, and it is essential to consider the context and meaning of the original language to ensure an accurate and meaningful English equivalent.

 Both the machine translation and the reference Translation convey the same basic meaning, namely that the situation or behavior in question is not acceptable. However, there is a subtle difference in tone and usage between ""This is not normal"" and ""This is not OK.""

While ""This is not normal"" is a more objective and detached statement, ""This is not OK"" is more direct and emphatic, and often used to express disapproval or concern. Therefore, in this specific case, the reference ""This is not OK"" is a more appropriate and nuanced rendering of the original Russian phrase ""Это не нормально"" into English, as it conveys the underlying emotion and intention of the original statement more accurately.

More specifically, the word ""нормально"" in the original phrase has a slightly more nuanced meaning compared to the word ""normal"" in the machine-generated English version. ""Нормально"" can mean ""normal"" in the sense of being average, common, or unremarkable, but it can also mean ""all right"" or ""acceptable"" in a more situational or personal sense.

The reference English version ""This is not OK"" is a more appropriate reflection of the situational nuance of the word ""нормально"" in the original phrase, as it conveys a sense of disapproval or concern that is more in line with the intended meaning of the original statement.

Overall, the reference English version is a more nuanced and culturally appropriate rendering of the original Russian phrase, and the machine-generated English version is a more literal and less nuanced rendering of the same.

The machine's literal interpretation of ""кои веки"" as ""some ways, in some respects, in some manner, or in some form "" is less clear and less idiomatic in English compared to the reference's more precise and idiomatic ""once in a long time, still not about us.""

Moreover, the reference's use of ""still not about us"" implies that the subject matter of the sentence is not about the people being referred to, while the machine's ""it's not about us"" is more ambiguous and less clear in meaning.

Therefore, the reference's ""Once in a long time, still not about us"" is more accurate and nuanced in meaning compared to the machine's ""In some ways, it's not about us.""

 Both the machine and reference translation are very close in meaning to the original Russian text. However, there is a slight difference in the name ""Ilarion"" in the source text which is not present in the machine and reference translation. The correct transliteration of Иларион (Ilarion) in English is closer to ""Ilarion"" with the 'i' having a long 'i' sound. Therefore, the reference and machine translation slightly differ from the source in this aspect.

In terms of fluency and grammatical correctness, the machine and reference both provide accurate and well-structured sentences.

However, the reference and machine differ slightly in the way the name of the camp is written. The reference correctly spells ""Solovetsky camp"" while the machine spells it as ""Solovetsky camp"" with an additional 'e' in the name.

Overall, the reference and machine both provide accurate and similar-meaning sentences, but the reference slightly edges out the machine in the correct spelling of the camp's name.

 In this case, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the celestial body referred to in the expression ""до звезды/before the sun/star(s)"".

The source text in Russian, ""до звезды"", literally translates to ""before the stars/star"", but in the context of the sentence, it is generally understood to mean ""before the sun"" or ""at dawn/daybreak/morning twilight/the crack of dawn/the first light of the day/etc.""

The reference English text reflects this meaning, as it correctly renders the original Russian as ""I went out early, before the sun/dawn/morning twilight/the first light of the day/etc.""

However, the machine-generated text only interprets the literal meaning of the words, and thus, it incorrectly interprets ""do звезды"" as ""to the stars/star(s)"".

Therefore, the primary difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the meaning of the word ""звезды/stars/the sun"" in the given context.

To improve the quality of the Russian-to-English text-to-text neural machine-generated machine-generated text, the system has to be fine-tuned to understand the meaning of the given words in the context of the sentence, and not just the literal meaning of the words.

 The primary difference between the machine and reference translation lies in the word used to describe the source's sentiment. The word ""hersnia"" in the original Russian sentence is a slurred or colloquial way of saying ""scheisse"" (shit). The machine. mistranslated this as ""sherry"" instead of ""shit"" as in the reference.

A correct and natural-sounding rendering of the original sentence in English would be:

Am I alone in having such crap that I can make everything blurry at will?

The word ""crap"" is a more natural and less literal equivalent to ""hersnia"" in the given context. The word ""sherry"" is not relevant to the meaning and is a mistranslation.

Moreover, the word ""all"" is unnecessary in the reference sentence, as the original sentence only implies the existence of a single entity (the subject of the sentence).

The word ""at will"" is also a less literal and more idiomatic equivalent to ""razbasy"" (blurrily, in a blur) in the original sentence.

In summary, the reference and the correct English rendering of the original sentence differ in the use of more idiomatic and literal language, as well as the unnecessary addition of the word ""all"" and the literal mistranslation of ""hersnia"" as ""sherry"" in the machine-generated version.

1. Word-level errors:
The word-level errors in the machine-generated text stem from the literal translation of the Russian words. In the original, ""пример"" is translated as ""example"" in the reference, but the word is translated as ""science"" in the machine-generated version. This is incorrect, as the meaning of ""пример"" in this context is ""a model or pattern of behavior to be imitated or emulated by others; an example or sample for imitation or comparison; an example or instance of something to prove or illustrate a rule or quality"" (Lexico, 2021).

2. Sentence-level errors:
The sentence-level errors stem from the incorrect use of the passive voice and the word ""to others"" in the machine-generated text. The reference text correctly conveys the meaning of the original by using the imperative ""Follow his example"" to convey the idea of emulating the subject's behavior.

Overall, the reference and the source share the same meaning, but the machine-generated text differs significantly in meaning and tone. The reference is clear, imperative, and direct, while the machine-generated version is indirect, passive, and confusing.

To improve the quality of the Russian-to-English text, the system should be able to detect the meaning of the original and convey it in a clear, concise, and culturally appropriate manner.

The machine-generated version lacks consistency in punctuation, resulting in run-on sentences and unclear meaning. For example, ""уже напугал дочку, боится спать одна и в свою комнату не заходит"" should be broken into two sentences or joined with a conjunction and properly punctuated.

2. Word choices:
The machine-generated version sometimes uses less precise or slightly incorrect word choices. For instance, ""I have already scared my daughter, I am afraid to sleep alone and I do not go into my room"" (the original text expresses fear for the child, not the subject's fear of sleeping alone or entering the room, so the reference version is more accurate in this case: ""I've scared my daughter, she's afraid to sleep alone and doesn't go into her room"").

3. Word omission:
The reference version mentions ""I've cleaned the house many times, I washed everything with antiseptic"" (lit. ""Уборку проводила неоднократное количество раз, вымывала всё с антисептиком.""), but the machine-generated text omits the ""I've cleaned the house many times"" part, leading to a less complete and less accurate version.

The correct and natural-sounding English equivalent of the given Russian idiom is: ""He swung a sharp axe and split a tough block of wood (or simply, split a thick log).""

The issue in the machine and reference translations is the lack of a proper idiomatic equivalent of the original Russian expression. The literal rendering of the words ""острый топор"" (a sharp ax) and ""крепкий сук"" (a sturdy, thick block of wood, often used as target for ax-throwing or splitting in wood-chopping competitions) is misleading and does not convey the meaning of the original saying.

Therefore, the primary difference in the given source and the reference/machine-generated versions is the lack of proper cultural and linguistic adaptation of the original idiom.

 In this case, both the machine and reference translations are quite similar and accurately convey the meaning of the source text. However, there is a subtle difference in the way the two translations are written.

The source text and the reference translation use a colon to separate the title into two parts: ""Приключения"". and ""электроники"" respectively. The machine-generated translation, on the other hand, combines the two words with a space in-between, resulting in a slightly different phrasing: ""Adventures in Electronics"" instead of ""Adventures of Electronics"" as in the reference.

While both translations are grammatically correct. the reference version maintains the original structure of the title by using a colon, whereas the machine-generated one modifies it slightly.

In summary, the difference between the two translations lies in the structure and style, with the reference one being more faithful to the original. However, the overall meaning of the two is the same, and the difference in style may not significantly impact the understanding of the text.

The source text appears to be in Russian and the task is to compare the machine and reference translations in English.

First, I compared the two English versions for differences. Here, I found that the reference and machine translations share the same meaning, but the reference version is more coherent and fluent in English.

Next, I compared the source and reference versions to understand the nuances of the original text and the reference's intent. The reference and source texts convey the same meaning, and the reference is an accurate and faithful representation of the original.

Finishing the analysis, I compared the reference and machine versions. The primary differences are the word choices, sentence structure, and overall fluency.

Here are the main differences:

1. The reference and source texts use the word ""killer"" to refer to the ""Мутант"" (mutant in the source and reference texts, and the ""Murdering Machine"" in the machine-generated text).
	
2. The reference and source texts use the word ""in"" to refer to the location of the ""Murdering Machine/Мутант"" (in the reference and source texts, respectively). The machine-generated text incorrectly interprets this as ""at"" (in the ""at p. Arterm"" portion of the text).

3. The reference and source texts use the word ""town"" to refer to ""Артем"" (in the reference and source texts, respectively). The machine-generated text incorrectly interprets this as ""p."" (a common initial for ""page"" in the Cyrillic alphabet, which is used in Russian, but not in the reference or source texts provided).

In conclusion, the reference and source texts convey the same meaning, and the reference is an accurate and faithful representation of the original. The primary differences between the reference and the machine-generated text are the word choices, sentence structure, and overall fluency. The reference and source texts use the word ""killer"" to refer to the ""Мутант"" (mutant in the source and reference texts, and the ""Murdering Machine"" in the machine-generated text).

The machine-generated Russian-to-English-translation of the provided text is mostly understandable and read-flowing. However, there are some minor errors and awkward wording that make the text sound less idiomatic and less fluent in English.

For instance, the phrase ""Отцы путинизма"" in the original text is translated as ""The Fathers of Putinism"" in the reference English text, but the machine-generated version has ""The fathers of Putinism"" which lacks the article ""The"" in the beginning.

Similarly, the phrase ""разрушил остатки советской власти"" is rendered as ""destroyed the remnants of Soviet power"" in the reference text, but the machine-generated one has ""destroyed the remnants of Soviet power"" which is more idiomatic.

There are also some awkward word choices, such as ""opened the way for Putin's reforms"" in the first item, which is more idiomatically expressed as ""paved the way for Putin's reforms"" in the reference text.

Overall, the machine-generated version is mostly accurate, but it lacks the fluency and nuance of the reference English version. A professional human translator can ensure that the target text is not just accurate but also culturally appropriate and nuanced.

 Both the machine and reference translations are identical and correct. They accurately convey the sense of the original Russian phrase ""И в царство небесное даром не пустят."" The meaning is that some people will not be admitted into the kingdom of heaven, and it will not be for no reason or for free. However, it is important to note that the given source and reference. translations lack some context, which could affect the precise meaning. For example, if the subjects who will not be admitted into heaven are sinners, criminals, or certain groups of people, it is not specified. Therefore, while the provided translations convey the basic meaning, the full meaning of the original text might be better understood with more information.

 Both the machine and reference translations are very close in meaning to the original Russian source. However, there is a subtle difference in the use of quotation marks.

In the reference translation, the quotation marks are placed around ""woman's brief appeal"" to highlight that the appeal is being directly referenced. In contrast, the machine-generated version omits the quotation marks, resulting in a slight loss of precision.

The reference version correctly emphasizes that the appeal itself is being referenced, not just the content of the appeal. While the difference is minor. It is important to note that correct use of quotation marks enhances clarity and precision in communication.

Thus, the machine-generated version slightly differs from the reference in terms of conveying the intended meaning accurately.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the source text's meaning accurately. However, there are some minor differences in wording and style.

* The machine-generated translation ""The United States **said** Russia's inability to produce aircraft"" is grammatically correct but sounds less formal compared to the reference ""The United States **announced** Russia's inability to produce aircrafts.""

* The reference version slightly modifies the verb tense, using the past tense ""announced"" to emphasize the completion of the action.

* The reference also adds a possessive ""'s"" to ""Russia"" to indicate ownership, while the machine-generated one does not.

Overall, the machine-generated version is understandable, but the reference one is more nuanced and adhering closer to the original text. A high-quality human-generated or post-edited version of the machine-generated text can improve fluency and readability.

 The source language text ""Хватая воздух тухлыми культями"" was machine-translated to ""Caught in the air by fading crops"" in English, while the reference translation provided is ""Clinging to a straw.""

The reference English text ""clinging to a straw"" conveys the sense of desperation, holding on to something for support or survival. The original Russian text seems to have the same meaning, as the word ""хватая"" implies grasping, clutching, or holding on to something.

However, the machine-generated text ""Caught in the air by fading crops"" is not an accurate or meaningful English sentence and does not convey the intended meaning of the original text. The words ""caught in the air by fading crops"" lack context and make little sense in the given context.

Therefore, the machine-generated text differs significantly from the reference text, and it is essential to revise the machine-generated text to convey the correct meaning.

A more accurate and appropriate English rendering of the original text ""Хватая воздух тухлыми культями"" in the given context is ""grabbing at straws in the air/despairingly clutching at anything for

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same overall meaning, but the reference translation includes a minor difference that affects the tone and style. The reference..

translation adds quotation marks and the word ""about"" before listing the subject of agreement, which implies that the reference is being directly quoted or paraphased. This can make the reference sound more official or precise, as if it is directly referencing a specific statement made by R. Seymour.

On the other hand, the machine translation simply inserts a colon after the word ""that"" to introduce the subject of agreement, which sounds more straightforward and less precise.

Overall, the difference in tone and formality is minor, and the machine and reference translations both effectively communicate the intended meaning. However, depending on the context and purpose of the communication, the reference's use of quotation marks and ""about"" may be more appropriate for conveying a more precise and official tone.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same overall meaning, but there is a slight difference in the word chosen to express the idea of understanding or perceiving the information written by Furman by the source text.

In the machine-generated version, the word ""hear"" is used, but the reference version utilizes the word ""understand/begin to understand"" to translate the verb ""доходить"" in the source.

The verb ""доходить"" generally implies arriving, reaching, coming to something, or becoming clear, but in this context, it is more appropriate to use a word that expresses comprehension or understanding, as reflected in the reference version.

Therefore. the reference version is more accurate and a better fit for the original meaning.

 The machine translation ""And Jesus heard that the devil was racing in the wilderness"" is different from the reference translation ""And Jesus heard that the devil was in the wilderness.""

The main difference is that the machine mistakenly translated ""гоношится"". The verb ""гоношится"" in this context is closer in meaning to ""residing"" or ""present"" in the sense of ""the devil was present in the wilderness."" However, the machine incorrectly translated it as ""racing/racing in the wilderness"" (гоношится -> go-kart/race/racecars in the wilderness).

In the machine-generated version, ""тридцатистраничный доклад"" is translated as ""30-page report"" - this is understandable, but it literally translates to ""thirtieth-page report"" in the original Russian.

The machine and reference translations both use the same wording, and there are no significant differences in meaning or tone. Therefore, it is challenging to evaluate the quality of the machine-generated text in this case, as it matches the reference and conveys the intended meaning accurately.

However, it is worth noting that the quality of a machine-generated text can vary depending on the context, the specific words used, and the level of ambiguity in the original text.

282	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is somewhat close in meaning to the reference translation, but it differs in a few ways. First. the machine translation uses the words ""either"" and ""or,"" which are not present in the original Russian text. These words create a sense of uncertainty or alternatives, but in this context, they are not necessary.

Second, the machine translation renders ""будет"" as ""there will be,"" but in this context, ""будет"" actually means ""may be.""

Finally, the reference translation includes the phrase ""or may be no,"" but the original text does not have an explicit negative equivalent to ""no"" or ""not.""

Here is a more accurate and nuanced version of the original text:

Rain or snow, so be it.

This conveys the idea that the speaker is accepting whatever weather comes, whether it is rain or snow. The reference to ""so be it"" in the second half of the sentence is implied in the original, but not explicitly stated.

In summary, the machine-generated version of the text is somewhat inaccurate, and the reference version is a more faithful and nuanced representation of the meaning of the original.

 Both the machine and reference translations are quite close to the original Russian source text, and they both accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.

However, if we compare them side-by-side. We can see that the machine and reference translations use slightly different wording.

Source: я растерян, мне хочется поведать о пережитом мной.

Machine Translation: I am confused, I want to talk about my experience.

Reference Translation: I am confused, I want to talk about my experience.

Here, the word ""поведать"" is translated as ""talk about "" in the reference and machine-generated versions. However, the word ""поведать"" actually means ""to tell or narrate"" in a more literal sense.

A more literal and closer to the original meaning of the word ""поведать "" would be ""relate "" or ""narrate "" in English.

So, the reference and the machine-generated versions are accurate, but the reference version is slightly more literal and faithful to the original meaning of the word ""поведать "" compared to the machine-generated one.

Overall, the difference in this case is minor and does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. However, it is important to note that a literal and more faithful to the original meaning can sometimes be more appropriate, depending on the context and the intended meaning of the text.

The only difference between the two translations is the use of punctuation. In the reference translation, there is a comma after ""son"" by convention in English, while the machine translation does not include it.

However, the meaning of the two English sentences remains the same, and the difference in punctuation is minor. Therefore,. I would say the quality of the machine-generated Russian-to-English is good, and it conveys the meaning of the original text accurately.

It's important to note that the quality of a machine-generated text can vary depending on the specific input and the complexity of the language. In this particular case, the input is quite simple, and the two English sentences convey the same meaning, so the quality of the machine-generated text is high. However, for more complex inputs, the quality of the output may decrease, and it's important to use more sophisticated models and techniques to ensure accurate and nuanced results.

The machine-generated version, on the other hand, is somewhat awkward and literal, rendering the original Russian phrases as ""Witch"" and ""the cartoon's release"" instead of using more idiomatic English. Additionally, the verb ""uclonilsya ot otveta"" is mistranslated as ""dodged a question about"" rather than ""avoided answering a question about"" or ""refused to comment on.""

However, it is worth noting that the phrase in question is somewhat unusual and ambiguous in meaning, as the word ""почёт"" in Russian typically means ""honor"" or ""respect"" in a more abstract sense, but in this context, it could also be interpreted as a typo or a colloquial expression.

A more natural and clear phrasing of the question might be ""What is this geographical term/concept/phenomenon called in English/in English-speaking countries/in geography/...?""

Overall, the quality of the Russian-to-English machine-generated translation is good, but the lack of additional context and the ambiguity of the original phrase make it difficult to evaluate the precision and fluency of the generated English text.

However, there is a minor difference between the machine translation and the reference translation. In the reference translation, the phrase ""in Russian universities"" is used, while in the machine translation, the phrase ""in Russian universities"" is used.

This discrepancy is likely due to differences in how the possessive is expressed in Russian and English. In Russian, the possessive is expressed through a genitive case, which in this case leads to the word ""российских"" (Russian) modifying the word ""вузов"" (universities).

The difference is minor and does not significantly impact the meaning of the text. However, it is important to note that attention to detail and cultural context are crucial when performing translations, as small differences in phrasing can sometimes lead to significant changes in meaning.

The machine translation ""You can't fill the cover with fables"" is not accurate, as it misinterprets the meaning of ""закрома"" (pronounced as 'zakroma'). ""Закром"" (zakroma) is a colloquial Russian word that literally means ""a hole or a rat-hole"" and is used metaphorically to refer to something that cannot be filled or accomplished.

The reference translation, ""You can't fill a rat-hole with fables,"" is a literal translation of the original text, but it is not an ideal representation of the intended meaning in English. The reference and the source share the same words, but the reference lacks the proper adaptation to convey the meaning effectively in the English language.

A more accurate and culturally relevant English equivalent of the original text, ""Басни закрома не наполнишь,"" is:

""You can't fill a hopeless or futile endeavor with fables.""

This revised reference is more reflective of the meaning and the cultural nuances of the original text.

2. Vocabulary:

- ""schooldays"" in the reference text is a slightly more idiomatic and natural-sounding English equivalent for ""schoolchildren"" in the original text.

- ""Pioneer Brigade"" is used consistently in all three versions, but ""Komsomol meetings"" is rendered as ""general Komsomol meetings"" in the reference and ""general Komsomol gatherings"" in the machine-generated text.

3. Slight variations in wording:

- ""driven to the gatherings"" (reference text) is a more literal and word-for-word rendering of the original ""сгоняли на сборы"".

- ""were taken to the gatherings of the Pioneer Brigade and the general Komsomol meetings"" (machine-generated text) is a more verbose and less literal interpretation of the same phrase.

 Both the machine and reference translation convey the same basic meaning, which is about meeting the parents of a girl by someone for the first time. However, there are some differences in the way they are phrased.

The reference translation uses a pair of quotation marks to frame the phrase ""girl's parents,"" which the machine translation does not. The quotation marks in the reference may imply that the girl in question is already known to the person doing the meeting, or that the girl is the focus of the meeting.

The reference also inserts a comma after ""girl"" in the phrase ""girl's parents,"" which the machine does not. The inclusion of the commas makes the reference slightly more clear and readable, as it separates the individual components of the phrase.

Finally, the reference adds a hyphen to the phrase ""first time"" while the machine does not. The hyphen in the reference emphasizes that the action of meeting the parents is happening for the first time.

Overall, the machine and reference both communicate the same meaning, but the reference is slightly more precise and readable.

A careful evaluation of the two translations reveals that the reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original text. The use of commas in the reference version correctly indicates that ""жаль"" and ""Бог с тобой"" are separate phrases, whereas the repetition of ""pity"" in the machine-generated text could be interpreted as implying that the word is repeated twice in the original, which is not the case.

Moreover, the reference version maintains the same wording and punctuation as the original, while the machine-generated text differs slightly in this regard. This consistency in the reference version helps to preserve the tone and intention of the original, whereas the slight discrepancy in the machine-generated text could potentially lead to confusion or misunderstanding.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it only uses ""it"" to refer to ""Жида"" (Yid), instead of ""them"" which is used in the reference translation.

The difference in translation is due to the fact that ""Жида"" is a singular noun, and the machine incorrectly assumed that the subject is singular and used the singular pronoun in the English translation.

However, the reference correctly used the plural pronoun ""them"" in the English version, as the subject ""them"" refers to a plurality of people being baptized and drowned.

To correct the error, the machine should have used the plural pronoun ""them"" in the English version, as in the reference.

Overall, the reference is a more accurate reflection of the meaning of the original text, and the machine's error in the use of singular vs. plural is a common mistake in automatic language processing.

To evaluate the quality of the machine-generated Russian-to-English text, it is important to consider the context and meaning of the original text. In this case, the difference in meaning between the machine and reference translations is significant, as the former suggests that the rooms and roles already exist, while the latter conveys the idea that the speaker is asking for instructions on how to create new ones.

""Shapana"" is a Russian word that can be translated to ""hooligans"" or ""rowdies"" in English. However, the machine translation rendered it as ""sleepers,"" which is a significant difference in meaning.

The reference translation used the word ""hooligans"" to convey the meaning of the original Russian word, which is more accurate. Therefore, the machine-generated version needs improvement to reflect the original meaning.

Moreover, the reference translation used a colon after ""Putin and the good"" to indicate a connection or relationship between the two parts, whereas the machine-generated one did not.

In summary, the primary difference between the reference and the machine-generated version is the meaning of the word ""shapana"" and the lack of punctuation to indicate a relationship in the latter.

 Both the machine and reference translations are quite close to the original Russian text, and they convey the main idea clearly. However, there are some minor differences between the two translations.

The difference between the machine and reference translations is in the punctuation. In the reference translation, there is a comma after ""anarchist"" and after ""Nietzsche's ideal superman,"" while the machine translation does not have these commas.

In the original Russian sentence, the lack of commas after ""classic anarchist"" and ""Nietzsche's ideal superman"" suggests that the list of descriptors is continuing. In English, commas in a list of adjectives or nouns help clarify meaning and avoid confusion, so the reference translation is more accurate in this case.

Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate in conveying the original meaning of the sentence, and the machine-generated version should include the missing commas for clarity. Overall, the difference is minor and does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.

Here's the breakdown of the differences:

1. ""Бабушка (гадала, да)"": The words in parentheses ""(гадала, да)"" convey the author's confidence in the grandmother's ability to predict the weather. The words literally mean ""guessing, yes"" and convey the idea that the grandmother often correctly predicts the weather. The machine and reference translations both miss this nuance.

2. ""надвое сказала (то ли дождик, то ли снег, то ли будет, то ли нет)"": A literal translation of this part of the sentence is ""she said two things (rain, snow, whether or not)"". The reference and machine translations both interpret this as ""rain or snow"", but the reference omits the ""whether or not"" part, which is redundant.

3. ""Дождик, снег, нет"": These words mean ""rain, snow, not"". The reference and machine translations both interpret this as ""rain or snow"", but the reference is more concise and accurate.

Overall, the reference and machine both convey the overall meaning of the sentence, but the reference is more concise and accurate. The machine and reference differ in the inclusion/exclusion of unnecessary words, and the reference is more faithful to the original.

 In this case, the source text in Russian is ""Задавайте адекватные вопросы."" Both the machine and reference translations are trying to convey the same meaning in English, but the reference translation differs in using the phrase ""relevant questions"" as opposed to ""the right questions"" in the machine one.

The difference in the two translations is subtle, but it can affect the understanding of the intended meaning. ""The right questions"" implies that the questions asked should be correct, accurate, or appropriate for the given situation. On the other hand, ""relevant questions"" suggests that the questions should be related to the topic, subject, or context.

In the reference translation, the use of ""relevant questions"" is more fitting, as it emphasizes the idea of asking pertinent and related questions, especially in a conversation, a meeting, or a presentation. Therefore, the reference and the source share the same meaning, but the reference and the machine differ slightly in the nuance of the meaning.

Overall, the machine's attempt is understandable, but the reference's use of ""relevant"" is more precise and appropriate in the given context.

One difference is that the machine translation uses the present perfect tense ""has found"". In contrast, the reference translation uses the past tense ""found""

Another subtle but potentially significant difference is that the machine-generated translation uses the phrase ""a panel of theologians"" while the reference version uses ""a panel of theologists"".

Reference Translation: ""A family with multiple children from Yekaterinburg has been evicted from the apartment with scandal and threats""

Analysis:

* The subject of the source sentence is ""Многодетных"" which means ""large/numerous children"" or ""a large/numerous family.""
* The subject of the machine and reference sentences both correctly translate the Russian ""Многодетных из Екатеринбурга"" as ""a family with multiple children from Yekaterinburg.""

The verb in the sentence is ""выселили из квартиры со скандалом и угрозами"" which can be broken down as:

* ""выселили iz kvartiry"" = ""evicted from the apartment/flat/house/living space/quarters/room etc.""
* ""со скандалом и угрозами"" = ""with scandal and threats""

Analysis:

* The verb ""выселить iz квартиры"" is translated as ""to evict from the apartment/living space/quarters/room etc."" in the reference and machine translations.

The nuance of meaning of ""выселить из квартиры со скандалом и угрозами"" is not fully captured in the machine or reference sentences.

A more nuanced and idiomatic English equivalent of the original Russian might be:

The main issue with the machine-generated output is that it mistranslated the idiom ""Борода-то с ворота, а ума-то с прикалиток."" A more accurate and nuanced rendering of the original Russian expression, which literally means ""beard from the gate, and mind from the huts/courtyards/outskirts,"" is required. This idiom conveys the idea of something being very long (a long beard) but not very useful (a poor/small mind, as if it comes from humble/poor/unsophisticated surroundings, like huts or outskirts).

The reference (human) Russian-to-English, ""The beard is long, but the mind is poor"" effectively conveys the meaning of the original idiom, as it contrasts the positive (a well-groomed, possibly wise-looking, or experienced-looking person with a long beard, but also a poor/small mind, lacking in intelligence, wit, or understanding.

The primary difference in the provided source and the reference/human-generated version is the inaccurate literal interpretation of the idiom in the machine-generated text. The reference to the ""gate"" in the literal sense is not accurate, and the idea of the poor/small mind is not conveyed in the machine-generated text. Additionally, the reference to the ""courtyard/huts/outskirts"" is not reflected in the machine-generated text.

To improve the quality of the Russian-to-English automatic/machine-generated text, the system has to be fine-tuned to recognize and accurately convey the meaning of the original idiom. This can involve the use of more sophisticated algorithms, including the incorporation of more extensive linguistic and cultural knowledge.

The word ""тотo"" in the original is a relative pronoun, referring to the people who remember. The verb ""помнить"" (to remember) is used here in the imperfective form, meaning that the action of remembering is ongoing or continuous.

The verb ""помнят"" (remember in the imperfective form) is used in the reference version, and it is in the future tense, meaning that the people will remember the reader/hearer in the future.

The verb ""помнят"" (remember in the imperfective form) is used in the machine-generated version, and it is in the future tense, but it is not clear if it refers to the reader/hearer or the remembered people.

Overall, the reference version is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original, as it is clear that the remembered people will remember the reader/hearer, not the other way around. The machine-generated version is ambiguous and less clear in meaning.

 Both the machine and reference translations are by and large similar, and the slight difference in rendering the original Russian sentence is due to the use of colloquial language.

The source question is written in Russian informal language, specifically addressing a male reader, as indicated by the usage of the informal ""ты"" pronoun.

The machine-generated English sentence is also written in a conversational tone, with the word ""guy"" used twice to refer to the subject of the sentence.

The reference English sentence, on the other hand, is written in a more neutral, standard register, with the word ""guy"" appearing only once, and the verb ""likes"" used to describe the subject.

Overall, the machine-generated English sentence conveys the meaning of the original question, but with a slightly more conversational and less standardized tone.

The machine-generated text is:

Explicitly and Implicitly Ineffable

The distinction between the explicitly ineffable and the implicitly ineffable is crucial to my argument.

The reference-standard is:

The difference between the explicitly ineffable and the implicitly ineffable is crucial to my case.

The two versions differ in the usage of the word ""argument"" and ""case"" respectively.

In the source, the author makes a distinction between two concepts, the explicitly ineffable and the implicit ineffable.

The machine-generated text is a literal word-for-word translation of the original, but it is not the best fit in the context of the reference-standard.

The reference-standard is a more accurate and clear representation of the author's intent, as it clarifies that the distinction is crucial to the author's overall argument, not just to a case.

Therefore, the reference-standard is a more accurate and clear representation of the meaning of the original text, and thus, it is a better quality of the two.

In conclusion, the reference-standard is a better representation of the meaning of the original text, as it accurately conveys the author's intent, and thus, it is a better quality of the two. The machine-generated text is a literal word-for-word, but not the best fit in the context of the reference-standard.

404	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning of the original Russian phrase, which is to endure difficulties or hardships (represented by the ""thorns"" of a rose) in order to appreciate or obtain something desirable (the ""rose"").

However, the reference Translation is more direct and precise in expressing the idea of enduring the thorn to get the desirable part of the rose.

The machine-generated Translation, on the other hand, is slightly less literal and more poetic, with the word ""so"" suggesting a cause-and-effect relationship that is not explicitly present in the original.

Overall, the reference Translation is more accurate and clear, but the machine Translation is still understandable and conveys the intended meaning.

It's important to note that the difference in nuance and precision is common in machine-generated Translations, and that human evaluators should consider the context and purpose of the text to determine whether the differences in wording are significant enough to warrant revision.

 The machine translation and reference translation are very similar and both convey the main idea of the source text. However, there are a few minor differences between the two.

One difference is the use of commas. by the machine translation in ""by 2020, and as this deadline approaches, timed to coincide with the CPC's centennial in 2021"" whereas the reference translation has ""as this deadline approaches, timed to coincide with the CPC's centennial in 2021."" The reference translation is more accurate as the commas in the machine-translated text create a run-on sentence.

Another minor variation is the wording of the last part of the sentence. The reference text says ""predominantly rural regions with adverse weather conditions and backward infrastructure"" whereas the machine-generated one has ""preferentially rural regions with unfavorable climatic conditions and obsolete infrastructure"". Although the meaning is conveyed, the reference text is more precise and accurate in describing the rural and infrastructural aspects of the target population.

Overall, the machine-generated text is mostly accurate, but the minor errors and word choices slightly detract from the fluency and accuracy of the reference version.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original Russian text, which literally translates to ""the offer is good. \_but extremely unprofitable."" In this particular instance, the machine's translation is just as accurate and clear as the reference.

However, it's important to note that this is a relatively simple and straightforward example. In more nuanced or longer texts, the accuracy and fluency of a machine's performance can vary significantly.

In this particular comparison, the reference and the machine's output are identical, conveying the same meaning and tone. The word ""but"" effectively contrasts the positive attribute of the ""good"" proposal with the negative aspect of it being ""unprofitable"" or ""extremely unbeneficial"" (in the reference version, the word ""unprofitable"" is used, but the meaning is the same as the word ""unbeneficial"" in the original Russian sentence).

Therefore, in this specific instance, the quality of the Russian-to-English translation provided by the machine is satisfactory. However, it's crucial to remember that the performance of a machine in a single instance does not guarantee its overall competence and consistency in handling more nuanced and challenging texts.

The use of ""they"" in the text implies that this is something that is widely known, or happening in general.

The words in the original Russian sentence ""Стали щуке грозить: хотят щуку в озере утопить"" literally mean ""They began to threaten the pike: they want to drown the pike in the lake"" and the meaning is preserved in the English version.

Therefore, the machine and reference version are both accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original text.

408	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is somewhat close in meaning to the reference translation, but it differs in tone and precision.

* The machine translation uses the present tense. ""A little alive, a little alive"" implies that the subject is still alive, whereas the original text conveys a sense of lingering between life and death.
* The reference translation, ""more than half dead, more than half dead, but still not dead"" is more precise and evocative, suggesting that the subject is barely surviving despite being severely injured or in a critical state.

*-TRAQ* (eval):1: Precision, fluency, and terminology are all factors to consider in evaluating a machine-generated text.

1.1: The precision of the machine-generated text is somewhat lacking, as it conveys a sense of vitality that is not present in the original.

1.2: The fluency of the text is acceptable, but the lack of variation in sentence structure and word use can make the text sound repetitive and simplistic.

1.3: The use of terminology in the reference text is more precise and evocative, and conveys a clear sense of the subject's tenuous grasp on life.

2: Overall, the reference text is more precise and evocative, and conveys a clear sense of the intended meaning. The machine-generated text, while fluent.

2.1: fails to convey the full meaning of the original, and may lead to confusion or misunderstanding.

2.2: The reference text, on the other hand, effectively conveys the intended meaning, and is a more faithful representation of the original.

3: In summary, the reference text is a more accurate and evocative representation of the intended meaning, and is therefore a better quality Russian-to-English translation than the machine-generated text.

 The source text in Russian is: ""Основная мишень — пользователи"".

The machine-generated English translation is: ""The main target users are:"".

The reference English translation is: ""The main target is users:"".

The difference between the two English translations is subtle but important. The reference English version correctly conveys the original Russian by stating that ""the main target is users."" In contrast, the machine-generated English version incorrectly states that ""the main target users are,"" implying that the target users, not the product or service, are the main subject of interest. This error in the machine-generated text could lead to confusion and inaccurate interpretation of the intended meaning. Therefore, the reference English version is more accurate and preferable in this case.

 Both the machine and reference translation convey the same meaning as the source text, which is ""God is far away, and so is the king/tsar."" However. there is a subtle but important nuance that the machine fails to capture.

The word ""высоко"" in the original text literally means ""high or tall"" in Russian. However, in this context, it is often used idiomatically to mean ""out of reach or far away in power or influence "" especially when referring to a higher authority, such as a god or a tsar.

The reference and the source text both use the word ""далеко"" (dalenko), which means ""far away "" in a literal sense. However, the reference text cleverly interprets the idiomatic meaning of ""высоко"" and renders it as ""out of reach "" in English, which is more appropriate in this context.

The machine, on the other hand, literally interprets ""высоко "" as ""high "" and ""далеко "" as ""far away "" and thus, loses the nuanced meaning of the original text.

Therefore, the reference text is a more nuanced and accurate representation of the original text compared to the machine-generated one.

The machine and reference translations provided are both English translations of the Russian sentence. Both are accurate and convey the same meaning.

However, the reference and machine-generated versions differ slightly in wording. The reference version is: ""A short story about how I lay in a psychiatric hospital, how it started, what conditions were like, and how it all ended.""

The machine-generated one is: ""A short story about how I lay in a psychiatric hospital, how it started, what the conditions were, and how it all ended.""

The reference version has ""what the conditions were like"" and the machine-generated one has ""what the conditions were.""

Overall, the reference and machine-generated sentences convey the same meaning, but the reference is slightly more formal and closer to the original. The machine-generated sentence is more straightforward and literal.

However, there is a subtle but important difference between the two translations. The machine-generated translation uses the word ""performance"" to describe ""спектакль"", while the reference human translation correctly renders it as a ""production."" While the word ""performance"" is not incorrect in this context, it may convey a slightly different meaning, suggesting a live performance, whereas the original text refers to a theatrical staging or production.

Furthermore, the machine-generated version inaccurately adds a comma in the name of the sculpture exhibition, incorrectly rendering it as ""Sculptures, Which We Don't See.""

In summary, the reference human-generated translation is more accurate and closely adheres to the original source, while the machine-generated version contains minor errors that slightly alter the intended meaning.

The machine translation ""And they soaked Jesus 'loins'"" is a literal translation of the original text, but it is not an accurate or clear English phrase.

The reference translation ""And they soaked Jesus"" is also a literal translation of the original, but it is incomplete and does not convey the intended meaning.

A more appropriate and clear English phrase would be ""And they whipped Jesus's back/skin/body/etc."" depending on the intended meaning of the original.

In summary.

- The source and reference use a literal but obscure and unclear phrase in the target language
- The machine and reference use literal but unclear and incomplete phrases
- A more appropriate and clear phrase is ""And they whipped/beat/stripped/... Jesus' skin/back/body/... "" depending on the intended meaning of the original.

1. Punctuation: The reference translation includes a comma after ""unfounded,"" while the machine translation omits it.
2. Conjugation: The reference translation uses the past tense ""zvoni"" (said) for Zherebenkov, while the machine translation uses the present tense ""said.""
3. Word order: The reference translation places the attributive clause ""one can say some kind of virtual accusation"" after the name ""Zherebenkov,"" while the machine translation places it after the word ""acusation.""

Overall, the machine-generated version conveys the meaning of the original text but uses slightly different phrasing and punctuation. Additionally, the verb tense and word order differ slightly from the reference version. A professional human translator should aim for a more precise and consistent rendering of the original, taking into account the specific context and register of the text.

416	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Based on the provided source, machine translation. and reference translation, it appears that the only difference is the capitalization of the first letter of the word ""An-148"" in the reference translation, while in the source and machine translation it is not capitalized.

Capitalization rules can vary between languages and depending on the context, so it is difficult to say for sure if the lack of capitalization is a mistake or not. However, in formal English it is common to capitalize the first letter of the first word in a sentence or the name of a specific model or brand, so it is possible that the reference text is following a different style or convention.

Overall, the meaning of the two sentences appears to be the same, and the lack of significant differences suggests that the quality of the Russian-English translation produced by the machine is good. However, a thorough evaluation of the quality of a machine-generated text would require a more extensive comparison with the reference, taking also into account factors such as fluency, coherence, and cultural accuracy.

417	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine and reference translation are the same and convey the same meaning as the source text. The Russian phrase ""прежде всего"" can be translated as ""above all"" or ""before everything else,"" and in this context, it is conveying the idea of something being the most important or a priority. The phrase ""знайте, где ваш телефон"" translates to ""know where your phone is/is located/is placed."" In this case, the context implies that the subject refers to ""your phone's location/whereabouts at all times.""

Therefore, the primary aspect that distinguishes the reference and the machine-generated version from the original source text is the usage of colloquial language. The source and reference texts use the imperative mood, while the machine-generated text utilizes a more natural, conversational tone. However, this distinction does not alter the meaning of the text.

In summary.

- The source, reference, and the machine-generated text share the same meaning.
- The primary variation is the tone, with the reference and the source employing a more direct imperative, while the machine-generated text opts for a more conversational tone.
- The similarity in meaning and intent conf confirms the high-quality of the Russian-to-English machine-generated text.

418	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 When comparing the machine translation ""Pure and Innocent Hand"". to the reference translation ""With a pure and innocent hand,"" it is clear that the primary difference lies in the preposition ""with"" being omitted in the machine-generated version.

Including prepositions in a sentence is crucial as it can alter the meaning of the sentence. In this case, ""With a pure and innocent hand"" implies that the pure and innocent nature is attributed to the way the action is performed, whereas the machine-generated ""Pure and Innocent Hand"" can be interpreted as a standalone phrase, or as a description of a physical object.

Moreover, the reference version is more coherent and fluent, as it conveys the meaning more precisely. Therefore, the machine-generated version falls short in accurately reflecting the intended meaning of the original text.

Overall, the reference version is more nuanced and precise, while the machine-generated version lacks the subtle context and meaning that the reference has.

The reference Translation also includes the apostrophe and the capital letter in ""Matthew's bad"" indicating Possession, which is missing in the machine Translation.

Moreover, the Russian word ""умеет"" (uмеет) is translated as ""can"" in the reference Translation, but the machine Translation incorrectly renders it as ""Knows"".

In conclusion, the reference Translation is more accurate and preserves the meaning and style of the original sentence, while the machine Translation contains errors and omissions.

In the reference translation. there is a comma after ""said"" whereas in the machine-generated version, there is a colon.

The use of a colon in the machine-generated version is not incorrect, as it is commonly used to introduce a quotation. However, the use of a. comma is more appropriate in this context, as it indicates that the introductory phrase ""And God said"" is a parenthetical remark, and the main clause of the sentence is ""he will live forever.""

Therefore, the reference version is more accurate, and the machine-generated version should be:

The most common English spelling of the word ""божественная"" is ""bozhestvennaya"" (as per the International Phonetic Alphabet, or ""bozhdestvennaya"" in the Library of Congress system of transliteration, which is more commonly used in academic and linguistic texts and publications, but not in the case of the reference text provided).

In any case, the spelling of the word in the source and reference texts is not incorrect, but it is less common in English-language texts, and it is possible that some readers may be unfamiliar with it. Therefore, it is advisable to use the more common spelling of ""bozhestvennaya"" in future texts, to ensure that the meaning of the text is conveyed as clearly and unambiguously as possible.

* Выигрыш (win)
* с проигрышем (with a loss)
* на одних санях (on the same sledge/sleigh/sled)
* ездят (go)

A more accurate and natural-sounding English translation of the Russian text might be ""They go sledding, winning and losing on the same sled/sleigh/sleigh.""

The reference English text ""Win and lose are close to each other"" is not an accurate or faithful representation of the original text, as it does not convey the idea of sacking or sled-racing.

The machine-generated text ""Win and lose on the same sledge"" is closer to the original meaning, but it is still somewhat awkward and unclear. It could be interpreted as meaning that the same individuals are both winning and losing on the same sledge, which is not what the original meant.

A more accurate and clear English rendering of the original might be ""On the same sledge, people can both experience success and failure.""

In the original Russian text, the phrase ""особенно для тракторов ИТ-шников"" specifically refers to a type of tractor called ""ИТ-шники"" (which can be loosely translated as ""IT-shniks"" in this context, although this is not an established term in English and may not be familiar to the reader without further clarification or context).

However, the machine translation ""for IT workers"" is inaccurate, as the original text clearly refers to a specific type of tractor, not to people who work in the IT industry.

The reference translation correctly includes the hyphen in the name of the ""ИТ-шники"" tractor, and avoids the confusion caused by the machine-generated mistranslation. Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate and clear in communicating the intended meaning of the original text.

 Both the machine and reference translation convey the main idea of the source text accurately. However, there are some subtle differences in wording and style.

1. Word order: The word order in the source and reference text is slightly different. The Russian sentence features inversion of the subject and the verb, which is not reflected in the machine or reference text.

Source: ""О необходимости уплачивать проценты по займам""

Reference: ""the need to pay interest on loans""

2. Contractions: The reference text includes the contraction ""one of the reasons for the fall in revenues"" while the machine text features the full phrase ""one of the reasons for the fall in incomes.""

3. Vocabulary: The word ""revenues"" in the reference text is replaced with ""incomes"" in the machine text. Although both words can be used to convey the same meaning, ""revenues"" is more appropriate in a financial context.

Overall, the reference and machine texts convey the same meaning, but the reference is more accurate and nuanced. The word choices and word order reflect the original text more closely.

 The machine translation ""The Yekaterinburg graffiti festival ""Stenography"" will coordinate the work with the ROC"" differs from the reference translation ""The Yekaterinburg graffiti festival "" Stenography "" will coordinate its work with the Russian Orthodox Church"" in that it uses the abbreviation ""ROC"" to refer to the Russian Orthodox Church, while the reference translation uses the full name. In this case, the use of the abbreviation ""ROC"" in the machine translation may lead to confusion for readers who are not familiar with this abbreviation, as it is not immediately clear what ""ROC"" refers to. Using the full name of the organization in the translation makes it clearer for the reader and helps to avoid confusion. Additionally, the lack of capitalization in ""roC"" in the machine-generated text is a further indication that it is not using the full name of the organization, and is instead using an abbreviation. Overall, using the full name of the organization in the Russian Orthodox Church rather than an abbreviation leads to a clearer and more accurate translation.

2. Word order: The phrase ""ne chuvstvuю seбя lubimoy i skromnoy devushkoy"" in the source text is translated as ""like a loved and weak girl"" in the machine

3. Contraction: The machine fails to translate the Russian word ""тоже"" (too, also) as it is in the reference

4. Word-for-word Translation: The machine seems to translate the words one-on-one, not considering the overall meaning of the sentence.

In the reference translation, the phrase ""here"" is included, making the tone sound more personal and engaging, as if the conversation is taking place at a specific location or within a known community.

However, the machine-generated version lacks the word ""here"" and thus sounds slightly less personal and more abrupt.

Moreover, the use of ""pls"" in the reference version is a more casual and informal way of writing ""please"" and is more appropriate for the conversational context.

 The machine translation ""Promise the Lord's cause, fulfill it"" is somewhat different in meaning from the reference translation ""To promise is the Lord's business, to fulfill is that of a servant.""

In the source text. the words ""Обещать"" and ""исполнять"" are being compared, with the former associated with the idea of promising or making a pledge, and the latter with fulfilling or completing a task.

In the reference translation, the translator has captured this comparison by stating that promising is ""the Lord's business"" and fulfilling is ""that of a servant."" This implies that promising is a lofty or exalted activity, while fulfilling is a more lowly or subservient one.

The machine translation, on the other hand, states that promising is the ""Lord's cause"" and fulfilling is simply ""it"" (without any explicit comparison to a master-servant relationship). This lacks the comparison made in the reference translation, and thus loses some of the meaning and nuance of the original.

 After comparing. the machine Translation and the reference Translation, I noticed that the machine Translation is a word-for-word Translation of the original Russian text, while the reference Translation is a more nuanced and cohesive version in English.

The main differences between the two are:

1. Word-choice: The machine Translation used ""Troubled"" as a direct Translation of ""беспокойные"" while the reference Translation used ""Uneasy"" to convey the same meaning in a more nuanced way.

2. Sentence structure: The machine Translation preserved the original sentence structure of the source text, resulting in a less-fluent and more awkward-sounding text. The reference Translation, on the other hand, restructured the text to make it flow better in English.

3. Punctuation: The machine Translation lacked proper punctuation, resulting in run-on sentences and lack of clarity. The reference Translation used proper punctuation to improve readability and flow.

Overall, the reference Translation is more accurate and nuanced, while the machine Translation is a literal and less nuanced word-for-word Translation. The reference Translation is more suitable for publication, while the machine Translation is only suitable for understanding the general meaning of the text.

The main difference is that the machine translation uses the word ""leavened"" which is not accurate in this context. ""Leavened"" refers to the process of making bread rise, and is not applicable here.

The reference translation uses the phrase ""they started drinking again"" while the machine translation uses the word ""leavened again"" leading to a different meaning.

The correct Russian-English translation for ""И прежде, чем три раза успел прокричать петух, заново заквасили."" should be ""and before the rooster had time to crow three times, they started making liquor/moonshine again "" as per the reference.

This is a common difference between Russian and English, as Russian often uses the present tense for formal or official statements.
3. Slight word choice: The reference and the machine-generated versions use slightly different word orders, but the overall meaning remains the same.

Overall, the machine-generated and reference versions of the text convey the same meaning, and the minor variations in wording and punctuation do not significantly impact the meaning. Therefore, the quality of the Russian-to-English translation is good. However, it is essential to consider the context and purpose of the text to ensure that the subtle differences between the original and the target language are appropriately addressed.

 I would be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Russian-English translation for the given text.

First, let's look at the source text in Russian:
""Маньяк Андрей Чикатило:""

Now, let's compare the machine-generated and reference translations in English:

Machine Translation: ""Maniac Andrei Chikatilo:""

Reference Translation: ""Maniac Andrei Chikatilo:""

In this particular instance, the machine-generated and reference translations are identical, so there is no difference to analyze.

However, it is important to note that this is a simple, proper noun phrase, and evaluating the quality of machine-generated vs. reference human-generated text for a more extended or complex text would be more appropriate to assess the overall performance of the system.

Nevertheless, it is good to see that the simple, direct noun-noun combination was translated accurately in this specific instance.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the general meaning of the Russian source text, which expresses some level of surprise or disbelief at the idea of encroaching on someone else's territory.

However, the machine-generated version differs slightly in wording from the reference version, which is a more literal and word-for-word translation of the original.

Specific differences include:

1. Use of contractions: The reference version uses the colloquial ""There just"" while the machine version renders it as ""Well, just"".
2. Punctuation: The reference version ends with an ellipsis, indicating a trailing-off or incomplete thought, while the machine version does not.

Overall, the machine-generated version is understandable and conveys the meaning of the original, but it may not be as nuanced or faithful to the original as the reference version. Additionally, the slight variations in wording and punctuation could potentially impact the tone or meaning of the text.

The machine translation uses the continuous tense ""is suspected of having"" while the reference translation uses the simple tense ""is suspected of having."" The continuous tense implies that the suspicion is ongoing or continuous, whereas the simple tense simply states that a suspicion exists. In this context, both tenses can be appropriate, depending on the intended meaning.

Additionally, the machine translation inserts the article ""a"". ""a different sexual orientation"" while the reference text does not use an article ""different sexual orientation"". In this context, both are grammatically correct, but omitting the article slightly modifies the meaning. Using the indefinite article implies that the speaker assumes that the person about whom they are speaking might have a sexual orientation that is different from what is traditionally expected, whereas omitting the article implies that the person's sexual orientation differs from what is traditionally expected, but does not specify whether the difference is known or unknown to the speaker.

Overall, the machine and reference translations convey the same meaning, but the word choices slightly alter the tone and emphasis of the sentence.

The machine Translation is: ""He will drink well, he will remember well.""

The reference Translation is: ""If you celebrate well, you will remember this well.""

The difference between the machine Translation and the reference Translation is that the machine Translation uses third-person singular verb forms for ""drink"" and ""remember,"" while the reference Translation uses a first-person plural verb form for ""celebrate.""

 The source text in Russian is ""На дваче вот нельзя,"" and the reference translation is ""You can't do that on Dvach.""

The machine-generated English translation, ""You can't really do that,"" differs from the reference version in two significant ways.

1. Specificity: The reference version specifies a particular platform, ""Dvach,"" whereas the machine-generated text is more general and vague.
2. Tone: The reference version has a conversational and slightly humorous tone, as if addressing someone who made a mistake or a faux pas. The machine-generated text lacks this nuance and sounds more straightforward.

To improve the quality of the Russian-to-English translation. It is essential to consider the source's context and the intended meaning. In this case, the specific reference to the ""Dvach"" platform suggests that the original statement was made within the context of that platform. Therefore, the more specific and context-appropriate version should be used.

Moreover, the use of contractions, as in the reference version, can help achieve a more conversational and light-hearted tone. Therefore, the improved version of the Russian-to-English text should be:

""You can't do that on Dvach.""

However, this phrase is commonly used to mean ""you should judge someone by their actions, not their looks or appearance alone.""

The machine translation provided. ""The head is not ironed for being hands-free (for not being smaller)"" is not an accurate or coherent rendering of the original text.

It's important to note that the process of Translation involves not just rendering words and phrases from one language to another, but also conveying the meaning, tone, and cultural context of the original. In this case, the source material contains an idiom that is specific to the Russian language, and the reference Translation does not fully convey the meaning of the original.

The reference English version correctly catches the nuance of the Russian and states ""The deck is being bizarre[-ly] shuffled"" in the passive, indicating that the action is happening to the subject (the card deck/s) and that the manner of the action is ""bizarre-ly/strangely/odd-ly"".

The machine's English version, ""Bizarre-ly shuffling the deck..."", differs slightly in meaning. The lack of an auxilliary verb ""is being"" and the word ""the"" in ""the deck"" implies a more active, agent-driven action, as if the ""bizarre-ness"" is the entity doing the action, and the ""deck"" is the object of the action.

2. Word-choice and style:
* The reference has used the term ""speedcubers"" to refer to people who are skilled in solving twisty puzzles quickly, while the machine has used ""spidkuberi"" (a direct translation of ""speedcubers"" in Russian, but not commonly used in everyday language in this context in the target language, which can lead to confusion for the target audience.
* The reference has used the word ""CubingTime"" to refer to the event, while the machine has used ""Cubingtime"" (a more common and widely used spelling in the target language for this type of event, which is more appropriate for the target audience.

3. Sentence structure and gramatical correctess:
* The reference has used a question form to ask if there are any ""speedcubers"" in the community, while the machine has used a statement with a question intonation.

Overall, the reference has used more appropriate and target-specific language, and the sentence structure is more in line with the target language, making it more accessible and clear for the target audience. The machine's version, on the other hand, lacked the target-specific language and sentence structure, making it less accessible and clear for the target audience.

 Both the machine and reference translation are very close in meaning to the original Russian source text. However, there is a subtle but important difference.

The Russian phrase ""для меня"" in the original sentence is not just asking for ""anyone"" to write a third paragraph, but specifically asking for someone to write it ""for me/for my benefit/on my behalf/etc."" This nuance is captured in the reference translation with the addition of the word ""for me"" at the end, but it is missing in the machine-generated version.

Therefore. the reference and the original sentence convey slightly different meanings, with the reference implying that the person asking prefers to have someone write the third paragraph for them, whereas the machine-generated one sounds more as if anyone can write a third paragraph, regardless of whether it is for the original author or not.

Overall, the difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is subtle but not insignificant, and it highlights the importance of considering the context and nuances of language when performing a high-quality, accurate, and nuanced translation.

The main difference between the machine and reference translations is that the reference version conveys a proverbial meaning, suggesting that things or people may not be what they initially appear to be. In contrast. the machine-generated version merely describes the physical environment of a quiet and apparently pleasant marsh or swamp.

To evaluate the quality of the Russian-to-English translation, it is essential to consider the meaning and cultural context of the original language. In this case, the reference version successfully conveys the underlying meaning, while the machine-generated one falls short. Therefore, the quality of the machine-generated version is lower, and it is crucial to consider the context and cultural nuances to produce a more nuanced and accurate version.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original Russian source text and convey the same meaning in English. However, there is a subtle but important difference between the two English translations.

The word ""вот"" in the original Russian source is often used to add emphasis or draw attention to what follows. In this case, the word ""вот"" emphasizes the idea of ""here it is, this is it, and here is what follows next: the second turn of the transformation.""

The reference English text includes the word ""here"" to convey the emphasis of the original word ""вот"" in the Russian text. However, the machine-generated English version lacks this important detail, and simply says ""This is the second turn of the transformation.""

While the meaning of the sentence is still clear in the machine-generated text, including the word ""here"" in the English version would improve the fluency and readability of the text, and convey the intended meaning of the original text more accurately.

Therefore, a more accurate and nuanced English version of the original text, taking the meaning and emphasis of the word ""вот"" into account, might be:

""Here is the second turn of the transformation.""

In summary, the main difference between the reference and the machine-generated English text is the lack of the word ""here"" in the latter, which slightly diminishes the emphasis and clarity of the meaning compared to the reference and the original text.

However, the machine-generated translation differs slightly in wording and structure from the reference version. The reference version is a more literal translation of the original Russian, with the same word order and phrasing as the source. The machine-generated version, on the other hand, rephrases the original slightly to make it sound more natural in English, with a different word choice and sentence structure.

Overall, the machine-generated version is understandable and conveys the intended meaning, but it may sound slightly less fluent or idiomatic to a native English reader compared to the reference version. Additionally, the reference version preserving the original phrasing may be preferred for literal translation purposes.

However, it's important to note that this is a relatively straightforward translation, involving common words and a clear subject.

The machine-generated translation ""Lamb and lamb are one tribe"". However, is not quite accurate. A closer inspection reveals that the subject of the original sentence contains two different animals: a lamb and a ram.

A more accurate machine-generated or human-generated,. Translation would be ""A lamb and a ram are of the same tribe"" or ""A lamb and a ram belong to the same tribe.""

The reference-generated, ""The lamb and the ram are one tribe,"" is also accurate, as it conveys the same meaning as the original Russian sentence.

In summary, the machine-generated, ""Lamb and lamb are one tribe"" is inaccurate as it implies that the subject is the same animal (lamb) repeated twice, rather than two different animals belonging to the same tribe. A more accurate machine-generated or a professional human-generated, ""A lamb and a ram are of the same tribe"" or ""A lamb and a ram belong to the same tribe"" is recommended.

The machine Translation is: ""Full of jokes, the wolf told the trap, let go of the paw.""

The reference Translation is: ""When it starts hurting, it's no longer funny.""

The main difference between the machine Translation and the reference Translation is that the machine Translation takes a literal and loose interpretation of the original text, while the reference Translation conveys the intended meaning behind the original text.

The literal meaning of the original Russian phrase ""Полно шутить, сказал волк капкану, отпусти лапу-то"" can be broken down as: ""joking around, said the wolf to the trap, release the paw-it.""

However, the reference Translation conveys the meaning that the situation is no laughing matter and it is time to stop joking and be serious, which is the intended meaning behind the original text.

The reference Translation is more accurate in capturing the tone and meaning of the original text, while the machine Translation is a word-for-word interpretation that misses the point.

Overall, the reference Translation is a more nuanced and accurate reflection of the intended meaning of the original text, and the machine Translation falls short in capturing the tone and nuance of the original.

 The machine translation ""Kissing Hank"" is different from the reference translation ""Kissing Hank's ass.""

The word ""целование"" in the source text can be translated as ""kissing"" or ""caressing"" in English, but in this context, it is clear that the intended meaning is closer to ""kissing (someone's) ass/behind/bottom part of the body/anus region of a male person named Hank/Henk/Hans/Henck, depending on the language variation of the name, in an affectionate or friendly manner, or as a gesture of admiration or respect, or sarcastically or derisively, depending on the context and the relationship between the people involved.

The reference English text reflects the more complete and accurate meaning of the original text, as it includes the word ""ass/behind/bottom part of the body/anus region of a male person named Hank/Henk/Hans/Henck"" to specify the location of the ""kissing/caressing/favor-granting/praising/flattering/pandering/bending-over-backwards-ing"" action.

The machine-generated English text, ""Kissing Hank,"" is less clear and less specific, as it only includes the name of the person being referred to, but not the location of the ""kissing/caressing/favor-granting/praising/flattering/pandering/bending-over-backwards-ing"" action.

Therefore, the reference English text is more complete and accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text, and the machine-generated text is less clear and less specific.

To improve the quality of the Russian-to-English text-to-speech system, the system should be able to recognize the specific meaning of the word ""целование"" in this particular context, and generate the appropriate English equivalent, including the word ""ass/behind/bottom part of the body/anus region of a male person named Hank/Henk/Hans/Henck"" to specify the location of the ""kissing/caressing/favor-granting/praising/flattering/pandering/bending-over-backwards-ing"" action.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, but there are some differences in how they express it.

The source text states that ""oplatа"" is about 20 ""rubleв,"" which is a colloquial or informal way of saying ""rubles"" in Russian. The number 20 and the word ""minutes"" follow ""rubles"" in the original Russian, but the machine-generated text separates them with punctuation, which slightly alters the meaning.

The reference text correctly renders the original by stating ""The pay is about 20 rubles every 60 minutes."" This conveys the same meaning as the original while maintaining the grammatical correctness and fluency of English.

In contrast, the machine-generated version separates the number 20 and ""rubles"" with punctuation, making it sound as if 20 separate payments of one ruble are made every 60 minutes.

Overall. the reference version is more accurate and natural-sounding in expressing the meaning of the original.

 The machine translation ""Thank God, and a piece of fat"" is different from the reference translation ""Glory to God, and a piece of fat to Pop.""

The main difference is that the machine translation has mistranslated ""Богу слава"" which should be ""Glory to God"" in English, not ""Thank God."" Additionally, the phrase ""а попу кусок сала"" should be translated as ""and a piece of fat to Pop"" rather than just ""a piece of fat.""

Here's a more accurate and nuanced breakdown of the differences:

1. ""Богу слава"" is a Russian phrase that literally means ""glory to God"" in English. However, the machine translation has translated it as ""Thank God"" - this is not an entirely incorrect translation, but it lacks the nuance and cultural significance of the original phrase.
2. The reference translation includes the word ""Pop,"" which is a colloquial and affectionate way to refer to a father or grandfather. The machine translation omits this word, and simply says ""a piece of fat"" without specifying who it is intended for.
3. The reference translation also has a more conversational and idiomatic tone, with the phrase ""a piece of fat to Pop"" being a common way to express affection and goodwill towards someone in Russian. The machine translation is more literal and lacks this conversational tone.

In summary. the reference and machine-generated translations differ in the way the original phrase ""Богу слава"" is translated, the inclusion of the word ""Pop"" in the reference, and the overall conversational and culturally-specific tone of the reference. A more accurate and nuanced machine-generated version might be ""Glory to God, and a piece of fat for you, Dad/Pop.""

The reference text also repeats the "")"" symbol three times, while the source material has it only once.

The machine-generated text is missing the additional ""there"" and the extra "")"" symbols, and it is not as close to the reference as it should be.

Therefore, the quality of the Russian-to-English machine-generated text is not satisfactory, and it should be improved to include the missing words and punctuation.

 Both the machine and reference translations are very close in this case, and the difference is quite minor. The only difference is in the use of punctuation. In the reference translation, there is an em dash (—) used to separate the two independent clauses, while in the machine translation, a period is used.

When comparing the two, it is clear that the reference version is using an em dash to emphasize the connection between the two actions (making cool logos and using only a browser) and to make the sentence sound more engaging. The machine version, on the other hand, separates the clauses with a period, making the sentence sound more straightforward.

Overall, the machine's performance in this case is quite accurate, and the meaning of the original text is preserved. However, the reference version's use of the em dash adds a nuance of emphasis and connection, which slightly enhances the fluency and readability of the text. Therefore, the reference version is a better choice in this case.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close in meaning to the original Russian source text. However, there is a subtle but important difference between the two English translations.

The machine translation uses the present tense ""NASA no longer needs Roscosmos services,"" which implies that NASA has made a decision about Roscosmos services in the past and the situation remains the same in the present.

On the other hand, the reference manual explicitly confirms that the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) no longer provides the necessary services to NASA in the present tense, ""NASA no longer needs Roscosmos services.""

Therefore, the reference manual is more accurate in reflecting the meaning of the original Russian sentence, as it confirms the current situation, while the machine-generated version only implies it.

Overall, the difference between the two English versions is minor, but it is important to note that the reference manual is more precise and accurate in this case.

However, the machine-generated version contains some minor errors. The verb ""plow"" should be in the past tense to maintain consistency with the rest of the sentence, as in the reference version: ""Two plowed, and seven waved their hands (around).""

Upon closer examination. however, there is a subtle difference between the machine and reference translations. The machine version translates ""рассказы"" (raskazy), which means ""stories"" or ""tales,"" as ""the stories of"" in English. The reference version simply has ""stories"" without the preposition ""of.""

While the meaning is not significantly altered, the reference version is more concise and idiomatic in English. The use of ""the"" in the reference version implies a specific set of stories, while the lack of an article in the machine version implies a more general sense.

Overall, the machine version is understandable and conveys the intended meaning, but the reference version is more idiomatic and concise, making it a better reflection of the original Russian.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very similar and accurately convey the meaning of the source text. However, there is a subtle difference in the way they translate the name of the film ""Собачье сердце.""

The machine translation translates the film title as ""Dog's Heart,"" while the reference translation translates it as ""Dog's Soul."" The difference is minor, but it is important to note that the word ""сердце"" in Russian can be translated both as ""heart"" and ""soul,"" depending on the context. In this case, the film's title is a metaphor for the main character's compassion and empathy, rather than a literal reference to a heart, so ""soul"" might be a more appropriate translation.

Overall,. the machine-generated translation is accurate, but the reference-human-generated-translation conveys the meaning of the original text slightly better.

 The machine translation ""The first guy is in the village and the village is two yards away"" is different from the reference translation ""The first guy in the village, and the village is just two houses.""

The inaccuracy in the machine-generated translation likely arises from misunderstanding of the original Russian phrase ""деревня в два dvora"", which means ""the village of two houses/homesteads"" or ""the village consisting of two houses/homesteads"". The word ""derevnia"" (деревня) in Russian refers to a small rural settlement, and ""dvor"" (two in this context) is a term used to denote a homestead or a household with its own yard, buildings, etc.

Therefore, the reference correctly interprets the meaning of the original text, and the machine-generated version is inaccurate. The difference is significant, as the reference accurately conveys the small size of the village, while the machine-generated version suggests that the village is physically located two ""yards"" or ""dvors"" away.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original Russian source text, which is ""Трэш в церкви / У меня моральная травма"". The phrase ""Трэш в церкви"" literally translates to ""Trash in church"" in English.

However, the second part of the sentence, ""У меня моральная травма,"" presents a challenge for translation, as it is a culturally-specific idiom. The Russian phrase ""У меня моральная травма"" literally translates to ""I have a moral trauma/injury/damage/harm/hurt/inconvenience/etc."" in English. However, the reference and machine translations render it simply as ""I have a moral trauma)"" with no explanation.

The reference and machine-generated versions both assume that the reader will understand the cultural reference. In this context, ""moral trauma"" is a slogan used by some Russians to express frustration or disappointment with the church, suggesting that the church is not living up to its values.

However, this meaning is not apparent in the literal, word-for-word rendering of the phrase. Therefore, a more nuanced and culturally-sensitive approach to the English translation is warranted.

A more accurate and culturally-sensitive English version of the phrase might be:

""Church hypocrisy/corruption/disappointment/etc. / I have a moral trauma)""

In this version, the meaning of the idiom is conveyed, and the cultural reference is made clear.

Overall, the machine and reference versions of the Russian-to-English text are technically correct, but lack the nuance and cultural sensitivity that a human interpreter can provide.

The source text literally says ""a commission such is, that the Church from this painful question does not run away."" The word ""такая"" (takaia) in the original text emphasizes the existence and importance of the commission, and the word ""от"" (ot) in the expression ""от этого вопроса"" (ot etogo voprosa) literally means ""from"" or ""about"" but can also convey the idea of avoiding or shying away from something.

The machine and reference translations both use the verb ""shy away from"" to convey the meaning of ""от"" (ot), but the reference translation emphasizes the Church's avoidance of the painful question by placing it at the end of the sentence, while the machine version emphasizes the Church's non-involvement by placing it at the beginning.

The reference version is therefore more accurate in capturing the tone and emphasis of the original, and it better conveys the idea that the Church is not addressing the painful question. A more literal and faithful rendering of the original text might be: ""A commission of this kind exists, so the Church doesn't run away from this painful question either.""

 in Translation

When evaluating the quality. of a Russian-English translation, it's important to compare the machine and reference translations to the original source text carefully.

In this particular case, the source text is ""не контролируется"" in Russian, which the machine has translated as ""not controlled"" in English.

The reference Translation provided is also ""not controlled"" in English, which is the same as the machine's output.

Therefore, in this case, the machine's output is equivalent to the reference, and the quality of the Russian-English Translation is accurate.

However, it's important to note that this is a relatively simple and straightforward example, and more challenging texts may require more sophisticated evaluation methods.

Overall, the key to evaluating the quality of a Translation is to compare it carefully to the source and reference texts, taking context and nuance into account.

580	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The source text in Russian is ""Держи на уме, коли есть на чём."" The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, which is a piece of advice to keep in mind the things one has or the available opportunities.

 The source text is in Russian, while both the machine and reference translations are in English.

The source text reads ""Визуализация мечтаний Артура Флека.""

The machine-generated translation ""Visualizing Arthur Fleck's Dreams"" is different from the reference ""Visualizing Arthur Fleck's dreams"" in the use of upper-case letters. In the reference, the possessive ""'s"" is written in lower-case, while the machine-generated version has it in upper-case.

The correct English rendering of the Russian text is ""Visualizing Arthur Fleck's dreams"" with the possessive ""'s"" in lower-case, as in the reference.

The difference is minor and does not significantly impact the meaning of the text, but it is important to maintain consistency in capitalization to ensure proper style and readability.

However, the machine and reference use slightly different grammatical structures in English.

The reference version is identical to the original Russian sentence, but with English words and grammar.

The machine version, on the other, is written in a more common and everyday English, with the intransitive verb ""hurt"" being used in the continuous form, ""they hurt, "" to indicate that the pain in the arms is continuous.

In summary, the main difference between the reference and the machine is the use of more everyday English in the machine, but the overall meaning of the sentence remains the same.

However, it's important to note that in more complex or nuanced texts. machine translation may not always be accurate or convey the intended meaning of the original text. In such cases, manual translation by a human translator who is a native speaker of the target language and has a deep understanding of the source language and culture is recommended.

 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation lies in the verb used to describe how the person is moving about at the festival. The machine translation uses ""walk around the festival in plaster, with crutches"" while the reference translation uses ""enjoy the festival in plaster, with crutches and no complaints.""

""Walk around the festival in plaster, with crutches"" implies that the person is physically moving with the aid of crutches, despite being in a cast.

""Enjoy the festival in plaster, with crutches and no complaints"" implies that the person is still able to enjoy the festival despite being in a cast and using crutches.

Overall, the reference Translation is more in line with the intent of the original sentence, as it emphasizes the ability of the individual to still enjoy the festival despite their injury, whereas the machine Translation only emphasizes the physical aspect of their ability to get about.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same overall meaning, which is that the stories being referred to are scarce in number but beautiful or charming in their expression, just like music.

However, there is a subtle difference in the wording used in each translation. In the machine-generated translation, the word ""they"" is used to refer to the stories, whereas in the reference translation, the implication is that the stories sound musical in their original language (Russian) and retain that quality in the English translation.

Therefore. the machine-generated version loses some of the nuance of the original Russian, whereas the reference version preserves it. Additionally, the reference version is slightly clearer about the comparison between the stories and music, phrasing it as ""chut' ne sozvuchki"" (hardly more than chatter) in the original Russian, whereas the machine-generated version simply says that the stories ""zvuchat, kak muzyka"" (sound like music).

Overall, while both versions are grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning, the reference version is more nuanced and precise in its wording.

 The source text in Russian, ""Просит убогий, а подаёшь Богу,"" can have different meanings depending on the context, but in this particular case, the reference and human translator have provided a more general and idiomatic interpretation, ""Everything is up to God.""

The machine-generated text, ""The poor ask, but you give to God,"" is a literal and word-for-word rendering of the original text, but it lacks the intended meaning and cultural nuance of the original.

The reference and the human-generated text convey the idea that the outcome or result of a situation is beyond human control and is left to a higher power, in this case, ""God"" in the broader sense of a higher authority.

The machine-generated text, on the other hand, suggests that the poor are asking for something, and the person or entity referred to in the sentence is giving it to ""God"" or a divine entity, which is not the intended meaning.

Therefore, the human-generated and reference text is more reflective of the intended meaning and nuance of the original text compared to the literal and word-for-word approach of the machine-generated text.

 Both the machine and reference translation render the source text in a similar way, with the same words and overall structure. However, there is a subtle difference in the meaning of the phrase ""three days in his shoes.""

In the original Russian text, ""три дня в лапти обувается"" literally means ""spends three days in his shoes."" Here, the word ""spends time"" is implied, but not explicitly stated. The reference and machine translations both convey the literal meaning of the phrase, but the reference omits the word ""in his shoes"" as it is already implied in the original.

Therefore. the machine and reference versions differ slightly in their degree of literalness, with the reference version being slightly more idiomatic. However, neither version is incorrect, and the subtle distinction in meaning may not be significant in many contexts.

 Both the machine and reference translation convey the same basic meaning as the source text, which is: ""It's not the trouble that has come into the yard, but rather the trouble that will come out of the yard.""

However, there is a subtle nuance in the reference and machine-generated translations that slightly alters the meaning.

The reference and source text both use the phrase ""на двор"" (na dvor), which means ""to the courtyard/yard of a building or house/garden/garden-plot/games field/grazing ground/farmstead, etc.""

The machine-generated version, however, incorrectly interprets ""двор"" (dvor) as ""dvor"" (which is a Russian name for a person or a place in some Slavic countries, but not in the context of the original sentence in question here).

The reference and machine-generated versions both correctly use the phrase ""со двора"" ( Iz dvorá), meaning ""from the courtyard/yard of a building or house/garden/grazing ground/farmstead, etc.""

Therefore, the reference and the original source convey the meaning of the text more accurately, as the machine-generated version contains an error in the interpretation of the word ""dvor"" (dvor).

The reference and machine-generated versions also differ slightly in the wording of the first part of the sentence.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very similar and convey the same meaning in English. However, there is a subtle difference in the way the word ""titushkov"" is translated.

The source text uses the Russian word ""титушки"" (titushki, pronounced ""tee-TOO-shki""), which is a colloquial term referring to individuals or groups who are hired. paid to cause disturbances or violence at protests or public events.

The machine translation translates ""титушки"" as ""the titushkov,"" while the reference

translation translates it simply as ""Titusha.""

While both translations convey the intended meaning, the reference

translation is more concise and uses a commonly accepted English term for such individuals, which is ""rent-a-thugs or hired thugs.""

Therefore, the reference

translation is more accurate and natural-sounding in English. However, the machine translation is not incorrect, and the meaning is still conveyed.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, which is a statement about Russian politics rather than a literal assessment of Russia's shape. However, there are some differences in wording and style.

The main difference is that the machine translation uses ""crooked"" to translate ""крива"" while the reference translation uses an exclamation mark to convey the same idea. ""Крива"" here is being used idiomatically to mean something like ""in a poor state"" or ""messy situation.""

The use of ""crippled"" could be seen as a somewhat more literal interpretation of the word, while the reference translation conveys the same meaning but in a more rhetorical and emphatic way.

Overall, the reference and machine translations convey the same meaning, but the reference version is slightly more nuanced and closer to idiomatic English.

The difference lies in the interpretation of the Russian word ""на"" (na) in the source text, which can be translated as ""on/in"" or ""at"" depending on the context. In the given context, it implies ""at the location of"" or ""in the area of.""

Therefore, the reference version is more complete, accurate, and natural-sounding compared to the machine-generated version.

 Both the machine and reference translations are accurate and convey the same meaning as the original Russian source text. The source text ""Я парень"" translates to ""I'm a guy"" in English, and the expression of interest ""мне интересно"" is conveyed as ""I'm interested"" in the target language.

However, the reference and machine-generated translations differ slightly in punctuation and capitalization. Specifically, the reference version has a period at the end of ""I'm a guy"" and no space after the comma in ""I'm interested"", whereas the machine-generated version has no period and has a space after the comma.

While this is a minor issue. It is important to note that consistency in punctuation and capitalization can improve the overall readability and fluency of the target text.

Therefore, I would evaluate the quality of the machine-generated Russian-to-English translation as good, but with room for improvement in terms of punctuation and consistency.

 The machine translation ""I am not afraid in Sergei Lazarev's performance"" is different from the reference translation ""I am not afraid performed by Sergei Lazarev.""

The main difference is that the machine translation includes the preposition ""in"" after ""afraid"" which is not present in the reference translation. In the reference translation, ""performed by Sergei Lazarev"" is an adjectival phrase modifying ""I am not afraid"" and does not require a preposition.

Additionally, the verb tense in the machine translation is inconsistent. The subject pronoun ""I"" is in the present tense, while the verb form of ""afraid"" is in the gerund, which is typically used for progressive or continuous actions. The reference translation correctly uses the past tense ""performed"" to indicate that the action is completed.

Overall. the machine translation is less clear and precise than the reference translation, and requires careful reading to understand the intended meaning.

However. it is important to note that the use of the term ""sex-slave"" or ""секс-рабыня"" in this context is not accurate and can be misleading. The original Russian text refers to the concept of ""sex slaves"" or ""секс-рабынь"" as allowed by Islam, but it is not referring to the actual practice of keeping sex slaves.

A more accurate and nuanced English translation would be: ""The imam of a mosque in Wales stated that Islam permits the possibility of having what is known as 'sex slaves'.""

In this case, the use of quotation marks or italics in the English translation is necessary to emphasize that the concept of ""sex slaves"" in Islam actually refers to a historical practice of having concubines or having slaves who were designated for sexual purposes, which was allowed during certain periods of Islamic history. However, the practice of keeping slaves or concubines is no longer allowed or practiced in modern Islamic societies. Therefore, the use of the phrase ""sex-slave"" or ""секс-рабыня"" in the English or Russian language respectively, is not an appropriate or accurate description of the concept in the context of the original statement.

The reference and machine translations share the same errors, as neither provides a correct English translation of the original Russian source.

One difference is in the phrase ""национальной системы творческого потенциала,"" by the source text, which the machine has translated as ""a national system of creativity."" The reference manual has kept the same wording, but in this context, the word ""creativity"" might not be the best choice. A more accurate and literal translation of ""национальной системы творческого потенциала"" is a ""national system for developing creative potential.""

Another slight discrepancy is in the wording of the third element of the list, ""укрепление роли государства и сотрудничества двух секторов — частного и государственного."" The machine has rendered this as ""strengthening the role of the state and the cooperation of the two private and public sectors."" The reference manual, on the other hand, has ""strengthen the role of the state and cooperation of the two sectors, private and public.""

The main difference is that the machine translation uses the present perfect tense (""writing"" on his Facebook page. In contrast. the reference translation uses the past tense (""wrote"" on his Facebook page). The use of the past tense in the reference

translation is more accurate, as the original Russian sentence uses the past tense (""писал"" на своей ФБ-странице).

Additionally, the reference translation includes quotation marks to indicate that the phrase ""on his Facebook page"" is a direct quote from the original sentence, whereas the machine

translation does not.

Overall, while both translations convey the main idea clearly, the reference

 In this case. both the machine and reference translations are identical and accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text indicates that Muslim female teachers are permitted to wear headscarves, and both translations reflect this accurately.

However, it's worth noting that the reference and machine translations use different words to refer to the ""headscarves"" in question. The reference text uses the term ""headscarves"" while the machine text uses ""headscarves"" as well. While the meaning of the term ""headscarf"" is clear in this context, it's possible that the original text used a different word to refer to the specific type of head covering worn by some Muslim women, such as a hijab or niqab.

In summary, the machine and reference texts accurately reflect the meaning of the original, but a careful evaluation of the specific words used in the target language (in this case, ""headscarf"" or ""head covering"") is necessary to ensure the most accurate and nuanced possible translation.

The machine and reference translations both provide the same meaning that the Levada-center, which is one of the major sociological services in Russia, will not be able to publish its poll results or surveys during or in advance of the elections.

However, the machine-generated version differs slightly in wording and style from the reference.

1. The word ""one"" is inserted in the machine-generated version, but it is not in the reference.
2. The verb ""smozhet"" (will be able to) is translated as ""will not be able to "" in the reference, but the machine-generated version has ""smostrel"" (smtrel) which is a more literal but less common form of the verb.

Overall, the meaning of the machine-generated and reference versions is the same, but the reference is more accurate and reads more naturally.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same overall meaning, but there are some differences in wording.

The main difference is in the treatment of proper nouns. In the source text. ""санкции"" refers to ""sanctions"" for which the subject is implied to be ""Russia's economy"" and ""удар"" refers to ""strike"" for which the subject is implied to be ""the USA/US"".

In the machine-generated text, the proper noun ""Russia's"" is used to modify ""economy"" and ""a US strike on Syria"" is used to refer to the implied ""strike by the US"".

In the reference-provided human-generated text, the proper noun ""Russia"" is used twice, once to modify ""sanctions"" and once to refer to the subject of the sentence, and ""a US strike on Syria"" is used to refer to the implied ""strike by the USA/US on Syria/Syria's"".

Overall, the machine-generated and reference-provided texts convey the same meaning, but the reference-provided version is more consistent in its use of proper noun references.

 The machine translation correctly captured the main idea of the source text, which is about Pavel Volya's thoughts on Insta-models in politics. However, there are a few differences when compared to the reference translation.

1. Articles: In English, the indefinite article ""a/an"" is used before singular, countable nouns, unless the noun is specific. In the source and reference text, ""Comedy club"" and ""Pavel Volya"" refer to specific entities, so the reference text includes the definite article ""The"" in ""The Comedy club"" and no article in ""Pavel Volya"". However, the machine translation omits the articles.

Corrected version: ""KameDI Club. Pavel Volya on Insta-models in politics. That's how we live...""

2. Word spacing: The reference text includes spaces after periods at the end of sentences, while the machine translation does not.

Corrected version: ""KameDI Club. Pavel Volya on Insta-models in politics. That's how we live...""

Overall. the machine-generated Russian-to-English translation is understandable and conveys the intended meaning. However, minor errors such as missing articles and improper spacing can impact the fluency and formality of the text.

 When comparing the machine and reference translations. The main difference is in the last part of the sentence. The reference. ""only the owl will be the one to hurt"" translates to ""только сова будет ранена"" in Russian. However, the machine's version says ""не сосне будет больно"" which is a literal but incorrect interpretation of the original text.

The source sentence is a Russian idiom, which literally means ""beat the owl against the pine tree/beating the owl with a pine tree/pitting the owl and the pine tree against each other "" and the meaning is that no matter what you do, you can't harm the pine tree, meaning that no matter what you do, you can't make something bad come from something good.

The reference version correctly conveys the meaning of the original sentence, but the machine's one is a literal and incorrect interpretation of the original.

The source and reference version use a specific idiom, which is not a common one, and the machine did not recognize it, and translated it literally, which resulted in a less accurate and less meaningful version.

It is important to note that, in this case, the reference is more idiomatic and the machine is literal.

It is also important to note that the reference is more idiomatic and the machine is literal, and the reference is more accurate in this context.

In summary, the main issue with the machine's version is that it is a literal and incorrect interpretation of the original text, while the reference correctly conveys the meaning of the original sentence.

 In the given source text. ""Бил, бил — едва вырвался"", the verb ""бил"" is used in a reflexive manner, which conveys the meaning of ""strenuously trying to get out of a difficult situation or fighting hard"".

The machine Translation ""Bit, bit, barely broke out"" conveys the meaning of struggling to get out but lack the nuance of the original text that the subject is fighting or trying very hard.

The reference Translation, ""He beat and beat and could hardly escape"" is a more accurate representation of the original text. The verb beat is used here in a more intransitive sense, meaning to struggle, and the adverb hardly is used to convey the difficulty of the action.

Overall, the reference Translation is more nuanced and a more accurate reflection of the meaning of the original. The machine Translation, while conveying the main idea, lack the subtle nuances of the reference.

 In this case, both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, and there are no glaring errors in the machine-generated version. However, there are some subtle differences in how the two translations convey the original Russian text.

One difference is that the word ""gymnasium"" in the machine-generated version might be slightly confusing to English-speaking readers, as it usually refers to a type of school in the United States. In the reference version, the word ""gymnasium"" is kept in its original form, which may be less familiar to some readers but is more faithful to the original text.

Another possible issue is that the word ""Tol"" in the original text is translated differently in the two versions. The reference version renders it simply as ""the Torah,"" while the machine-generated one renders it as ""a Torah"" (with the indefinite article ""a"" added). The reference version is more precise, as the word ""the"" implies that the specific Torah scroll in question is already known to the reader.

Overall, the machine-generated version is not inaccurate, but the reference version is more precise and faithful to the original.

 Both the machine and reference translations are very close in this case, and the meaning is preserved in both. However, there are slight differences in the presentation of names.

In the original Russian text, the name ""Джулиани"" (Giuliani) is transliterated from the Russian alphabet using latin letters as ""Drupalni"". In the machine-generated English translation, it is anglicized as ""Giuliani"" which is the common anglicized form of the name.

The reference human-made English translation also follows the convention of using the common English version of the name, ""Giuliani"" in this case.

Therefore, the primary difference between the machine and reference translations is the convention used for rendering the name ""Джулиани"" in the target English text. The difference is minor and does not significantly impact the meaning of the text.

The reference version appears to be conveying frustration or anger, as indicated by the word ""damn"" and the emphasis on ""no"" in the form of ""go and mix everything with shit"". The machine version lacks this emphasis and emotional impact, and simply states ""no, mix everything with shit"".

Overall, the reference version conveys a more emotional and personal message, while the machine version is more straightforward and literal. Additionally, the reference version adds the word ""go and"" to the sentence, indicating a more direct and imperious command, as opposed to the simple statement of the machine version.

The reference translation reads ""Or you can listen online on our website,"" which is more complete and clear in indicating that listening to the content is an option for the user. The machine-generated version is slightly less clear in this regard, as it could be interpreted as a statement about the website's capabilities, rather than an invitation to the user to listen to content.

Overall, the machine-generated version conveys the main idea of the original Russian text, but it lacks the same level of precision and nuance as the reference version. In a professional setting, it is important to ensure that translations convey the intended meaning as accurately and clearly as possible, so the reference version would be the preferred one in this case.

The difference between the machine and reference Translation is that the machine version lacks the auxiliary verb ""will"" that is present in the reference version. The auxiliary verb ""will"" is used in English to express future tense, and it is implied in the Russian version by the verb form ""узнают"" (uznaut, which means ""they learn/find out/get to know"" in the future tense, as indicated by the verb ending ""-ут""). Therefore, the correct and complete version of the machine's response, which conveys the same meaning as the reference, is: ""will get to know what their children are like"" or ""will learn what their children are like"".

In the source and reference text, the article ""A"" is not present, whereas in the machine-generated text, the article is included.

In terms of fluency and readability, the reference and machine-generated text are both understandable and convey the intended meaning clearly. However, the reference text is a more accurate and faithful representation of the original source.

In terms of grammatical correctness, the reference and machine-generated text both use correct grammatical structures and do not contain any major errors.

In summary, the main difference between the reference and machine-generated text is the inclusion of the article ""A"" in the machine-generated version.

 The source text appears to be in Russian, while the machine and reference translations are in English.

Upon comparison. the machine and reference translations seem to be almost identical, conveying the same meaning as the source text.

However, there are a few minor differences in wording and sentence structure. For example, in the first sentence, the machine version uses ""I"" rather than ""me"" as in the reference, and in the second-to-last sentence, the reference omits the word ""them"" which is present in the machine version.

Overall, the two English texts seem to be conveying the same meaning, with the reference version being slightly more concise and natural-sounding. The minor differences in wording and phrasing likely result from differences in the automated vs. manual approaches to the task.

When evaluating the quality of the machine-generated text, it's important to consider factors such as fluency, accuracy, and naturalness. In this case, the machine-generated version is mostly accurate, but it could be improved in terms of fluency and naturalness. However, the differences between the machine and reference versions are relatively minor, and overall, the quality of the machine-generated version is decent.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey a literal meaning of the Russian phrase ""Рука руку моет, и обе белы живут."" However, neither of them seems to be a coherent or meaningful sentence in English.

Upon closer examination, it appears that the source phrase contains a grammatical error in Russian, as the subject and verb should agree in gender. A more accurate and correct version of the phrase should be ""Рука рука моет, и обе белые живут.""

Assuming the intended meaning of the corrected phrase, a more accurate and meaningful English equivalent of the corrected Russian phrase ""Рука рука моет, и обе белые живут"" could be ""One hand washes, and both whites live.""

However, it is still unclear what exactly ""белые"" refers to in the given context, as it can be translated as either ""whites/white things/white substances/whitening agents/whitening cream, etc.""

Therefore, it is challenging to evaluate the differences in meaning and nuances of the given source, reference, and machine-generated English phrases. Nevertheless, it is evident that the reference and the machine-generated English phrases lack clarity and specificity, and thus, a more detailed and precise version of the intended meaning of the original phrase is needed to make a more informed comparison.

The machine translation uses the phrase ""climb into new ones,"" which could be interpreted in several ways and may not accurately reflect the original Russian phrase ""залезают в новыears,"" which means ""get into new"" (in the context of debt or obligations).

The reference translation uses the more idiomatic expression ""get into new debt"" to convey the same idea, which is clearer and more accurate in this context.

Overall, while both translations are understandable, the reference translation is more precise and closely aligned with the original Russian.

 The difference between the machine and reference translations lies in the implication of the Russian idiom ""Сколько волка ни корми — он всё в лес смотрит.""

The source text is using a Russian idiom, which literally translates to ""No matter how much the wolf you feed, but he looks into the forest."" The meaning of this idiom is closer to ""You can give the wolf the best food, but he would still long for the forest/woods/great outdoors/wild.""

The reference/human translation accurately conveys the meaning of the idiom, emphasizing the idea that the wolf would still prefer the outdoors, regardless of being well-fed.

The machine-generated text, however, is a more literal and word-for-word translation, which loses the original meaning and the intended emphasis of the metaphor. The phrase ""looks out into the forest"" is not an incorrect or inappropriate literal rendering, but it lacks the depth and nuance of the reference/human-generated version.

In summary, the primary difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the interpretation and conveying the meaning of the underlying idiom, which is essential to fully grasp the intended meaning of the original text.

However, there is a difference in punctuation. The reference translation ends the sentence at a comma, while the machine-generated version correctly finishes it with a period.

The primary difference between the reference and the machine-generated version lies in the nuanced meaning of the word ""advise"" in the comment section. The reference text uses the verb ""will be happy to advise you"" in the comments, suggesting a more active role in providing suggestions. In contrast, the machine-generated version uses the verb ""I will be happy to advise you in the comments"" which implies that the author might not actively seek out other resources but would consider suggestions if brought up.

In this case, the reference version might be more appropriate since it implies a more proactive approach to seeking out other resources. Nevertheless, the difference in meaning between the reference and the machine-generated text is subtle, and both convey the core message of the author's openness to suggestions.

The machine-generated English translation ""Buy a cat in a bag"" is a literal interpretation of the words, but it is not an accurate reflection of the meaning of the original phrase.

Therefore, the difference in the two English versions is that the reference version conveys the intended meaning of the original, while the machine-generated one is a literal but incorrect interpretation.

## Expert Opinion

I am an assistant language model and I can provide you with information and analysis based on the data given.

In this specific case, the difference in the two English versions is significant. The reference English version ""Buy a pig in a poke"" is an idiom that conveys the meaning of the original phrase, which is to make a deceptive or underhanded sale. The literal interpretation of the Russian words, ""Buy a cat in a bag,"" is not an accurate reflection of the meaning of the original.

The inaccuracy of the machine-generated English version highlights the importance of considering the meaning and cultural nuances of the original language, and not just the literal meaning of the words.

In conclusion, the reference English version is a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the meaning of the original, and therefore, it is a better quality version.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very similar in this case, and they both convey the same general meaning as the source text. However. there is a subtle difference in how they interpret the Russian phrase ""благодати"" which was translated as ""grace"" in both translations.

In the context of the original Russian text, ""благодати"" refers to a spiritual concept in Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which is often translated as ""grace"" in English. However, the use of the word ""grace"" in the reference and machine translation might not fully convey the original meaning to English-speaking audiences who may not be familiar with the spiritual connotations of the word.

A more appropriate translation of ""благодати"" might be ""divine favor"" or ""spiritual blessings"" to better reflect the original meaning of the term and avoid confusion.

Therefore, a more nuanced and culturally sensitive English version of the original text might be:

The church is a commercial product, a business selling spiritual blessings.

In summary, the machine and reference-based English versions of the text convey the same meaning, but a more nuanced and culturally sensitive approach could improve the accuracy of the English text.

1. Article Usage: The machine and reference translations both use the article ""the"" with ""entire history"" and ""post-communist Russia,"" but the source only has the article with ""post-communist Russia.""
2. Word Order: The word order differs slightly between the two translations. The reference. translation follows the original text more closely, while the machine version rearranges the sentence for better fluency in English.
3. Conjunction vs. Phrase: The reference version uses the phrase ""that is to say"" to clarify the meaning, while the machine version simply repeats the subject with ""that is.""

Overall, the machine-generated version is readable and understandable, but the reference version is more faithful to the original and maintains the nuances of the original wording. The reference version also avoids using the continuous tense ""were extracted"" in favor of the more appropriate ""have been mined/extracted"" to maintain consistency with the 25-year time frame mentioned earlier.

Therefore, the quality evaluation of the machine Translation, when compared to the reference Translation, would be ""Good"" or ""High Quality"" as the machine has accurately translated the given text.

However, it is important to note that the similarity in this particular case is due to the fact that the text is quite straightforward and contains common words. In other cases, the complexity of the text and the specificity of the language can significantly affect the quality of the Translation.

In the machine. translation, the phrase ""its liquidation in 1991"" is placed at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it appears in the middle of the sentence.

While both translations convey the same meaning. The reference version maintains the same word order as the original Russian, resulting in a more literal and accurate representation of the original text. In contrast, the machine-generated text rearranges the sentence for fluency in English, potentially sacrificing some of the original structure.

In the machine-generated translation, the verb ""cares"" is used, which implies an ongoing concern or interest in important things. In contrast, the reference-generated version uses the past tense ""cared,"" suggesting that the president's concern for important things is a historical fact or a one-time occurrence.

Without knowing the context. We can't say for sure which version is more accurate. However, if the source text implies that the president is consistently or repeatedly concerned with ""important things,"" the machine-generated version is more accurate.

2. Word-choice: The word ""naschet"" in the original text is correctly translated as ""about"" in the reference version, but the machine-generated one has ""about information"" switched to ""about the information"" which is grammatically correct but sounds slightly more verbose.

3. Style: The reference version has exclamation points at the end of both sentences, giving it a more dramatic and empathic tone. The machine-generated one lacks this stylistic element, making it sound slightly less impactful.

 In this case. both the machine and reference translations are accurate and produce the same result. The Russian phrase ""РПЦ освободят от обязанности отчитываться перед властями о своих финансах"" literally means ""ROC will be relieved of the obligation to report to the authorities about its finances.""

The term ""РПЦ"" refers to the Russian Orthodox Church, and the phrase ""отчитываться перед властяami о своих финансах"" refers to the requirement to report one's finances to the authorities.

Therefore, the two phrases convey the same meaning, and the machine and reference versions of the text can be considered equivalent.

However, it is important to note that the accuracy of a machine or reference-level human-generated Russian-to-English or any other language-to-language text depends on the context and the specific requirements of the task.

In some cases, nuances and subtleties of meaning can be missed or misinterpreted by a machine, and a professional human-generated version is necessary to ensure the highest level of accuracy.

In the machine translation, the word ""браку"" is translated as ""marriage"" and is used in the plural form, resulting in the phrase ""the whole marriage is happy."" In contrast, the reference translation translates ""браку"" as ""marriage"" and uses it in the singular form, resulting in the phrase ""the whole marriage is happy.""

While both translations convey the same meaning. The reference version is more precise and accurate, as the original text uses the singular form of the word. Therefore, the reference version is better than the machine-generated one.

* же (an emphasis particle in Russian, which emphasizes the word before it, in this case, ""большинство"")
* настроено (a slang expression meaning ""are in the mood"" or ""are feeling a certain way"")
* иначе (differently)

A more literal, word-for-word breakdown of the Russian sentence is: ""The-majority indeed differently.""

The machine-generated English translation, ""Most are not,"" is quite a bit off the mark. The reference English text, ""The majority have a different mindset,"" is more accurate, as it conveys the meaning of the original text, which is that the majority of people have a different attitude or perspective.

The primary issue with the machine-generated text is that it fails to convey the meaning of the original, and instead, it provides a literal, word-for-word, and inaccurate rendering of the original. The reference English version, on the other hand, is a faithful and accurate representation of the meaning of the original.

Moreover, the reference English version is more culturally and linguistically appropriate for the target English-reading audience, as it conveys the meaning of the original using common English idioms and expressions.

In summary, the reference English version is a more accurate and culturally relevant representation of the meaning of the original, and it is a better fit for the target English-reading audience.

 Without the actual machine translation and reference translation, it is difficult to make a precise comparison. However, I can point. out some general differences that you may look for when evaluating a Russian-English translation:

1. Faithfulness to the original text: Compare how closely the machine or human translation follows the original Russian text in terms of meaning, style, and tone.
2. Fluency: Check if the target language (English) flows naturally and if the grammar, punctuation, and word choice are correct.
3. Coherence: Ensure that the different parts of the text fit together well and make sense as a whole.
4. Cultural references: Check if the text makes sense in a cultural and historical context.
5. Consistency: Ensure that the same words and phrases are consistently translated throughout the text.
6. Fidelity to the original meaning: Ensure that the meaning of the original text is accurately conveyed in the target language.

In the case of the text ""Финансовая река веры:"", the reference and machine-generated English versions should be compared to evaluate the quality of the latter. The reference version can serve as a standard for determining the accuracy and fluency of the machine-generated text. Additionally, the specific differences between the reference and the machine-generated text, such as word choices, grammatical errors, or omissions, can be analyzed to assess the overall quality of the machine-generated version.

 The source text in Russian, ""На кривой суд образца нет,"" was translated into English by a machine as ""There is no pattern on the curve."" However, the reference translation provided is ""There is no pattern for the bad trial.""

The difference between the machine and reference translation lies in the interpretation of the word ""образца"" in the source text. The word ""образца"" can be translated as ""sample,"" ""model/pattern/example to follow/imitation of,"" "" Grade A/exemplary,"" or ""on trial/in court.""

In this case, the reference provided translates ""образца"" as ""bad trial/in court/on trial"" to fit the context.

However, the machine's literal interpretation of ""образца"" as ""pattern/model/example to follow/imitation of "" does not fit the context, and thus the inaccurate rendering of the meaning of the original text.

Therefore, the machine's English rendering of the given text is less accurate and less fitting to the reference provided.

Furthermore, the reference text is more idiomatic and better reflects the meaning of the original text.

In conclusion, the reference text is more accurate and fitting to the original text, and the machine's literal interpretation is less accurate and less fitting to the reference provided.

In the reference translation, a pair of commas is used after ""By October 2019,"" while in the machine-generated version, there is no punctuation after the year.

The minor difference in punctuation style is unlikely to cause any confusion or impact the overall meaning of the sentence. However, it is essential to maintain consistency in punctuation throughout a written piece to ensure clarity and professionalism.

In summary.

1. The primary elements of the sentence, including the volume of the loans and the time frame, are translated accurately in both versions.
2. The slight discrepancy in the use of punctuation, specifically the placement of commas, is the only notable difference between the machine and reference versions.

The quality of the machine-generated Russian-to-English translation is good, and the minor punctuation difference should not significantly impact the overall meaning of the text. However, maintaining consistency in punctuation throughout the text is essential for professional writing.

 Both the machine and reference translations are very close in meaning to the original Russian text. However, there are a couple of minor differences:

1. In the original Russian, the phrase ""Финансовая разведка Эстонии"" (lit. ""financial intelligence agency of Estonia"") lacks an official name. The reference and machine translations both use ""Estonia's financial intelligence agency"" as a possible rendering, but the reference version is more concise and accurate.
2. The verb tense consistency is improved in the reference version, as the verb ""laundering"" consistently appears in the present-participle form, while the machine version alternates between the verb ""announced"" and the present-participle ""laundering"" in the source.

Overall. the reference and machine versions share the same meaning and convey the information identically. However, the reference version is more precise and adheres to standard English conventions.

 Both the machine and reference translation convey the same basic information, namely that the UGMC and RMK have returned a square near the Drama Theater to Yekaterinburg. However, there are some differences in how they express this information.

One difference is that the machine.translation uses the phrase ""the square near the Drumtheater"" while the reference translation uses ""the square near the Drama Theater."" ""Drumtheater"" and ""Drama Theater"" both refer to the same thing, but the reference translation uses a more familiar term for English-speaking readers, which may make it easier for them to understand.

Another difference is that the machine.translation uses the present perfect tense (""have returned""), while the reference.translation uses the past simple tense (""returned""). The present perfect is used to indicate that the action of returning the square is completed in the present, but its effects are still relevant now. In contrast, the past simple is used to indicate that the action of returning the square is completed in the past and its effects may or may not be relevant now.

Overall, the reference.translation is clearer and more accessible to English-speaking readers, while the machine.translation is more literal and closer to the original Russian. Depending on the context and purpose of the translation, both translations could be acceptable, but the reference.translation is likely to be more effective in communicating the intended meaning to an English-speaking audience.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are by and large the same, as both convey the same meaning in English. The only slight discrepancy is in the use of the dash versus the comma. In the original Russian text, an en-dash is used (Может кто-то догадается как это решить?), while the reference English text uses a pair of commas (Can anyone guess how to solve this?). However, this is a minor stylistic difference and does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Overall, the machine-generated and reference translations are very similar, and the quality of the Russian-to-English translation is good.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same overall meaning, which is a request for information on moving to the US with a small amount of money. However, there is a subtle difference in the wording used.

The source text uses the phrase ""переехать в США"" which can be literally translated as ""move/transfer/relocate to the USA/USsites States."" Here, ""переехать"" implies a physical move or change of residence.

The machine-generated translation correctly translates ""переехать в США"" as ""move to the USA/the States,"" but the reference-quality human-made version slightly modifies the wording to ""move to the US with a small amount of money?""

The reference-level version modifies the phrasing to make it sound more conversational and engaging, making it more similar to a spoken dialogue. The question-ending punctuation and the addition of ""with a small amount of money?"" at the end of the sentence emphasizes the need for frugality, which is the primary concern of the original inquiry.

In summary. The machine-generated version is accurate, but the reference-level version is more engaging and emphasizes the context of the question.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Word choice: The word ""проглотят"" in the source text was translated as ""will be eaten alive"" in the reference translation, but the machine translation uses the phrase ""you will be alive.""

2. Meaning: The reference translation conveys the idea that being sweet or compliant can lead to being taken advantage of, while the machine translation does not convey this meaning.

3. Sentence structure: The reference and source texts both use a conditional structure, but the machine translation uses a list of future tense verbs.

4. Omission: The word ""be"" is implied in the reference and source texts, but is explicitly stated in the machine translation.

5. Omission: The word ""будешь"" is repeated in the source text, but the reference and machine translations use it only once.

Overall, the reference and source texts convey the idea that being sweet or compliant can lead to negative consequences, but the machine translation lacks this nuance and meaning. Additionally, the wording and grammatical structure of the machine translation differ significantly from the reference and source texts.

 The machine translation you provided differs from the reference translation in a few ways. First, the verb ""науськивал"" in the source text has been translated as ""nodded"" in the machine translation, when a more accurate translation might be ""spewed hatred"" or ""posted negative comments"" against something. The reference translation uses ""pitted against,"" which conveys the idea of opposition or conflict, but loses some of the nuance of the original Russian verb.

Secondly, the phrase ""против родной Империи"" in the source text has been translated as ""against the native Empire"" in the machine translation, and as ""against the native Empire"" in the reference translation. Here, the use of ""native"" might not be the best choice, as it could imply that the empire is related to the person being captured, when in fact it is likely referring to Russia or the Russian-speaking world. A more accurate translation might be ""against the Russian Empire/Russian-speaking world/homeland empire.""

Overall, the machine translation is readable but loses some of the nuance and meaning of the original Russian text. The reference translation is closer to the original text, but could still be improved with more precise language.

 When comparing the machine and reference translations. We can observe that the machine has made some errors in rendering the original Russian text accurately in English.

1. Word Selection: The word ""подсказать"" in the original text is translated as ""suggest"" in the reference, but the machine has translated it as ""can suggest.""
2. Sentence structure: The sentence ""кто может подсказать еще русские сабреддиты где обсуждают фильмы, игры, политику"" is translated by the machine as a question, but the reference correctly interprets it as a statement.
3. Punctuation: The reference correctly inserts a question-mark at the end of the sentence, but the machine omits it.

Overall, the reference is more accurate in conveying the meaning and intent of the original text. The machine's errors in word-choice, sentence structure, and punctuation can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. Therefore, it is essential to use a reliable and accurate machine or human-generated Russian-to-English translation to ensure proper communication.

A more accurate translation of ""отжался"" in this context would be ""pushed back"" as in the reference translation, rather than ""squeezed"" as in the machine translation. ""Pushed back"" better conveys the idea of regaining or increasing a lost position or value, which is the intended meaning in this context. Overall, the reference and machine both convey the same overall meaning, but the reference's use of ""pushed back up "" accurately reflects the intended meaning of the original Russian verb.

The reference version also has a slightly idiomatic or informal tone, as evidenced by the use of the contraction ""Here's"" and the exclamation point. The machine version is more straightforward and lacks this idiomatic quality, potentially making it sound less engaging or less expressive to a native English reader.

 Both the machine and reference translation convey the same overall meaning, which is that the source text is expressing a belief in the existence of mermaids. However, there is a subtle but important difference in the wording used.

The source text uses the imperfective aspect of the verb ""существуют"" (do exist), indicating that the statement is an ongoing or habitual one. This is reflected in the reference translation, which also uses the present tense ""do exist"" to convey the same meaning.

However, the machine-generated translation uses the past tense ""wondered"" instead of the present tense, which alters the meaning slightly. By using the past tense, the sentence implies that the question of whether mermaids exist is no longer in doubt, whereas the original text suggests that the question is still open to speculation.

Overall. the reference and source texts suggest a belief in the existence of mermaids, while the machine-generated text implies that the existence of mermaids is a proven fact. Therefore, the machine-generated text is less accurate than the reference text.

The machine-generated English translation, ""You can't heat the sea,"" differs significantly both in meaning and imagery from the reference text.

The reference text evokes the idea of trying to capture or control something elusive and unattainable, which is what the original idiom ""Шилом моря не нагреешь"" conveys in the source language.

The source idiom essentially means that you cannot catch or control the vastness and depth of the sea, just as you cannot catch the wind in the palm of your hand.

However, the literal English translation of the idiom, ""heat the sea with a sewing needle/pin (Шилом),"" is not a well-known or commonly used saying in the target language.

The reference version is more faithful to the original meaning and tone, as it accurately reflects the original's intent to express a desire for inappropriate behavior towards an under-aged person.

The machine-generated version, on the other hand, is less precise and less impactful, as it can be interpreted differently depending on the context.

The source text in Russian uses the verb ""догнали"" (dognali), which means ""caught up with"" or ""reached."" However, the verb tense used in the original is the past tense, indicating that the event of catching up with Africa has already happened.

The machine translation uses the past tense as well, but the reference-level human-generated version opts for the past tense as well.

However, the reference-level version adds the word ""only"" to the end of the sentence, ""but caught up with Africa only (кросспост)"", implying that the subject wanted to catch up with/reach/outpace Germany, but ended up reaching/catching up with/outpacing only/much less advanced/behind Africa.

The reference-level version thus conveys a slightly different meaning, emphasizing the relative lag in the comparison, and the disappointment of not being able to catch up with the desired target.

The machine-generated version, on the other hand, simply conveys the literal meaning of the original, but does not convey the disappointment of falling short of the desired target.

The word ""indulge"" in the machine-generated version is not an accurate reflection of the meaning of the original idiom, as it implies a self-centered or hedonistic action, while the idiom is meant to convey a lack of unfaithfulness or fickleness.

Therefore, the reference version is a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the meaning of the original idiom compared to the machine-generated one.

837	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation in terms of capturing the meaning of the original Russian phrase. However, there are a few differences that make the machine-generated version sound a bit awkward and less fluent in English.

1. Word choice: In the first sentence, the machine...

> You sow the act,

should use ""deed"" instead of ""act"" to maintain the original meaning and make it sound more idiomatic in English.

2. Repetition: The reference English version avoids repeating the verb ""you sow"" and ""you reap"" for each consecutive line. The machine-generated text repeats the verbs, resulting in a less fluent and slightly redundant-sounding text.

3. Slight inaccuracy: The verb ""пожнёшь"" (pozhnesh) in the original text is translated as ""you reap the habit"" and ""you reap the character"" in the machine-generated text. A more accurate and natural-sounding English equivalent for the first instance of ""пожнёшь"" (pozhnesh) is ""you cultivate the habit"" or ""you grow the habit"" as reaping implies the result of something already grown.

A more accurate and fluent English version of the given phrase is:

> You sow a deed, you cultivate a habit,
> You sow a habit, you grow a character,
> You sow a character, you reap a destiny.

 The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it includes the word ""Let's"" which is not present in the original Russian text. The reference translation is a more literal translation of the Russian phrase ""будем наблюдать"" (budem nabliudat'. Both the reference and the source text use the verb ""наблюдать"" (nabliudat'), which means ""to observe or watch.""

The word ""let's"" implies an invitation or suggestion to observe, whereas the original text simply states that the observation will take place. Therefore, the reference and source texts are more accurate to the original intent of the statement.

839	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine and reference translations are quite close to the original Russian text in terms of meaning. However. there is a slight difference in the way punctuation is used.

In the original Russian sentence, there is a single exclamation mark at the end, indicating a high level of surprise or excitement. In the machine-generated English translation, this has been rendered as a period, which conveys less emotion than the original.

The reference English translation, on the other, has used an exclamation point at the end, better reflecting the emotional impact of the original sentence.

Therefore, the machine-generated English sentence could be improved by adding an exclamation point at the end, to convey the same level of excitement or surprise as the original.

Additionally, the verb ""will return"" in the machine-generated English sentence could be changed to ""is returning"" to maintain consistency with the reference English sentence.

Here is an example of a more accurate and nuanced English translation of the original Russian sentence:

"" nu i tukh povilyos--a otkytie, chto on ne umers, on vozskres, on seichas vozvraschaetsa.""

""Ah, and here is the discovery that he didn't die, he was resurrected, he is returning now!""

 When comparing the machine and reference translations. They both convey the same overall meaning, and there are no glaring errors in the machine-generated version.

However, the main difference between the reference and the machine-generated version is the inconsistent handling of the proper noun ""Собор преподобного Исаакия Далматского"" (St. Isaac's Cathedral of Dalmatia in the English reference version).

The reference version correctly identifies the building as ""St. Isaac's Cathedral of Dalmatia"" while the machine-generated one incorrectly refers to it as ""St. Isaac's Cathedral of Dalmatia"" (Dalmatia is a region in Croatia, not a part of Russia, and it is not related to the name of the cathedral in this context).

This discrepancy is likely due to the lack of knowledge of the proper name of the building in the machine-generated version, and it is a significant difference that could lead to confusion.

Overall, the machine-generated version is understandable, but it lacks the precision and correctness of the reference one.

 The source text in Russian is: ""Бей своих — чужие бояться будут.""

The machine Translation is: ""Страх перед чужими будут стремиться бить своих.""

The reference Translation is: ""Бей своих — чужие бояться будут.""

The machine Translation differs from the reference Translation in the following ways:

1. Word choice: The word ""страх"" (strakh) in the machine Translation is not an accurate representation of the word ""бей"" (biy) in the source and reference Translations. ""Бей"" (biy) in this context is closer in meaning to ""beat"" or ""fight against"" one's own people, not ""fear of.""

2. Sentence structure: The word order in the machine Translation differs from the word order in the reference Translation. The reference Translation maintains the same word order as the source, while the machine Translation inverts the word order, resulting in a less clear meaning.

3. Sentence meaning: The meaning of the sentence in the reference Translation is ""beat your own people and foes will grow scared,"" but the meaning of the sentence in the machine Translation is ""fear of foreigners will try to beat their own people,"" which is not an accurate representation of the meaning in the reference Translation.

In summary, the reference Translation is a more accurate reflection of the meaning in the source text compared to the machine Translation. The reference Translation maintains the same word order and meaning as the source, while the machine Translation differs in meaning and word choice.

The machine.deepl.com translation uses ""Mashka the Unwashed"" while the reference human-made translation has ""Mashka the Unwashed"".

The source text refers to a fictional character, and the use of the name ""Машка немытой"" (Mashka the Unwashed) is not a proper name, but a character name in a Russian satirical song. The proper rendering of this fictional name in the target language (i.e., ""Mashka the Unwashed"") is consistent with the original meaning and conveys the same level of sarcasm and humor. Therefore, the machine-generated and reference human-generated versions of the text convey the same meaning, and the slight variation in the use of quotation marks is not significant.

Overall, the quality of the Russian-to-English translation provided by the machine-generated version is good, and it accurately conveys the meaning of the original text. However, a professional human-generated version is always recommended for more nuanced and sensitive texts, as it can provide a more accurate and culturally appropriate rendering of the text.

Additionally, the machine version has a slight grammatical issue, with the lack of articles in ""the toad and the tail"" (the correct form is ""the toad and a tail"" or ""a toad and a tail"" depending on the meaning intended, as the tail is not a specific tail, but a tail in general, but the toad is specific, so it should be ""a toad"" in the context of the reference version, but the reference also could be correct if the tail is specific tail, for example, a tail of a specific creature, not tail in common meaning, in this case, the reference is also correct, but the lack of articles in the machine is still incorrect, it should be ""a toad and a tail"" in the context of the reference meaning, or ""a toad and the tail"" in the context of the tail is a specific tail of a toad, but the reference is not clear, so the lack of articles in the machine is a mistake.

Overall, the reference and the source convey the same meaning, but the reference is more accurate in the wording and the grammar.

This could be to emphasize the sentence as spoken language, or to conform to a particular style or format.

In this specific instance, the difference between the two English versions is minor and may not significantly impact the meaning of the text. However, it is important to note that the reference version follows a slightly different convention, and that the absence or presence of punctuation or typographical elements can sometimes lead to differences in meaning.

 I don't have access to the specific machine translation and reference translation you are referring to, so I can't compare them side-by-side. However, I can give you some general tips on how to evaluate the quality of a Russian-English translation by comparing it to a reference translation.

1. **Fluency and Naturalness**: Compare how natural and fluent the machine and reference translations sound. A good translation should read smoothly and naturally in the target language, without sounding like a literal word-for-word translation.
2. **Accuracy**: Check if the machine and reference translations convey the same meaning as the source text. Pay particular attention to names, dates, numbers, and technical terms, as these are often mistranslated.
3. **Grammar and Syntax**: Look by comparing the grammatical correctness and sentence structure in the target languages. A poorly translated text might have incorrect grammar, awkward sentence structures, or inappropriate word choices.
4. Coherence and Consistency: A reliable and accurate translation maintains consistency in terminology, style, and tone throughout the text.
5. Context and Id idiomatic Expressions: A competent translation accounts for cultural and idiomatic expressions, preserving the intended meaning and tone.

By carefully comparing the machine and reference translations. You can assess the strengths and weakness of the machine-generated version. Additionally, you might want to use translation quality assessment (TQA) metrics, such as the bilingual evaluation Understudy (BLUE) and the Translation Quality Assessment Procedure (TQAP) to quantitatively evaluate the similarity between the machine and reference versions.

 Both the machine and reference translation are conveying the same meaning that the person who suffered harm or loss is currently in a stable state or condition. The two translations are very similar, and the machine's output is accurate and closely matches the reference.

A possible difference between the two could be the nuance of the Russian word ""потерпевший"" which is used for a person who suffered from an accident, damage, or loss. The reference has translated it as ""the victim"" while the machine has used the more general ""the victim is now in a stable condition.""

4. Word omission: Neither the reference nor the machine version mentions the word ""of"" after ""includes"" in the first part of the sentence.

Difference: None

Overall, the two versions of the English text differ slightly in punctuation and word repetition, but the meaning conveyed is the same. The minor differences in style and word use would not significantly impact the reader's understanding of the information. Therefore, the quality of the Russian-to-English translation provided by the machine is good, with a few minor discrepancies compared to the reference.

 After comparing.the machine translation and the reference translation of ""Пётр Филиппов - Плюсы и минусы пенсионных систем"". I noticed the following differences:

1. Preserving the proper name: In the reference translation, the proper name ""Пётр Филиппов"" is left in its original form, while in the machine-generated version, it is Russified as ""Pyotr Filippov.""

Capitalization: In the reference version, the first letter of the main headline ""Плюсы и минусы пенсионных систем"" starts with a capital letter, while the machine-generated version starts with a lower-case letter.

3. Punctuation: The reference version consistently uses double quotes ("""") for direct quotes, while the machine-generated version alternates between single and double quotes.

4. Word-choice: The reference version prefers the phrase ""pension systems"" while the machine-generated version opts for ""penion systems.""

Overall, the reference and the machine-generated versions share the same meaning, but the reference version appears more consistent and accurate in terms of proper noun preservation, capitalization, punctuation, and word-choice. The minor differences observed in the machine-generated version may lead to confusion or misinterpretation. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate and improve the quality of machine-generated Russian-to-English content to ensure clarity and correctness.

2. Word Usage: The word ""understood"" is used in the reference English version, but the word ""realized"" is more fitting in this context, as it implies that the doctors eventually figured out the problem.

 In this case. the source text in Russian is ""Просьбы о мотивации пост"", and the reference translation provided is ""Post motivation requests"".

The machine-generated translation as ""Motivation requests"" is not as accurate as the reference translation. A more accurate translation of ""Просьбы о мотивации пост"" to ""Posts seeking/asking for motivation"" or ""Motivation request posts/messages/topics/discussions/etc."" would be more reflective of the original intent of the Russian phrase.

The difference between the reference and the machine-generated version is subtle, but the reference version is more precise and clear in meaning. The word ""posts/messages/topics/discussions/etc."" conveys the idea of content that is seeking/asking for motivation, while the word ""requests"" alone is more general and less clear.

 The source text is in Russian and the task is to compare a machine-generated translation. to a reference human-generated one, to evaluate the quality of the Russian-to-English machine-generated translation.

The source text starts with the name of a historical movement: ""Повстанческое движение Нестора Махно"" which is ""Nestor Makhno's Insurrection Movement "" in the reference English translation.

The machine-generated and reference English text share the same meaning, conveying the name of the historical movement. However, the reference text has a minor difference in punctuation, where there is no comma after ""Nestor Makhno's "" in the reference text.

In terms of fluency and grammatical correctness, the machine-generated and reference English text both are correct.

The accuracy of the Russian-to-English machine-generated text is good, as it conveys the intended meaning. However, the reference text has a slight difference in punctuation, and it is essential to consider that even a minor punctuation difference can sometimes impact the meaning of the text.

Therefore, the quality of the machine-generated text is good, but not excellent, as it lacks attention to detail compared to the reference text.

The only difference between the two translations is the use of lowercase ""o"" in the word ""Orthodoxy"" in the machine-generated version. The reference version correctly uses an uppercase ""O"" to indicate the proper noun Orthodoxy.

Other than that, both versions accurately convey the meaning of the original text, which states that a Catholic community in the Philippines, along with bishops and priests, has converted to Orthodoxy.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, but there is a difference in how they present the information.

In the source text. the participle ""били"" (which means ""beaten/struck."" in past tense form) is used to describe the condition of the man's body.

The machine-generated translation opts for a more direct rendering of the original text, placing the verb ""hit"" in the same clause as the ""sledgehammer"" and ""man's body"" but without explicitly stating that the man was the one who was hit.

The reference-quality human-generated version, on the other, clarifies the sequence of actions and states that the ""man who was hit with a sledgehammer"" is the one whose body is on the ground.

While the machine-generated text is not technically incorrect, the reference-standard version provides a clear and unambiguous description of the scene, making it easier for the reader to understand the sequence of actions and the relationship between the different elements of the sentence. Therefore, the reference-standard version is preferable in this case.

 When comparing the machine and reference translations. The main difference is in the first part of the sentence.

However, the machine tends to translate it too literally, while the reference version captures the idiomatic meaning of the Russian phrase, which is ""straight to the point, without beating around the bush, or directly"". Therefore, the reference version translates it as ""Piping hot - let's discuss the campaign that has just finished "" to convey the meaning of the idiom.

In this case, the reference version is more accurate and nuanced, as it preserves the meaning and tone of the original text, while the literal translation of the machine lacks the same impact and meaning.

The source text is ""Не по Сеньке шапка,"" which literally translates to ""Not for Senka hat/cap/headress/etc."" The reference translation correctly conveys the meaning of the original text, which implies that the hat in question is not suitable for someone with a small head, like a child (as ""Senka"" is a Russian diminutive name for a girl, and thus, evokes the image of a small, child-sized head in the minds of Russian readers/listeners, which is not suited for the particular oversized/oversized/one-size-fits-all type of headgear in question, hence the reference to a ""small head"" in the reference English text.

However, the machine-generated text ""Not according to Senka hat"" is not a coherent or meaningful English sentence, and it is not clear what it is supposed to convey. The word ""Senka"" is not a known word in the English language, and the word ""according to"" is not appropriate in this context.

Therefore, the quality of the Russian-to-English machine-generated text is poor, and it is not fit for purpose. A competent human-generated or professional-level Russian-to-English text should convey the meaning of the original text accurately and clearly, as the reference English text does.

 The source text in Russian is ""вытри нюню, подруга,"" which literally translates to ""dry your tears, friend.""

The machine translation ""Get out of here, mate"" is quite far off from the original meaning. It seems that the machine has mistranslated the meaning of ""вытри нюню"" as an instruction to leave or get out, when in fact it is an idiom asking someone to stop crying or hold back their tears.

The reference Translation, ""dry the tears, friend"" is a more accurate and literal rendering of the original meaning.

In summary, the main difference between the machine and reference Translation is that the former failed to recognize the meaning of the Russian idiom and mistranslated it, while the reference Translation provided a faithful and accurate representation of the original meaning.

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are accurate and convey the same meaning as the source text. The source text ""Деньги кончаются"" literally translates to ""money is running out"" in English, and both the machine and reference translations have captured this meaning accurately.

However, it is important to note that while the meaning is the same, the tone and style of the two English translations may differ slightly. The reference translation uses a period at the end of the sentence, while the machine translation does not. Additionally, the reference translation includes a comma after the word ""money,"" while the machine translation does not.

In terms of fluency and readability, the reference translation may be considered slightly more refined, as it uses punctuation marks and formatting to enhance readability. However, the difference in quality between the two English translations is minimal, and both are accurate and convey the intended meaning of the original Russian text.

Overall, the machine and reference translations are very similar, and both accurately convey the meaning of the original source text.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same meaning as the source text. However, there is a subtle difference in the way the two translations use the word ""kindness.""

In the source and reference translations, ""привычной добротой"" is translated as ""the usual kindness."" Here, ""привычной"" means ""usual"" or ""customary"" and ""добротой"" is ""kindness"" or ""benevolence.""

However, the machine-generated translation uses the phrase ""with the usual kindness"" which slightly changes the meaning of the original text. The word ""with"" implies a companionship or association with the kindness, whereas the original and reference texts imply that the kindness is a characteristic of the subject.

Therefore. the reference and source texts convey the meaning that the subject is naturally or usually a kind person, while the machine-generated text suggests that the subject is doing something with kindness, as if it is an action taken with kindness in mind.

Overall, the difference in meaning is subtle and may not significantly impact the overall understanding of the text. However, it is important to note that nuances in language can change the meaning of a sentence, and machine-generated or automated-translations should be used with caution, especially in professional or legal situations.

The machine Translation and the reference Translation both render the Russian phrase ""Избрание Зеленского президентом"" as ""Zelensky's election as president "" which is an accurate reflection of the original text.

The second part of the sentence ""but he should be given a chance "" is also accurately reflected in the machine and reference Translation.

Overall, the machine and reference Translation are very similar and convey the same meaning as the original. The only minor difference is that the reference Translation uses single quotes around ""Zelensky's election as president"" while the machine Translation does not.

The machine-generated English text ""All he got was a spoonful of sweat"" differs significantly from the reference text, ""He is brave enough as to get a spoon,"" and does not convey the meaning of the original idiom.

The reference text correctly interprets the original idiom, ""всей удали у него — что за ложкой потеть?"", as meaning that the person is facing a difficult or challenging situation, but is still able to succeed despite the odds being against them. The reference to a ""spoon"" in the idiom is metaphorical, representing a small or insignificant share of luck or success.

The machine-generated text, on the other hand, appears to be a literal interpretation of the words, and does not convey the intended meaning of the original text. The reference to a ""spoonful of sweat"" is confusing and does not convey the meaning of the original text.

 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation lies in the verb used with the spoon. Instead of ""lick"" in the reference, the machine has translated ""polish
"" which slightly changes the meaning and intent of the original message. The original intent of the phrase ""дай хоть ложку полизать"" is to say something along the lines of ""give. me at least a spoon to do *something* with, even if it's just licking it"". The word ""полизать"" is used in a somewhat idiomatic sense, meaning to use something up, to exhaust it, or to make use of it in any way possible. The word ""полировать/to Polish"" is more literal and implies a more proper use of the object, in this case, a spoon.

More idiomatically, the reference could be rendered as ""give me a spoon to make do with at least"" or ""give me a spoon to do something with, anything"".

The reference to the spoon in the original is metaphorical and implies a desperate situation, where the person is so hungry that even a spoon to lick or play with is of value. The spoon in the reference is not meant to be taken literally, and the verb ""lick"" is used to convey the idea of a lack of food. The verb ""to lick"" is more evocative and expressive in this sense, and the verb ""to make do with/to do something with/to play with "" is more in line with the intent of the original.

In short, the reference to the spoon in the reference is a metaphor for a lack of food, and the verb ""lick"" is more evocative and evocative in this sense. The verb ""to play with/to use"" is more in line with the intent of the original. The verb ""to lick "" is more evocative and evokes the idea of a lack of food, and the verb ""to use "" is more in line with the intent of the original.

In conclusion, the reference to the spoon in the reference is a metaphor for a lack of food, and the verb ""lick"" is more evocative and evokes the idea of a lack of food, and the verb ""to use "" is more in line with the intent of the original.

883	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very close to the original Russian sentence in meaning. However, there is a subtle but important difference between the two English versions.

The difference lies in the word ""добудут"" which is translated as ""will do"" or ""will bring about"" in the reference translation. This is because ""добудут"" is in the imperfective aspect, indicating that the process of obtaining or achieving the future outcome is ongoing or incomplete.

On the other hand, the machine translation translates ""добудут"" as ""will be with us/them,"" which is a more literal but less nuanced interpretation.

A more accurate and nuanced English rendering of the original sentence, which takes into account the imperfective aspect of ""добудут,"" might be:

""The future will be in the hands of, and brought by, the next generation, not us or our children, but the children themselves.""

This interpretation emphasizes the idea that the next generation will be responsible for creating and achieving the future, and that the current generation will pass on that responsibility. The reference translation conveys this meaning more accurately, and thus is a better reflection of the nuances of the original sentence.

 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is subtle but important. The machine translation says ""to be without porridge if there is no butter,"" while the reference translation says ""you won't have porridge if there is no butter.""

The nuance here is one of agency. In the reference translation, the subject of the sentence (implied to be ""you"") is the one who will not have the porridge if there is no butter. In the machine translation, the subject of the sentence is the state of being without porridge, which is only a consequence of the lack of butter.

In other words.

Machine: No butter leads to no possibility of porridge.

To be precise, the reference is saying that the lack of butter results in no porridge, while the machine is saying that the lack of butter results in the inability to have/be without porridge.

 Both the machine and reference translation are very close in meaning to the original Russian source text. However, there is a subtle difference in the article usage in the English translations.

In the machine translation, the indefinite article ""the"" is used before both ""basic characteristics"" and ""generation."" In contrast, the reference translation correctly omits the article ""the"" before ""generation"" as it is not needed in this context. Therefore, the reference version is more accurate.

The correct English translation should be: ""Basic characteristics of civilization are passed down from generation to generation."" (without the article ""the"" in the second part of the sentence, in the same way as in the reference version provided)

 Both the machine translation and the reference translation are very similar in this case, as they both accurately convey the same meaning using the same words in the same order. The only minor difference is that the machine translation uses a lower-case ""y"" in ""yacht"" while the reference translation uses an upper-case ""Y."" However, this is not a significant difference and does not impact the overall meaning or quality of the translation.

 Both the machine and reference translation convey the same basic meaning, but the reference translation is more precise and accurate in reflecting the original Russian source.

The difference lies in the fact that the machine-generated version omits the definite article ""the"" before ""Saudi schoolboy"" and ""American woman,"" whereas the reference version includes it. Definite articles are often dropped in headlines and headings in English, but including them in this context provides more clarity and precision, as it refers to specific individuals involved in the incident.

Moreover, the reference version is consistent with the original Russian in using the preposition ""with"" to describe the nature of the online interaction, while the machine-generated one opts for ""flirting"" as a verb, which slightly alters the meaning and implies a more specific type of interaction.

Overall, the reference version is more accurate and precise, reflecting the original meaning while adhering to standard English grammar and conventions.

895	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 The source text in Russian is: ""Я не отпел, а ты и шапку надел.""

The machine Translation is: ""I didn't sing, but you put your hat on.""

The reference Translation is: ""It's not over yet but you're already leaving.""

The difference between the machine Translation and the reference Translation is quite noticeable.

The source sentence in the present tense is referring to two different actions being performed by different people. The first-person subject (""Я"") did not sing, while the second-person subject (""ты"") is the one who put on a hat.

However, the machine Translation is a literal rendering of the words and grammatical structure of the original, and it does not convey the intended meaning of the reference Translation.

The reference Translation, on the other hand, correctly conveys the meaning of the original, implying that the first-person is not yet ""over"" with something, but the second-person is already moving on to something else (implied by the ""leaving"" action of putting on a hat and leaving the place where the first-person is still engaged in the previous action, which is not specified as singing or something else in the reference Translation, but is specified as singing in the original sentence and the source Translation).

Therefore, the reference Translation is a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the meaning of the original, compared to the literal and incomplete rendering of the machine Translation.

 The source text ""по типу работ Тарантино и Гая Ричи"" can be broken down as follows:

* ""по типу"" - This phrase is an adverbial modifier that means ""of the kind/sort/type.""
* ""работ"" - This is the noun ""works/projects/pieces of work/etc.""
* ""Тарантино и Гая Ричи"" - ""Tarantino and Guy Ritchie""

The reference English translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Russian by using the phrase ""similar to work done by Tarantino and Guy Ritchie.""

The machine-generated English text, however, differs significantly from the reference text. The phrase ""by Tarantino and Guy Ritchie"" is not an accurate rendering of the original. The word ""по"" in the original is not equivalent to the word ""by"" in the machine-generated text.

A more accurate English rendering of the original would be ""in the style of works by Tarantino and Guy Ritchie"" or ""a style similar to that of works by Tarantino and Guy Ritchie.""

 The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is in the last part of the sentence. The machine translation uses the phrase ""mirror measures,"" while the reference translation uses ""tit for tat measures.""

Both phrases convey a similar meaning, but ""tit for tat"" is a more commonly used idiom in English that means responding to an action with a corresponding action. Therefore, the reference Translation is more accurate and flows more naturally in English. Additionally, the use of ""tit for tat"" emphasizes the reciprocal nature of the measures that Moscow will take in response to the pardons for Russians for which the reports were made. Therefore, the reference Translation is more accurate and idiomatic in English.

 When comparing the machine and reference translations. The main difference is in the sentence structure. The reference translation uses the past tense ""was called"" while the machine version uses the future tense ""were called"".

The reference also inserts the word ""one"" to emphasize that only one of his students was called a zealot, but the machine version omits this detail.

The wording of the final clause also differs slightly. The reference says ""who actually ran with knives"" and the machine says ""who were actually running with knives"".

However, it's important to note that in some cases, machine translations can be inaccurate or produce nonsensical translations. In such cases, it's crucial to have a human translator review and edit the machine-generated text to ensure accuracy and fluency.
