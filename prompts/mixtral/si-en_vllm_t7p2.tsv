 The machine translation ""Every frost is named for the Ksupp Buddha"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""Praise be to the Buddha who is saved in all things.""

The source text in Sinhala language ( ISO: si) හැම දැයෙහි මිදුණා වූ කසුප් බුද්ටිනට නමස්කාර වේ වා appears to be expressing a concept of veneration towards the enlightened one (Buddha in this case) for being present/manifest in all things.

However, the machine-generated text ""Every frost is named for the Ksupp Buddha"" is not related to the reference or the source and lacks the concept of reverence towards the enlightened one.

The reference text, ""Praise be to the Buddha who is saved in all things"" is more reflective of the intended meaning of the original Sinhala text.

Therefore, the machine-generated text is not an accurate reflection of the reference and the source and needs to be reviewed and corrected.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, but the machine's translation uses the slang term ""dick"" instead of the anatomically correct term ""penis"" that is used in the reference. The use of ""dick"" could be seen as informal or inappropriate in certain contexts, while ""penis"" is a more formal and objective term. Therefore, the machine's choice of words slightly alters the tone and formality of the sentence compared to the reference. Additionally, the word ""likes to touch"" in the machine's version could be interpreted as a more deliberate or frequent action than the reference's ""touches,"" depending on the context. Overall, the reference and machine versions convey the same meaning, but the word choices and tone may differ slightly.

 The machine translation ""In this way lectured intelligence on the menace, originally to come to pinnacle determination"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""Meditate on the Buddha Dhamma as preached in this manner to truly gain merit and attain Nirvana.""

Here are some of the issues with the machine's attempt at a Sinhala-to-English transcreation:

1. Word-for-word Translation: The machine's attempt to translate the Sinhala sentence word-for-word results in a jumble of words that are difficult to make sense of.
2. Meaningless Phrases: Phrases such as ""intelligence on the menace"" and ""pinnacle determination"" lack meaning and do not convey the intended meaning of the original text.
3. Lack of Coherence: The sentence lacks overall structure and meaning, making it difficult to understand the intended message.

In contrast, the reference translation conveys the meaning of the original text clearly and accurately.

1. Proper Phrasing: ""Meditate on the Buddha Dhamma as preached in this manner to truly gain merit and attain Nirvana"" is a clear and concise sentence that accurately reflects the meaning of the original text.
2. Intended Meaning: The reference translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the text, emphasizing the importance of reflecting on the teachings of the Buddha to gain merit and achieve Nirvana.
3. Overall Structure: The reference translation is well-constructed and conveys a clear and concise meaning, making it an ideal reference for evaluating the accuracy of a Sinhala-to-English transcreation.

In summary, the reference translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original text, while the machine-generated version lacks meaning and fails to convey the intended message. A proper evaluation of the Sinhala-to-English transcreation thus requires careful consideration of the reference text and a thorough analysis of the meaning of the original text.

 The machine translation ""In the ears here, the mansion hole is made of large penetrating jewelry."" is different from the reference translation ""Here, large plug-shaped ornaments are put into the fleshy hole in the earlobe.""

The source text in Sinhala describes the action of inserting large, plug-shaped pieces of jewelry into a hole in the earlobe. Both the machine and reference translations convey this meaning, but the machine translation uses inexact language that results in a less clear and less idiomatic rendering in English.

The primary issue in the machine translation is the word ""mansion hole,"" which is not an established or familiar term in English for the fleshy hole in the earlobe. A more appropriate and clear English phrase for this concept is "" Piercing hole in the earlobe.""

The reference translation is more precise and culturally appropriate, using the term ""plug-shaped"" to convey the large, plug-like shape of the ornaments, and ""fleshy hole in the earlobe"" to accurately convey the meaning of the original Sinhala.

Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate and culturally appropriate than the machine-generated version.

 The source text is in Sinhala language and it appears to discuss some historical figures, namely the daughters of the kings Kavantissa and Saddhatissa. The reference translation states that the daughters of these kings were ordained, which implies that they entered religious life or became nuns.

The machine-generated translation, on the other hand, states that the daughters of the two kings were executed, which is a significant and fundamental difference in meaning compared to the reference and source.

In the source, the word used for ""executed/ordained"" is ""පැවිදි වී සිටියහ"" (pevidi vi), which is commonly used in the Sinhala language to refer to the religious ordination of individuals. Therefore, the reference and source both suggest that the daughters of the two monarchs became nuns, while the machine-generated text suggests the opposite.

Moreover, the word ""හතrics"" (haturi) in the source, which is mistranslated as ""executed"" in the machine-generated text, actually refers to ""daughters of the king"" in this context.

In summary, the reference and source both suggest that the daughters of the two monarchs became nuns, whereas the machine-generated text suggests that the two were executed. Therefore, the reference and the source convey a very different meaning compared to the machine-generated text.

1. Word Choice: In the machine translation, the word ""lai"" is used as a direct object of the verb ""order,"" while in the reference translation, ""Lai"" is used as a proper noun referring to a person's name.
2. Verb tense: The verb tense in the machine translation is inconsistent. The verb ""savan"" (order) is in the present tense, while the verb ""denagan"" (end/save) is in the past tense. In contrast, the reference translation uses consistent past tense throughout the sentence, using ""ordered"" and ""ended/saved.""
3. Word order: The word order in the machine translation is different from the reference, making the meaning unclear.

The corrected Sinhala-English translation would be:

"" Sri Lai aduva ithin investigation enna enddenna, Li Den thun denna.""

Literally translated, this is:

""[She] ordered Sri Lai to end the investigation and thereby [she] ended/saved Li Den's life.""

In this corrected version, the proper noun ""Lai"" is used consistently, the verb tense is consistent, and the word order is clear.

Here are some specific differences to note:

* The machine translation uses the phrase ""problematic political conditions,"" while the reference translation uses ""problematic political situations."" While both phrases convey a similar idea, the reference translation is more precise in using ""situations"" to refer specifically to distinct instances of problems, rather than general conditions.
* The machine translation uses the phrase ""chronic leadership,"" while the reference translation uses ""traditional leadership."" The reference to ""traditional"" in the reference translation provides more context for the type of leadership being referred to, while the phrase ""chronic leadership "" in the machine translation is more vague.
* The machine translation uses the phrase ""definitely escape from "" while the reference translation uses ""does not inevitably arise."" The reference translation is more precise in conveying that a situation in which the upper classes lose their traditional or expected authority is not a guaranteed outcome of an economic crisis.

Overall, the reference Translation is more precise and clear in conveying the intended meaning, while the machine Translation is somewhat vague and less precise. However, the meaning of the two translations is fundamentally the same.

 The source text is in Sinhala language and it appears to discuss the presence of King Tutankhamun in a certain city, referred to as ""amarna"" in the given text.

The machine-translation is ""According to amarna, there is no evidence of king tutankhaton of the city.""

The reference-translation, on the other hand, is ""Accordingly, there is little evidence of King Tutankhamun in the city of Amarna.""

A careful analysis of the machine-translation and the reference-translation reveals that the primary difference between the two is the absence of the word ""little"" in the machine-translation. The reference-translation states that there is ""little evidence of King Tutankhamun in the city of Amarna,"" indicating that there is some evidence, but not a large amount. In contrast, the machine-translation suggests that ""there is no evidence of the Amarna's claim regarding the presence of the ancient monarch in the city.""

Overall, the reference-translation is more nuanced and precise in its wording, and it accurately conveys the meaning of the Sinhala-text. The machine-translation, on the other hand, is less nuanced and less precise, and it may lead to a different interpretation of the meaning of the text. Therefore, the reference-translation is of higher quality compared to the machine-translation.

 The source text in Sinhala seems to be discussing the concept of happiness or luxury, and how it can be obtained or achieved. However, the machine translation provided. ""The signal to the luxury, or knowing the luxury, provides the saddle tolerance or the date."" is significantly different from the reference translation and the source text.

The primary issue with the machine-generated text is that it is not coherent and does not convey the same meaning as the original Sinhala text. The reference to a ""saddle tolerance or the date"" is particularly confusing and unrelated to the topic of happiness discussed in the original.

Upon closer analysis, it appears that the machine has made errors in translating certain words, resulting in a nonsensical and inaccurate rendering of the text. For instance, the Sinhala word ""සුඛය"" (sookaya) which means happiness, has been incorrectly rendered as ""luxury or saddle tolerance "" in the English.

Moreover, the reference to ""knowing the luxury "" in the English is also inaccurate, as the original Sinhala simply refers to the concept of happiness.

In summary, the machine-generated text differs significantly from the reference and the original, with errors in the interpretation of key words and concepts. A more accurate and nuanced Sinhala-to-English rendering of the text is necessary to convey the intended meaning.

The machine Translation provided the English translation as ""Especially in the introduction to the new product market, this development and research is evolutionary."" While the reference Translation provided the English Translation as ""This development and research is paramount, especially when introducing new products to the market.""

When comparing the machine and reference Translation, the main difference is that the machine Translation used the term ""evolutionary"" to describe the development and research, while the reference Translation used the term ""paramount"" to describe its importance.

The word ""evolutionary"" implies a process of gradual change and improvement, while ""paramount"" implies that it is of the utmost importance and should be a top priority.

In this context, the reference Translation seems to be a more accurate reflection of the meaning of the source text, as the text is emphasizing the critical role of research and development in introducing a new product to the market. The use of the word ""paramount"" conveys the urgency and necessity of this process, whereas the word ""evolutionary"" is more passive and less impactful.

Overall, the reference Translation is a more accurate representation of the meaning of the source text, and the machine Translation could be improved by using a more appropriate term to convey the urgency and importance of the process described.

However, the reference Translation provides a more nuanced interpretation, suggesting that the idea is to spread good will of let no living beings suffer and attain Nirvana (Nibbana) by taming the senses.

The main difference between the two translations is the focus on the outcome of the action. The machine Translation emphasizes the action of spreading the goodwill, while the reference Translation emphasizes the outcome of that action, attainment of Nirvana.

Moreover, the reference Translation clarifies the meaning of the saddened creatures, suggesting that the idea is to spread good will of let no living beings suffer, which is not reflected in the machine Translation.

The machine-generated English translation ""The notes of the lateral varieties are mentioned only on a queen"" is quite different from the reference English text ""Records of later years refer only to a queen"" and does not convey the intended meaning of the source.

The reference English version correctly interprets the Sinhala term ""pasukalinee warggawala sathahan"" as ""lateral varieties/types of passions/desires/addictions/diseases etc."" and refers to some records or notes. However, the machine-generated text confusingly refers to ""a queen"" which is not mentioned or implied in the Sinhala text.

Therefore, the machine-generated English text seems to be inaccurate and in need of improvement.

 The source text in Sinhala seems to be discussing the parentage of certain individuals, while both the machine and reference translations provide a similar English rendering. However, there are some differences in the details between the two translations.

In the machine-generated translation, the term ""unidentified descent"".is used, which is ambiguous and does not convey the same meaning as in the reference translation. The reference translation correctly renders the Sinhala term ""හඳුනා"" (unmarried queen/princess/lady) as ""an unidentified queen/princess/lady/unmarried female royalty.""

Furthermore, the Sinhala text seems to imply that the individuals in question (Aknatan and the unidentified female royalty) may have been the parents of someone, whereas the reference English text explicitly mentions the possibility of them being ""their"" (meaning some specific individuals' or entities') parents.

In conclusion, the reference English text is more precise and accurate in conveying the meaning of the original Sinhala text compared to the machine-generated version. The reference text correctly interprets the implied meaning of the original text, while the machine-generated one does not.

Here are the issues with the machine translation:

1. Meaning of ""commercialization of Europe"" - In the source text, the term ""යුරෝපයේ වෙළඳාමේ ද"" (which I assume means ""in the commercialization of Europe"") is not an accurate reflection of the intended meaning. The reference and source texts both refer to ""trade in Europe"" and not the commercialization of Europe.

 The source text in Sinhala discusses a proposal to remove a figure. Both the machine and reference translations identify the figure in question as an emperor or empress, respectively.

The primary difference between the two translations is the identity of the figure being referred to. The source text uses the gender-neutral term ""පිළ  Shiras"" which can refer to either a male emperor or a female empress. The machine and reference translations then interpret this term differently, with the machine favoring a male emperor and the reference favoring a female empress.

A secondary discrepancy is the cause of the proposed removal. The source text mentions a ""ගොඩ අධිකරණය"" or ""great drought/calamity/disaster"" as the context for the proposal, but the machine and reference interpret this differently. The machine simply refers to a ""great year"" and the reference to a ""severe drought"" is not explicitly present in the source.

Additionally, the word ""divides"" is used in the reference English text, but the verb ""divides"" is not present in the Sinhala text. The verb ""branches"" or ""bifurcates"" is more appropriate in this context.

The machine-generated English translation, however, is significantly different from the reference English text and does not convey the intended meaning of the source accurately.

The primary issue with the machine-generated text is that it is incomplete and lacks clarity. The reference to ""the techniques that they met for safety"" in the machine-generated version is confusing and does not make sense in the given context.

 The source text in Sinhala appears to describe an action taken by a female subject with relation to a deity known as ""Mutt"" in the ancient, great temple of Carnac in an unspecific capacity (could be ""in"" or ""to/at/on/about"").

The machine-generated English text differs significantly from the reference translation, describing an action taken by a ""she"" on a ""landscape of/in"" a ""carnac of/in/at Egypt mut(t)'s (a proper noun?).

The reference English text describes a similar situation, but with the female restoring the ""territory/region/sphere of influence/authority of Mutt, the great, ancient deity of Egypt, at/in Carnac.

The primary differences between the reference and the machine-generated English are:

1. The subject of the action: the reference has ""a great deity of Egypt, Mutt"" and the machine-generated English has ""a (probably proper) noun, Carnac of/in/at Egypt, mut's (a genitive)"".

The reference is more faithful to the original Sinhala, as it is clear that the ""Mutt, the ancient great goddess of Egypt"" is the entity being referred to, and the action is being taken in/at/on/to/with relation to this entity.

2. The verb: the reference has ""restored"" and the machine-generated English has ""replaced"".

The reference is more faithful to the original Sinhala, as the verb ""ස්ථාපනය කරන්න"" (stoapann) is more accurately rendered as ""restore/refurbish/renew/maintain/preserve/rehabilitate/give back/give due respect to/give back its due respect to"" in this context.

3. The direct object of the verb: the reference has ""the territory of Mutt, the ancient great deity of Egypt, at/in Carnac"" and the machine-generated English has ""a (probably proper) noun, Carnac of/in/at Egypt, mut's (a genitive)"".

The reference is more faithful to the original Sinhala, as the ""පුරාතන"" (puratana) is more accurately rendered as ""territory/region/sphere of influence/authority of Mutt, the ancient, great, female, divine entity of Egypt, at/in/Carnac"" in this context.

In summary, the reference is more faithful to the source Sinhala, as it is clear that the ""ඇය කාර්නැක්හි ඊජිප්තුවේ පුරාතන මහා දෙවඟන වූ මුට්ගේ භූමිභාගය"" (aia karneki ijipathuve puratana devaran vuwu muttage bhvimbhagaya) is the entity being referred to, and the action is being taken in/at/on/to/with relation to this entity.

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the word order is awkward and makes it difficult to understand the meaning. For example, ""Harda rog"" which means ""hard disease or heart disease"" is placed after ""diabetic doubts"" which creates confusion.

2. Meaning of words: The word ""Tarabaarukkage"" in the source text is translated as ""competitive and diabetic doubts "" in the machine

 The source text in Sinhala seems to be discussing the end of a demolition process by May 2001. However, the machine translation ""By May 2001, Sun Boone was officially endorsed"" is significantly different from the reference translation.

Upon closer examination.

* The term ""හ=""_Sun"" in the source text refers to the sun, while ""Sun Boone"" appears to be a mistransliteration.
* ""අස් කිරීම නිල"" in the source refers to a demolition process, but the machine translation rendered it as an endorsement.

Therefore, the primary issue with the machine-generated text is that it fundamentally misinterprets the meaning of the Sinhala text, resulting in a completely unrelated and inaccurate English translation.

However. there is a subtle but important difference between the two translations. The machine-generated version uses the phrase ""the imperial chola dynasty,"" while the reference version uses ""the imperial Chola dynasty.""

The use of the definite article ""the"" in the reference version implies that the Chola dynasty is already known to the reader or has been previously mentioned. In contrast, the machine-generated version does not use an article at all, implying that the information about the dynasty is being presented for the first time.

The correct usage of articles in English can be complex, especially when dealing with proper nouns and titles. In this case, the reference version is more appropriate, as it assumes that the reader is already familiar with the concept of the Chola dynasty. Therefore, the reference version is a more accurate and nuanced reflection of the original Sinhala text.

Overall, the machine-generated version is understandable and conveys the intended meaning, but the reference version is more precise and better reflects the nuances of the original text.

 The source text is in Sinhala language and it needs to be translated into English. Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source, which is about a royal proclamation related to the establishment of western settlements in the Appalachian Mountains in the year 1763.

However, the machine-generated translation differs from the reference one in a few ways. First, the machine incorrectly renders ""panavana"" (colonies). The reference and the source both use the Sinhala word ""panavana"" (පනවන), but the machine incorrectly interprets it as ""royal announcement/proclamation"" (rather than ""colonies/settlements"").

Second, the verb tenses in the two English versions differ slightly. The reference version is in the past perfect tense, ""had been temporarily prohibited"" (denoting an action completed in the past, before another point in the past, in this case, the time of writing or reading). The machine-generated one is in the simple past tense, ""was temporarily suspended"" (denoting an action completed in the past, at a specific time, in this case, the time of the proclamation in 1763).

The reference version is more accurate, as the verb tense in the source is consistent with the reference's verb tense. The verb ""panividanaya"" (පනිවිදනය) in the source is in the imperfect tense, indicating an action in the past that was not completed. Therefore, the reference's verb tense, ""had been temporarily prohibited"" is more fitting.

In summary, the reference and the source convey the same meaning, but the reference is more accurate in its verb tenses and the interpretation of the word ""panavana"" (පනවන). The machine-generated one is less precise and less consistent with the verb tenses in the Sinhala source.

3. Slight nuance: The reference text specifically mentions the ""simultaneous touches on the *sensor screen*"" while the machine-generated text just says ""on the touchscreen"" which can imply any type of touch on the screen, not necessarily simultaneous.

Overall, the reference text is more specific and accurate in describing the simultaneous action of sending signals by touching the screen in multiple places at once. The machine-generated text lacks clarity and precision in comparison.

189	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
 The source text in Sinhala seems to be discussing a treatment method for some unspecified ailment affecting a fish or fish population.

The machine-generated English text is somewhat incoherent and difficult to understand. The reference English text, on the other hand, provides a clear and concise message that corresponds to the intended meaning of the Sinhala text.

Upon closer examination. the key difference between the machine-generated and reference English text is the phrase ""alcohol with separate isolated lake only that influenced "" in the machine-generated version. This phrase is not present in the reference English version and seems to be a mangled version of the Sinhala original.

The correct English rendering of the Sinhala source should be: ""Therefore, it is not advisable to treat the affected [fish/animal] by isolating it in a separate tank/pool only, without treating the surrounding water as well, as it may be influenced by the ailment/disease as well ""

In summary, the key difference between the reference and the machine-generated English text is the inclusion of an irrelevant and nonsensical phrase that is not present in the original Sinhala. The reference English is a more accurate and clear representation of the intended meaning of the Sinhala.

 Both the machine and reference translations are by and large the same, conveying the idea that the person in question held the role of a hip-hop dance teacher. However, the source text is in Sinhala, which differs in grammar, syntax, and idiomatic expressions compared to English.

The Sinhala sentence ( Sri Lankan language) is: මෙහි ඇය නිරූපණය කළේ හිප් හොප් නර්තන ගුරුවරියකගේ චරිතයයි.

The given reference and the machine-generated English version are quite accurate, but the reference version seems slightly more natural and better reflects the nuances of the original Sinhala sentence.

A more literal word-for-word breakdown of the Sinhala sentence is as follows:

- මෙහි (mehi) - pronoun referring to the previously mentioned entity (a female in this context)
- ඇය (aya) - pronoun referring to the previously mentioned entity (a female in this context)
- නිරූපණය (niruupana) - the action of representing, depicting, or portraying
- කළේ (kale) - in the capacity of, as
- හිප් (hip) - short for ""hip-hop""
- හොප් (hop) - short for ""hop""
- නර්තන (naertana) - dancer, dance instructor
- ගුරුවරියකගේ (guruwariyakage) - in the role of
- චරිතයයි (chariyayi) - is/was

A slightly more literal English version of the sentence, based on the word-for-word meaning, would be:

*As for her, in the role of a hip-hop dancer, is/was.*

The reference English version is already quite similar to the literal meaning, but it seems to convey the meaning slightly better.

In summary, the machine and reference versions of the English text convey the meaning quite well, but the reference one is slightly more nuanced and more reflective of the Sinhala original. The primary difference between the reference and the machine-generated English text is the word choice and the overall flow of the sentence. The reference text is more in line with the nuances of the Sinhala sentence.

 The source text in Sinhala appears to be describing a medical or scientific topic, likely related to the effects of sound or vibrations on the ear.

The machine translation is not very coherent or accurate. The words ""Gava."" ""Ale"" and ""endosa"" in the machine-generated text do not make sense in the given context.

The reference translation, on the other hand, accurately conveys the meaning of the original Sinhala text. The words ""oval window,"" ""vestibule,"" and ""endolymph"" refer to specific parts of the ear, and the phrase ""causes vibration of the cochlea"" accurately describes the effect of the vibration on the ear.

Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate and appropriate for conveying the meaning of the original Sinhala text than the machine-generated one.

 Both the machine and reference translations follow the same structure and convey the same meaning. However, there are some minor differences in the wording. In the source and reference translations, the phrase ""වැදගත් නඟර"" (translated as ""blockade....interrupted"") relates to the interruption of the reconstructions. In contrast, the machine-generated version uses ""the blockade and the Horsemen"" did not give a ""place of government significantly within the Senate"", which is not a direct or coherent translation of the source.

A careful evaluation of the Sinhala-to-English translation reveals that the machine-generated version contains some irrelevant information that is not present in the original Sinhala sentence. The reference and source sentences convey that the reconstructions were interrupted by the blockade, but the machine-generated text introduversifies the subject, introducing ""the Horsemen did not give a place of government significantly within the Senate,"" which is not in the original.

In conclusion, the reference and source sentences convey the same meaning, but the machine-generated text introduces unnecessary information, making it different from the reference and the source.

 The source text in Sinhala is discussing about Shiite militants capturing several towns in southern Iraq, specifically under al-Sadr.

The machine-generated English translation accurately conveys the main idea of the original Sinhala text, but it contains some errors. The main issue is that the subject of the sentence, ""Shiite militants,"" is placed after the verb ""captured"" in the machine-generated version, while the reference version correctly places it at the beginning of the sentence. Additionally, the phrase ""al sadr"" in the original Sinhala is incorrectly translated as ""al sadr"" in the machine-generated text, while the reference version correctly renders it as ""al-Sadr.""

Here is a more accurate English version of the Sinhala source:

""Under the leadership of al-Sadr, the Shiite fighters have seized several cities in southern Iraq.""

Therefore, the reference version is closer to the intended meaning of the original Sinhala, and the machine-generated version contains errors that make it less clear and precise.

The machine-generated English translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Sinhala, but it differs slightly in wording and style from the reference English text.

One notable difference is that the machine-generated text renders the phrase "" Sri Lankan "" in the source as ""Sinhala-English"" in the first sentence, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the reference English version uses quotation marks to emphasize the term ""DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase"" as technical terms, while the machine-generated version does not.

Overall, the machine-generated English version is understandable and conveys the intended meaning, but it could be improved in terms of style and accuracy.

The reference English text conveys the same meaning, but it is more explicit in stating that ""Holland North"" holds this opinion.

The machine-generated English text, however, is significantly different in meaning. The subject of the verb ""developed"" is ""the basic model of the season"" (a literal rendering of the Sinhala ""සමයේ මූලික ආකෘතිය"" / ""the basic model of the period/season""), and the verb is in the passive form, implying an external agent. The reference to ""Holland North"" is inserted awkwardly in the beginning, and the verb ""is of the opinion that"" is not in the Sinhala sentence.

Therefore, the machine-generated English is less clear and less faithful to the original meaning. A more accurate and nuanced English version of the Sinhala sentence might be:

""According to North Holland, the rudimentary design of the period was developed in a roughly fashioned manner.""

(Note: I assume the ""North"" is part of the name ""Holland North"" and not a reference to a direction. If it is a reference to a direction, the English sentence will be slightly different, such as ""According to the opinion of the North in the Holland, the basic model of the period was roughly fashioned/shaped/drawn up in a rudimentary manner."")

Here are the specific issues with the machine translation:

1. Article usage: In the source Sinhala text. the word for ""ocean"" (ස��t Hobli) is used without an article, whereas in the reference translation, the definite article ""the"" is used before ""ocean"" to indicate that a specific ocean is being referred to.
2. Word order: In the machine translation, the phrase ""of the ocean and akia"" is placed immediately after ""bacteria,"" whereas in the reference translation, it is placed after ""virus.""
3. Comparison: In the reference translation, the correct comparison is made between the number of viruses and the combined number of bacteria and acacia. However, the machine translation incorrectly implies that the bacteria and acacia both contain the virus.
4. Meaning: Overall, the machine translation conveys a different meaning from the reference and the source, suggesting that the ocean and acacia both contain 15 times more bacteria than viruses, which is not what the original Sinhala meant.

The machine Translation correctly interprets the meaning of the source sentence, but misses the gender reference.

The reference Translation, however, includes the gender reference by stating ""That's why he kept trying to find more and more oil wells.""

So, the difference between the machine Translation and the reference Translation is the inclusion of gender reference in the reference Translation, which is missing in the machine Translation.

The quality of the Sinhala-to-English Translation by the machine thus can be evaluated as adequate, but lacking in some details.

Therefore, the reference Translation is more precise and accurate in conveying the intended meaning of the original Sinhala text.

246	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
 The source text is in Sinhala language and it needs to be translated into English. Both the machine and reference translations convey the same overall meaning, but there are differences in the wording.

The source text mentions ""බමුණෝද පළමුව මදු රටට යන්නාහු"" which literally means ""Brahmins also first went to the country of Madhu."" The machine has mistranslated this to ""The Bamboo was the first mosque to visit the country"" which is inaccurate.

The reference correctly interprets this as ""The Brahmins also first went to the country of Madhu.""

The second part of the sentence, ""එක්තරා නානටක රන් රුව තබා සැඟවී සිටියහ"" in the source, is translated as ""hiding the golden image in a bath/tub"" in the reference. The machine has translated it as ""hiding the golden sail in a certain bathtub"" which is not accurate.

Overall, the reference is more accurate in conveying the intended meaning of the original Sinhala text compared to the machine. The reference correctly interprets the first part of the sentence and the hidden object in the second part, while the machine incorrectly interprets the first part and the hidden object in the second part.

The machine translation is inaccurate as it translates ""bhagamani ivat kirimu"". as ""The removal of bhagamani"" instead of ""removal of the aorta/aorta removal"" as in the reference and source text.

The reference and the source texts use the word ""bhagamani"" which is a Sinhala word for aorta, and the correct English term should be used in the English version.

For example, the word ""උපාසකතුමா"" which means ""devotee/follower/disciple"" is translated as ""kimi"" in the machine translation, whereas the reference Translation uses the more appropriate ""monk"".
2. Word Order: In the machine Translation, the word order is different from the reference Translation, which makes the meaning unclear. For example, the phrase ""ඒ තෙරුන් වහන්සේට නුඹවහන්සේටද වඩා වැඩි වූ ගුණ ඇත්තෝදැයි"" is placed after the quote, making it unclear who is being referred to.

3. Sentence structure: The Sentence structure in the machine Translation is not as clear as the reference Translation. For example, the phrase ""උපาසු උපස answering the question is at the beginning of the Sentence in the reference Translation, but in the machine Translation, it is placed in the middle of the Sentence, making the meaning less clear.

Overall, the reference Translation is more precise and clear in conveying the meaning of the original Sinhala text compared to the machine Translation.

 The source text in Sinhala seems to be describing an event in which a German chemist named Justus von Liebig gained a reputation for developing a type of silver-coated glass called ""liebig reflectors"" in the year 1835.

The machine-generated English translation accurately conveys the main idea of the source text, but it differs from the reference translation in several ways.

1. The phrase ""පසො���� PERISA glass පිණිසල දර්පණ නිර්මාණය කිරීමේ කීර්තිය"" in the source text refers to the creation of a specific type of silver-plated glass, which the reference correctly identifies as ""silver-plated glass mirrors"" or ""liebig reflectors."" However, the machine-generated English text refers to the creation of ""silver elephant glass mirrors"" which is not an accurate reflection of the Sinhala text.

2. The verb tense in the machine-generated text is inconsistent. The first part of the sentence is in the past tense, but the verb ""handed"" is in the present perfect tense, while the reference correctly employs the simple past tense.

3. The reference correctly identifies the German chemist as ""von Leibig"" while the machine-generated text refers to him as ""Justus Von Liebig"" which is a more complete name but not the standard convention for referring to him.

In summary, the reference is a more accurate reflection of the original Sinhala text, as it correctly interprets the meaning of the text and maintains consistent verb tense and name conventions. The machine-generated text, on the other hand, contains errors in the interpretation of the source text and verb tense inconsistency.

The machine-generated English translation accurately conveys the overall meaning of the text, but it differs from the reference English text in a few ways.

1. The verb tense: The machine-generated text uses the present tense ""succeeded"" to describe the outcome of the steps taken by the IOC, while the reference English version uses the past tense ""were successful.""

2. The verb form: The verb in the machine-generated version is in the passive form, ""was succeeded to increase, "" while the reference English text has an active verb, ""have been successful.""

The machine-generated translation is ""So in 1886 this was 'officially' Liha opened by masparo.""

When comparing the reference and machine-generated translations. We can observe the following:

1. Word-choice: The word ""Liha"" appears in the machine-generated text, but it is not in the reference or source. ""Liha"" is not an English or Sinhala word. The word ""officially"" is repeated twice in the machine-generated text, but it only appears once in the reference.
2. Sentence structure: The sentence structure in the machine-generated text is awkward and unclear. The reference and source sentences both have a clear and straightforward sentence structure, but the machine-generated sentence is confusing.
3. Punctuation: The reference and source sentences both use punctuation to separate the introductory phrase ""As a result"" and the main clause, but the machine-generated sentence does not.

Based on the above observations, the reference and source sentences are more accurate and clearer in meaning compared to the machine-generated text. The reference and source sentences convey the meaning of the text more effectively, and the word-choice and sentence structure are more appropriate.

 The source text is in Sinhala language and it needs to be translated into English. Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea of the source text, which is about the deportation of some Catholics. However, there are differences between the two translations.

The machine-generated translation is closer to a word-for-word rendering of the Sinhala sentence, with some grammatical and syntactical errors. For instance, the phrase "" Sriyan ithin purel daraweim"" in the Sinhala sentence is translated as ""of this establishment were also deported"" in the machine-generated version. A more accurate and readable English version of this fragment would be ""from here/this place/this establishment/were also deported.""

On the other, the reference-provided English sentence is more coherent and accurate. The phrase ""the Catholics in Jaffna deported Father Jusevas and John to Puttalam "" conveys the same meaning as the Sinhala sentence, but with better English and a more precise wording.

In summary, the reference-provided English sentence is a better and more accurate reflection of the Sinhala source text compared to the machine-generated one. The reference-provided English sentence is clear, precise, and easy to understand, while the machine-generated one is less so.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, which is that there is a lack of information or reports about Goguryeo. However, the machine translation differs in its wording.

The machine translation renders the source text as ""Much information about Goguryeo has not been revealed, as many reports **are available**."" The bolded phrase suggests that there are reports about Goguryeo, but simply not as many as one might expect, or that the reports that are available do not reveal much information.

The reference translation, on the other hand, reads ""Much information about Goguryeo has not been revealed, as many reports do not **.[BRACKET MISSING]."" The lack of a concluding phrase in the reference text makes the meaning slightly ambiguous, but it could be interpreted as suggesting that there are simply no reports or information available about Goguryeo.

Overall, the primary difference between the two translations is one of emphasis. The reference text emphasizes the complete lack of information, whereas the machine text emphasizes the relative lack of information compared to what might be expected. A careful evaluation of the context and purpose of the text would be necessary to determine which is more appropriate.

The primary difference is the name ""Hatshepsut"" appearing in the middle of the sentence, which is not present in the original Sinhala sentence. ""Hatshepsut"" is a proper noun referring to an ancient Egyptian queen, and it is not mentioned or implied in the Sinhala sentence.

The reference English text is a more accurate representation of the meaning of the Sinhala sentence, as it conveys the idea of an unspecified matter related to the treatment received by an entity.

The machine-generated text, on the other hand, seems to be influenced by the context of the broader conversation or text, where the proper noun ""Hatshepsut"" is mentioned. However, the proper inclusion of this information is not supported by the given Sinhala sentence.

316	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation ""So, what hey boring to curiosity?"" is quite different from the reference translation ""So, why be lazy to do good?"" The main issue is that the machine's attempt at rendering the Sinhala sentence resulted in a nonsensical English sentence, while the reference translation conveys the correct meaning.

To evaluate the difference. Let's analyze the source and reference sentences in Sinhala and English:

1. The source sentence in Sinhala: එබැවින් කුසල් කිරීමට කුමක් හෙයින් කම්මැලි වන්නේද?

- එබැවින් (ebowun) = so
- කුසල් කිරීමට (kusalkirimata) = to do good
- කුමක් (kumak) = what for
- හෙයින් (heyn) = to be
- කම්මැලි (kamielen) = to be lazy
- වන්නේද (vanneed) = will you do

2. The reference English sentence: ""So, why be lazy to do good?""

- The meaning of the reference sentence is to encourage someone to take action and be productive, as opposed to being idle.

3. The machine-generated English sentence: ""So, what hey boring to curiosity?""

- The meaning of the machine-generated sentence is unclear and does not convey the intended meaning of the original Sinhala sentence.

In summary, the reference English sentence is a clear and appropriate rendering of the original Sinhala sentence, while the machine-generated sentence is a poor and confusing attempt. The reference sentence effectively conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which is to encourage someone to be productive and avoid laziness. The machine-generated sentence, on the other hand, is a nonsensical jumble of words that is difficult to understand. Therefore, the reference English sentence is a more accurate and appropriate rendering of the original Sinhala sentence.

The reference and machine-generated English versions translate the Sinhala word ""පහසුකම්ද"" as ""shortcoming/lack/incompleteness/inadequacy/what-you-will (in terms of storage facilities)."" However, the reference version seems to interpret the Sinhala word ""පහසුකම්ද"" as ""there was a lack of/a deficiency of/a need for more storage facilities of 1092-ton capacity"" or ""a storage

 The source text in Sinhala seems to be discussing a record or document related to Nonean Howard Carter, whereas both the machine and reference translations suggest that the text is referring to the report of Nonean Howard Carter about someone's cremation.

The machine translation seems to be a literal and word-for-word translation of the source text, which makes it sound incomplete and awkward in English. In contrast, the reference translation conveys the intended meaning clearly by making necessary adjustments to the wording and sentence structure.

Here are the specific differences:

1. Word Choice: The source text uses the phrase "" Sri Lankabhimani Oho"" which literally translates to ""Nonean"" in English. However, the reference translation uses ""Howard Carter"" which is the correct name of the archaeologist who discovered King Tut's tomb.
2. Sentence structure: The machine and reference translations follow a different sentence structure than the original Sinhala text. In the Sinhala source, the subject and object of the sentence are reversed, making the sentence sound unclear in English. The reference translation rearranges the sentence.
3. Word order: The reference translation modifies the word order slightly to make the sentence flow better in English, while still conveying the intended meaning.

In summary, while the machine and reference translations both convey the intended meaning. The reference version is more readable and natural-sounding in English, making it a better choice for communicating the meaning to English-speaking audiences.

However, the source text in Sinhala contains some errors in spelling or transcription, resulting in the names appearing as ""Wu Weiliyang"" and ""Wu Huaiyuan.""

The reference and machine translations both use the correct spellings of the individuals' names, which suggests that the source text contains errors. Therefore, the primary difference between the source and the reference/machine-generated texts is the spelling of the individuals' names.

Moreover, the Sinhala text in the source appears to be written in a colloquial or informal register, while the reference and machine-generated texts are written in a more neutral, standard register. However, this is not a significant difference in meaning, but more a stylistic one.

The machine translation provided is somewhat incomprehensible and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. Phrases such as ""as well as the sacrifice was written"" and ""of metre religion as well as scholarly classical periods"" are unclear and seem to be inaccurate translations of the original text.

 The machine translation ""This is presently growing up to an uneventful pointed social impact."" is significantly different from the reference translation ""This has now developed into an unresolved protracted social conflict.""

The source text is in Sinhala, a language widely spoken in Sri Lanka. The text refers to a social issue or problem that has been ongoing and unresolved for a long time.

The machine translation seems to have translated the words in the text literally without considering the context or meaning. ""වර්තමානය"" (varthmanaya) in Sinhala means ""occurrence or incident "" but in this context, it refers to a ""social issue or problem "" and the machine has not captured this meaning.

The term ""දික් සියලට"" (dik siyaluw) in Sinhala usually means ""for a long time "" but the machine has translated it as ""up to "" or ""until"" in the sentence.

The word ""ගැස්සුණු"" (gaessanu) in Sinhala refers to a conflict or disagreement, but the machine has translated it as ""uneventful "" which is not accurate.

3. Tense: The verb tense in the machine translation is inconsistent. The verb ""have"" is used twice, while the verb ""kept"" is in the past tense. In contrast, the reference translation is consistent in using the past tense, ""have left records in their evolution.""

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and clear in conveying the meaning of the original Sinhalese text than the machine translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the meaning of the original text, and the wording is more precise and consistent.

 The source text in Sinhala describes a situation where the subject's brother died of unknown causes three years after the subject was around ten years old.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it simplifies the description of the subject's age to ""only ten years old"" and omits the detail that the brother ruled for three years before passing away.

The reference, on the other hand, is more specific in describing the subject's age as ""about ten years old"" and including the detail that the brother ruled for three years.

Overall, the reference is more nuanced and closer to the original meaning of the Sinhala text, as it accurately conveys the subject's approximate age and the time period of the brother's reign. The machine-generated version oversimplifies the information and lacks the same level of detail.

 The machine translation ""The Father has come to accept a group of Catholics from the sides of its gathering"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""A large crowd gathered to welcome the arrival of the Rev. Fr.""

The source text is in Sinhala, a language widely spoken in Sri Lanka, and the task is to translate it to English.

The source text refers to a gathering of people who have come to welcome someone. The reference translation conf confirms that the gathering is to welcome a religious figure, specifically ""the Rev. Fr.""

However, the machine-generated text is inaccurate and confusing. The reference to ""Catholics"" and ""sides of its gathering "" is not supported by the original text and is a mistranslation.

The Sinhala word ""piyatuman"" in the original source refers to a gathering of people, and the word ""peminé"" that follows, is a verb meaning ""to welcome or receive.""

The reference to ""Catholics "" is not in the original text, and the reference to ""sides "" is a poor rendering of the word ""atha"" in the source, which actually refers to the gathering or event.

A more accurate and faithful English rendering of the Sinhala source is: ""A crowd has gathered to welcome the arrival of the reverend father.""

2. Meaning: The machine translation is a literal and word-for-word translation of the original Sinhala sentence, but it lacks context and fails to convey the full meaning of the sentence. The reference Translation, on the other hand, provides more context and meaning, indicating that ""fierce battles erupted"" in Tianjin.
3. Sentence structure: The reference Translation has a clear sentence structure, with a subject, verb, and object, making it easier to understand. The machine Translation, however, lacks proper sentence structure and is just a string of words, making it difficult to comprehend.

In summary, the reference Translation is more accurate and readable compared to the literal and incomplete machine Translation. A more accurate machine Translation would be ""The fierce battles in Tianjin erupted"" or ""Tianjin saw fierce clashes/battles/fighting.""

 The source text in Sinhala describes an event where three bombs exploded in the subway trains in London. Both the machine and reference translations convey this meaning accurately in English.

However. there is a slight variation in the wording used. The machine-generated translation renders ""තත්පර පහලොවක් ඇතුලත"" (tatpara pahalovak etulata) as ""Within fifteen seconds,"" while the reference human translation renders it as ""within fifteen seconds.""

While the meaning conveyed is the same, the reference human-generated version appears more concise and natural in English. The word ""within"" already implies a time frame, so adding ""seconds"" might be seen as slightly redundant. However, this stylistic preference does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the text.

Therefore, the primary difference between the machine and reference-generated English text lies in the use of language and the level of conciseness. The meaning conveyed in the reference and machine-generated versions is consistent with the original Sinhala text.

""In grave paintings, the goguryeo art can be seen as being preserved."" is somewhat similar to the reference Translation, ""Goguryeo art is well preserved in tomb paintings.""

However, the machine Translation seems to have a slight inaccuracy. In the source and reference Translations, it is indicated that the Goguryeo art is preserved or found in the tomb paintings. But the machine Translation states that the Goguryeo art can be ""seen as being preserved"" in the graves paintings.

This phrasing suggests that the viewer or observer can see the preservation of the art, as opposed to the fact that the preservation of the art is actually contained within the tomb paintings.

Therefore, the reference Translation is more accurate, as it states that the Goguryeo ""is well preserved in tomb paintings "" directly, without suggesting that the viewer can observe the process of preservation.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

The word ""crisis"" may not be the best choice in this context, as it implies a sudden and extreme situation, whereas the original Sinhala sentence seems to refer to a more general and ongoing issue.

2. Meaning: The machine translation misses the point that the injustice is the cause or source of the crisis, rather than the crisis itself. The reference translation correctly conveys this nuance by including the phrase ""reasonable reason"" to clarify the cause of the crisis.

3. Sentence structure: The machine translation separates the subject and the object of the sentence, making it sound disjointed and unclear. In contrast, the reference translation maintains a clear and logical sentence structure.

A more accurate and nuanced Sinhala-to-English translation of the sentence would be:

""The other issue is the existence of no justifiable reason for such injustice.""
