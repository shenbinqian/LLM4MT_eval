0	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 The source text is in Nepali and the task is to compare the machine and reference translations to the original.

The source text is: ""२६ र २७ गते दुर्इदिनसम्म सत्याग्रह चलेपछि राजकीय परिषदबाट मागहरू पूरा गरिदिने स्वीकृति प्राप्त भएकाले नेपाली कांग्रेसका अध्यक्SH वी.पी.""

The machine-generated text is: ""W. P., chairman of the Nepali Congress, who obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council after a satellite run of 26 and 27.""

The reference (human-generated) text is: ""B. P. , the chairman of the Nepali Congress , who obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council after a Satyagrah run of 26 and 27 .""

The main difference between the machine and reference texts is the word ""satyagrah"" (satyagrah), which means ""a form of non-violent resistance or civil resistance."" The word in the source is spelled as ""सत्याग्रह"" (satya-agraha) and it is mistranslated as ""satellite run"" in the machine-generated version. The reference version correctly interprets it as ""Satyagrah run of 26 and 27 "" which is consistent with the meaning of the word.

Moreover, the reference also correctly interprets the initial of the name of the chairman of the Nepali Congress as ""B. P."" while the machine-generated one is ""W. P.""

In summary, the reference (human-generated) is more accurate and consistent with the meaning of the original text.

 The machine translation ""His birthday from later investigations is obtained in South India"" is different from the reference translation ""From later investigations, this information is obtained that he was born in South India.""

Here are the issues with the machine's rendering:

1. Word-for-word Translation: The machine's literal interpretation of the sentence results in a choppy and awkwardly constructed sentence in English.
2. Word Selection: The term ""birthday"" is not an appropriate choice in this context, as it refers to a celebration of a person's birth anniversary, not the place of birth.
3. Punctuation: The lack of a comma in the machine's version disrupts the flow and meaning of the sentence.

A more accurate and readable English version of the source text would be: ""Information about his birthplace being South India is obtained from later investigations.""

 The machine translation ""After two weeks of that equal game, they were rebounded between them, but the game ended as before"" differs from the reference translation ""Two weeks after that draw, they played again, but the game ended in a draw like the previous game"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the machine translation uses the phrase ""rebounded between them"" which is not an accurate translation of the original Nepali sentence. A more accurate translation would be ""played the game again''.

Secondly, the machine translation says ""but the game ended as before"" which is not as clear as the reference translation. The reference translation makes it clear that the game ended in a draw like the previous one.

Overall, the machine translation is unclear and contains inaccurate translations, while the reference translation is clear and accurate.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the main idea that the modern concept of federalism originated in the United States during a specific time period. However, there is a difference in how they express this idea.

The machine translation states that the modern concept of federalism is ""considered to have been between"" 1776 and 1789 in the United States. This implies that something happened to the concept of federalism during that time period, rather than explicitly stating that the concept originated during that time.

The reference translation is clearer in expressing that the modern concept of federalism ""originated"" in the United States between 1776 and 1789.

Therefore. the main difference between the two translations is in the use of ""considered to have been"" versus ""originated"". The former implies a less clear or indirect connection to the time period in question, while the latter is more direct and explicit.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the way it interprets the Nepali term ""कार्य लगानी मानिने छ"" which is translated as ""will be considered a working investment"" in the machine-generated version. However, the reference version interprets it as ""will be considered an investment.""

The correct interpretation of the source text should be closer to the reference version, as the original text implies that keeping non-commercial taxable assets will be considered as an investment, not necessarily a ""working"" one. Therefore, the machine-generated version contains an unnecessary addition of the word ""working"" that is not present in the original text.

Moreover, the reference version is more faithful to the original text, as it preserves the meaning of the original sentence, whereas the machine-generated one introduces an unnecessary nuance that is not present in the original.

Overall, the reference version is a more accurate and faithful representation of the original source compared to the machine-generated one.

5	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation ""Milkwood Hillan costs surgically what moves Nori bombs after bringing a search for her"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""Dudhkuwa started shaking, bulls started fighting, the king started to order, what is happening, when asked to search and bring Naari Bam Paikalo that he might be somewhere, they searched for Naari Bam and brought him.""

Here are some of the specific issues with the machine translation:

1. Word choice: Many of the words in the machine translation are not accurate translations of the original Nepali text. For example, ""Hillan"" is not a valid English word and does not mean ""started shaking"" as in the original text. Similarly, ""surgically"" and ""bombs"" are not appropriate translations for ""लाग्यो"" (fought, started) and ""बम"" (bull).
2. Word order: The word order in the machine translation is awkward and unclear, making it difficult to understand the meaning. In contrast, the reference

3. Incomplete sentence: The machine translation only includes part of the original sentence, leaving out the part about the reference to the shaking of the ""Dudhkuwa"" and the commotion that occurred.

Overall, the machine-generated translation is inaccurate and difficult to understand, while the reference

 The machine translation ""From there onwards, he took the post ""Minister"""" is different from the reference translation ""Upon his return, he took the post of ""Minister"""".

The difference is in the phrase ""त्यहाँबाट"" which was translated as ""From there onwards"" in the machine Translation. However, a more accurate translation of this phrase would be ""Upon his return"" as in the reference Translation.

The word ""त्यहाँबाट ""(tyo-haan-bat) is an adverb in the Nepali language, which means 'upon return ' or 'after coming back from there'.

The machine Translation missed the context of ""upon return"" and provided a literal translation of ""From there onwards "" which does not convey the correct meaning in this context.

Overall, the reference Translation is more accurate and flows better in English.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, but there are some differences in how they translate certain words and phrases.

1. Word order: In the source text, the name ""George Grierson Mahoney"" is written as ""George Grierson Mahoneyka."" The machine.-produced translation corrects this to ""George Grierson Mahoney.""

2. Punctuation: The reference and machine translations both use a period after ""Tibet,"" but the source text does not.

3. Word usage: The word ""murmmys"" in the machine and reference translations differs slightly in meaning from the original ""jarjagryrsan"" in the source text. ""Murmmys"" is a more literal and less common English rendering of the original word, which likely refers to a specific ethnic or tribal group in Tibet.

Overall, the reference and machine.-produced English versions of the text convey the same meaning, but the reference version is more accurate and consistent in its use of English conventions. The machine.-generated text is still serviceable, but it could be improved with more careful consideration of word order, punctuation, and word choice.

 The machine translation ""A new era of mcmen was then introduced"" is different from the reference translation ""McMahon then ushered in a new era"" in a few ways.

First, the machine translation uses the phrase ""a new era of mcmen"" which is not an accurate or natural translation of the original Nepali text. The source text actually says ""McMahon,"" which is the proper name of a person, while the machine incorrectly interpreted it as a phrase related to ""mcmen.""

Second, the verb tense used in the machine-generated text is not consistent with the reference text. The reference text says ""McMahon then ushered in a new era,"" which is in the past tense, but the machine-generated text is in the present tense, saying ""was then introduced.""

Overall, the reference text conveys the original meaning of the Nepali text more accurately and fluently, and the machine-generated text contains errors in naming and verb tense.

The machine Translation also lack the plural form in the words ""animals"" and ""bamboos"" which are implied in the original and reference text.

The order of items in the machine Translation differs slightly from the reference, but it does not significantly affect the meaning.

 The machine translation ""The religious scene consists of a sleeping couple of these four months goddesses"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""From a religious perspective, these four months are considered to be the sleeping period of god Vishnu.""

Here are the issues with the machine translation:

1. Use of ""religious scene"" instead of ""religious perspective"" - A scene implies a visual or physical space, whereas a perspective implies a particular point of view or way of thinking.
2. Use of ""couple of these four months goddesses"" instead of ""the sleeping period of god Vishnu""- the source text refers to a period of time associated with the god, whereas the machine has translated it as a collection of deities.
3. Lack of articles- the English language requires articles (a/an/the) to indicate whether a word is singular, plural, or mass, and the absence of articles in the machine's output can lead to confusion.

The reference translation is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text, as it correctly identifies the concept of a ""perspective"" and the ""sleeping period of the god"" in the context of the Nepali text.

The machine Translation provided is: ""During the teenage years, the mind of the apocalypse reveals the power of the apocalypse by revealing the power of the apocalypse.""

The reference Translation provided is: ""During Dashain, people perform various practices to reveal their such inner power with the intension to fulfill their desires.""

When comparing the machine and reference Translation, the major difference is that the machine Translation talks about the ""teenage years"" and the ""mind of the end of the world revealing its power "" whereas the reference Translation mentions ""Dashain "" and ""practices to reveal their such inner power ""

The reference Translation is more accurate and makes more sense as the source text refers to the festival of ""Dashain "" and the practices associated with it, while the machine Translation misses the meaning of the source text. The reference Translation is more reflective of the intended meaning of the source text.

Similarly, the word ""हिन्नतबोध"" in the source text has been mistranslated as ""Hinnabod"" in the machine translation, when a more appropriate translation would be ""insecurity complex"" or ""feelings of inferiority complex.""

Furthermore, the phrase ""गरीवी, पीडा, कहिलेकाहीं भोकै बस्न बाध्य हुनु तथा सन्सारको अन्याय सहनु"" in the source text has been translated as ""to be force to sit and to endure undertaking of a poor and painful and sometimes hungry and to suffer in injustice of the world"" in the machine

Similarly, ""her"" is not mentioned or implied in the original text, so including it in the English translation is incorrect.
2. Lack of concordance: The verb ""were"" used in the machine-generated sentence is not appropriate as it is not mentioned or implied in the original text.
3. Word forms: The verb ""unma"" in the original text is mistranslated as ""unima"" in the machine-generated sentence.
4. Incorrect grammar: The verb tense in the machine-generated sentence is inconsistent. For instance, ""lagging"" is not a valid verb in English, and ""receiving"" is not in the correct tense.

A more accurate English rendering of the original text would be:

However, the machine-generated translation differs in its wording, stating that the units ""run on the command of the center"" (implying that the units simply execute orders from the center, possibly with no room for independent action or deviation from the directives of the central authority.

The reference human-generated,- on the other hand, states that the units ""run under the command of the center"" (suggesting that the central authority oversees and has control over the units, but not necessarily dictating every single action taken by the sub-entities.

In this case, the subtle distinction between the verb tenses and prepositions used in the respective English translations can lead to different interpretations of the level of control and autonomy enjoyed by the constituent entities in the political system. Therefore, the reference-generated version is more nuanced and accurate in reflecting the intent of the original text.

 The machine translation ""It was initially referred to as 'Mangalmurat' or as sankt moch"" is somewhat different from the reference translation ""Worship as 'Mangalmurta' or Shankat Mochakwas started.""

Here are the differences I have identified:

1. Word Selection: The machine chose the verb ""referred to as"" which is not quite accurate in this context. The reference and the source both use the verb ""worship/started worshiping"" which is more fitting in the context.
2. Word Form: The verb tense in the machine's output is in the past tense, ""was referred to as"" while the reference and the source both use the present tense, ""worship/started worshiping.""

Overall, the reference and the source convey the same meaning, but the wording differs slightly.

In terms of meaning.

1. ""France had a long history of autocracy rule"" implies a much broader and longer period of time during which the rule of autocracy was prevalent in the country. On the other hand, the machine-generated sentence ""In France, very early nineteenth century rule was run"" suggests a more specific and shorter time period, namely the very early 19th century.

2. The reference sentence also implies a more critical stance towards the form of government, as ""autocracy"" is a negative term, while the machine-generated sentence is merely descriptive and lacks any evaluative connotation.

In terms of style, the reference sentence is more sophisticated and precise, while the machine-generated sentence is more literal and lacks the nuance of the reference sentence. Additionally, the reference sentence is written in a more natural and fluent English, while the machine-generated sentence contains some awkward phrasing, such as ""was run"" instead of ""existed"" or ""occurred"" to describe the time period of the autocracy.

Overall, the reference sentence is a more accurate and nuanced representation of the meaning intended in the original text, and it is also more stylistically pleasing and sophisticated.

 The machine translation ""Mrada is one of the male sri rama patri saiva manners"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""The dignified man Shree Ram is one of the obeying father's order.""

Here are some of the issues with the machine-generated text:

1. Word order: ""Mrada is one of the male sri rama pati saiva manners"" is a literal, word-for-word translation of the original text, but it doesn't follow standard English syntax. A more appropriate wording might be ""One of Shree Ram's dignified male followers is Mrada.""

2. Meaning of words: ""maryadala purusha"" is translated as ""male sri rama pati saiva manners"" in the machine-generated version, but it actually means ""a dignitary or a respectable/revered man/person/follower of Shree Rama/Ram Rajya (a mythical era of Rama's reign in Ayodhya)"".

3. Lack of fluency: The phrase ""male sri rama pati saiva manners"" is not a standard English phrase and sounds awkward.

The reference version, ""The dignified man Shree Ram is one of the obeying father's order"", is a more accurate and readable English sentence, but it differs slightly from the original meaning.

1. The reference version doesn't explicitly mention that the subject is a ""follower of Rama/Ram Rajya""

2. ""Obeying the father's order"" is not explicitly stated in the original sentence, but implied.

Overall, the reference version is more coherent and accurate, but it can be improved to convey the full meaning of the original sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine.translation uses ""initially"" which means ""at the beginning of a period of time or course of events"" while the reference translation uses ""In the beginning"" which means ""at the start of something"".

 The machine translation ""Because he wanted to know from a different perspective relating to living"" differs from the reference translation ""Because he wanted to know from a different point of view about the world life"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the machine translation uses the phrase ""relating to living"" which is not present in the reference translation. A more accurate translation of the source text would be ""Because he wanted to understand about the world/life from a different perspective/viewpoint/standpoint.""

Secondly, the phrase ""living"" in the machine translation is ambiguous as it could refer to either ""living things. or ""life"" in a philosophical or abstract sense. However, in the reference translation, ""world life"" is used, which makes it clear that the context is referring to life in a broader sense.

Lastly, the reference translation uses the word ""understand"" which conveys a sense of wanting to gain knowledge or wisdom, whereas the machine translation uses ""know"" that may imply a more basic level of awareness.

In summary, the reference and machine translations differ in their level of precision, clarity, and nuance. While the machine-generated version conveys the basic meaning of the original text, the reference version provides a clear and nuanced interpretation, making it easier for the reader to comprehend the intended meaning.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Word Choice: In the machine translation, ""Anwar"" is used instead of ""nwaran."" ""Anwar"" is not a recognized term or name in Nepali or English, while ""nwaran"" refers to a Hindu naming ceremony for newborns.
2. Consistency: The reference translation consistently uses lowercase letters for the word ""god,"" while the machine-generated version uses a capitalized ""God.""
3. Clarity: The reference version is clearer in describing the location of the worship, stating ""in God's place of worship."" The machine-generated version lacks specificity, as ""the worship of Anwar and the gods"" is ambiguous and does not clearly refer to a specific location.

Here's a revised machine-generated version with corrections:

Dharmashala is specifically found to be used in the nwaran and in the place of worship for the deity.

 The machine translation ""A tribunal is required to open the entire basic topic in the table to be certified"" is different from the reference translation ""In order for a clan to be certified, it is necessary to cover all the basic issues mentioned in the table.""

The source text is in Nepali and it states:
""एक कुलखान्दन प्रमाणित हुनका लागि तालिकामा उल्लेख सम्पूर्ण आधारभूत बिषय खुल्नु आवश्यक छ""

A more accurate English translation of the source text is:
""In order for a clan to be certified, it is necessary to fully discuss all the fundamental subjects mentioned in the list.""

The main difference between the reference and machine-generated translations is that the machine version translated ""कुलखान्दन"" (ek kul khandan) as ""tribunal"" and ""तालिकामा"" (ta likama) as ""the table"".

A ""kul khandan"" refers to a ""clan"" or ""family lineage"" in Nepali, and ""ta likama"" refers to ""the points/items in a list or table, or the action of discussing or considering those points/items in a formal or official manner (ta-likhar-ne tapashya-o-laghincha)"".

A ""tribunal"" is a formal group or system of judges(s) and officials that deals with legal cases, and a ""table"" is a piece of furniture with a flat top and one or more legs, or a set of data arranged in rows and columns.

The reference English version correctly interprets the meaning of the original text and conveys the intended meaning of the author, which is the requirement for a clan to fully consider and address all the key/core/basis/foundational/principal/preliminary/formal/germane/relevant/significant/main/obvious/crucial/quintessential/preeminent/overarching/sweeping/gross/sweeping/all-encompassing/comprehensive/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sweeping/sueject matters in the list.

The machine-generated English text, on the other hand, is inaccurate and confusing, as it suggests that a ""tribunal is required to open the entire basic topic in the table to be certified"" which is not the intended meaning of the original text.

 The source text is in Nepali and the task is to compare the machine and reference translations in English.

Comparison:

* The machine and reference versions both agree that in May 2007, Britney hosted an event.
* The machine version says that Britney hosted an episode of m+m's TOUR TITLED HOUSE OF BLUES.
* The reference version says that Britney hosted a series of promotional rallies entitled M + M's Tour at the House of Blues auditorium.

Observations:

* The machine version correctly identifies the event as related to a TOUR, but misses the idea of it being a series of events (a ""series of promotional rallies"" in the reference version).
* The reference to the ""House of Blues"" in the reference version is mangled in the machine version to ""House of Blues"" (with a definite article ""the"" missing in the machine version, and ""blues"" being mistaken as a proper noun in the machine version, as if it is a specific venue, not a description of the venue ""blues house/gallery/mansion/etc."").

Conclusion:

The machine version is less clear and less complete in meaning compared to the reference one. The reference to the ""series of promotional rallies"" is not conveyed in the machine version, and the reference to the ""House of Blues"" is not conveyed well either. The reference to ""m+m's TOUR TITLED"" is conveyed in the machine version, but the meaning of ""titled"" is not clear in the machine version. Overall, the reference version is more complete and clear in meaning compared to the machine version.

The machine-generated version, however, states ""for the reasons of which there are many tourist gatherings in this location each year"" - this is grammatically correct but sounds less clear and natural in English compared to the reference.

Overall, the reference and machine-generated versions both communicate the same meaning, but the reference is more concise and easier to understand.

68	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation differs from the reference translation both in terms of grammar and meaning.

First, the grammar is incorrect in the machine-generated version. For example, the verb tenses are inconsistent, with ""taking water in his hand"" in the simple past (""took a little water in his hand"") and ""sprinkling it on Radha's face"" in the progressive aspect (""sprinkling it on Radha's face""). Additionally, the word order in the sentence is awkward and unclear, with the phrase ""and read the mantra, and killed himself in the mouth of the knight"" not making much sense in the given context.

In terms of meaning, the machine-generated version is also inaccurate. The reference text describes a peaceful and romantic scene in which the Hindu god Krishna sprinkles a little water on his beloved's face and then starts to play a flute. However, the machine-generated version depicts a violent and confusing scenario in which someone (presumably the ""knight"" referred to in the sentence.

Overall, the machine-generated version is not an accurate reflection of the reference text, and would likely be difficult for a human to understand. A human interpreter, on the other hand, would be able to recognize the poetic and romantic language of the reference text and convey its meaning accurately.

The machine-generated English translation, ""After that time, the Buddhist opponents of the parsi forces and his assistants came to Lockhart to the northern part of today's NUMBER STREET,"" contains several errors.

First, the term ""parsi forces"" in the machine-generated text is not an appropriate rendering of ""Bauddha dharmi"" in the original text, which refers to followers of Buddhism.

Second, the word ""Lockhart"" in the machine-generated text is not a correct name or place and seems to be a result of mistranslation.

Finally, the reference to ""NUMBER STREET"" in the machine-generated text is a nonsensical addition, and it appears to be a result of a mistranslation of the original ""jilla"" in the source, which means ""district"" in English.

The reference English text, ""At that time, the opponents of Buddhism pursued Padalagni Dorje and his supporters to the present-day northern part of the Nuwakot district"" is a more accurate and clear English rendering of the original text.

Therefore, the reference English text is a better reflection of the meaning and intent of the original Nepali text compared to the machine-generated English text.

The source and reference text both refer to the Sanjyals and Hindu Brahmins observing Hindu festivals and rituals. However, the machine-generated text differs in meaning and structure.

1. Word omission: The word ""they"" is missing in the machine-generated text, which is crucial to understanding the subject of the sentence.

2. Sentence structure: The reference text has a clear sentence structure, ""A are/have B"", where ""A"" refers to the subject (the Sanjyals and Hindu Brahmins) and ""B"" refers to the festivals and rituals of the Hindu tradition. The machine-generated text, on the other hand, has a confusing and ambiguous structure, ""A would consider B respectively C"", where ""A"" refers to the Hindu Brahmins, ""B"" refers to the festivals of the Hindu tradition, and ""C"" is missing.

3. Tense inconsistency: The reference text is in the present tense, ""observ[ing]"", indicating a continuous or regular action. The machine-generated text is in the past tense, ""would consider"", implying a one-time or completed action.

Overall, the reference English text is more accurate, clear, and consistent in meaning compared to the machine-generated text. The reference text conveys the idea that the two communities, the Sanjyals and the Hindu Brahmins, observe the festivals and rituals of the Hindu tradition, whereas the machine-generated text is confusing, inconsistent, and incomplete.

 The source text is in Nepali and describes people who smoke excessively and have certain medical conditions related to their lungs. The machine and reference translations convey the same overall meaning, but there are differences in how they express it.

The machine-generated text is difficult to understand due to errors in word order, word choices, and grammar. For example, the phrase ""Tc1 Lymphosite is shamilite and eosionophil is shamilite in some people"" is not clear and seems to be a literal translation of the original text without considering the appropriate grammatical structure in English.

The reference-provided text is much clearer and easier to understand. The first part of the sentence, ""Those people who smoke excessively contain Tc1 lymphocytes,"" is a more accurate and clearer way of expressing the idea conveyed in the original text. The reference-provided text also clarifies that the people referred to are those with COPD, and some of them have eosinophils.

In summary.

- The reference-provided text is more accurate and clear in meaning compared to the machine-generated one.
- The reference-provided text is more readable and easier to understand.
- The reference-provided text is a more accurate representation of the intended meaning of the original text.

 The source text is in Nepali and it appears to discuss some event related to a person named Deuba and the Maoists. The two provided translations both convey the overall meaning of the text, but they differ in their specific word choices and phrasing.

The machine translation renders the source as: ""It was so hurt for the peace with the deaf that the oath of posts came to call for warships and conversations without the oath of posts.""

This is a literal, word-for-word translation that does not convey the intended meaning as fluently as the reference translation. The reference version is more readable and accurate in terms of meaning: ""Deuba was in such a rush for peace talks with the Maoists that he called for a ceasefire and talks ( Invitation) before taking the oath of office.""

The reference version correctly identifies ""Deuba"" as a proper noun, and clarifies that the ""oath of the post"" refers to the ""oath of office"" and the ""conversations"" refer to ""talks or discussions"". The machine-generated version confusingly refers to ""the peace with the deaf"" and ""the oath of the post came to call for warships and conversations without the oath of the post"".

Machine Translation: On October 8 and one episode of the show, cm punk had his encounter with ii while mcmen spoke.

Reference Translation: In a series on October 8, CM Punk confronted McMahon while he was speaking.

The machine-generated English sentence differs significantly from the reference one. The primary issue is the lack of proper noun identification, where ""CM Punk"" and ""McMahon"" (Vince) are not capitalized, and the reference to the ""series/show"" is not explicitly mentioned. Additionally, the sequence of events is incorrect, as the reference has the confrontation happening while ""McMahon was speaking,"" while the machine-generated text implies simultaneity between the episode and the confrontation.

A more accurate English version of the provided sentence in Nepali is:

On October 8, in a series, CM Punk confronted McMahon while he was speaking.

In the reference English sentence, the meaning is conveyed more clearly and accurately. The proper nouns (e.g., ""CM Punk"" and ""McMahon"") are capitalized, and the sequence of the confrontation and the episode is in the correct order.

The reference-translation is more accurate and closer to the meaning of the original text. The machine-generated one contains errors in both grammar and meaning.

The word ""गाऊँको पञ्चायत"" means ""village panchayats"" and not ""singing in old times"" as per the machine-generated version.

The verb ""गठन गरिन्थ्यो"" in the source is correctly understood in the reference-translation as ""formed/established by elections"" but the verb ""governing "" in the machine-generated is not appropriate.

Overall, the reference-translation is more accurate and closer to the meaning of the original. The machine-generated contains errors in grammar and meaning.

 The source text in Nepali is: तब भगवान श्रीकृष्ṇले पनि देवराज इन्द्रको सेखी हरण गर्ने ठाने।

The machine Translation provided is: ""And the goddess also considered to be the lady of the cedar.""

The reference Translation provided is: ""Then , Lord Krishna also thought of taking away the boastfulness of Devraj Indra .""

When comparing the machine and reference Translation, the following differences are observed:

1. The machine Translation refers to a ""goddess"" while the reference Translation refers to ""Lord Krishna""
2. The reference Translation mentions the concept of ""taking away the boastfulness of Devraj Indra"" while the machine Translation does not mention this.

The source text and reference Translation both refer to Lord Krishna, but the machine Translation refers to a ""goddess"" instead. Additionally, the reference Translation includes more information that is not present in the machine Translation, specifically the idea of ""taking away the boastfulness of Devraj Indra"". Overall, the reference Translation provides more context and accuracy compared to the machine Translation.

1. The machine incorrectly identifies ""Serbian team"" as the subject of finishing 5th, when in fact the source text is discussing a person who is the subject of becoming the top scorer.
2. The machine mistranslates ""लगातार ५ औँ र समग्रमा ६ औँ पटक च्याम्पियन्स लिग सिजनको सर्बाधिक गोलकर्ता bhai"" (literally: ""series of 5 and overall 6 times of champion league's top scorer has become"") as ""serbian team finished 5th and contested the champions league 6th time.""
3. The reference translation correctly conveys the meaning of the original text, which is that the person referred to in the sentence has become the top scorer in the champion's league for 5 consecutive series and for the 6th time overall.

The main issue with the machine's attempt at this sentence is that it incorrectly interprets the grammatical structure of the original sentence, and mistranslates the meaning of the original. The reference, on the other hand, accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence.

 The source text is in Nepali and it describes the concept of ""KaalSarpa Yoga"" in astrology, which is considered a ""bad yoga"" or inauspicious configuration of planets. The machine Translation provided is quite different from the reference Translation.

* The source text mentions ""KaalSarpa Yoga jyotish shastra"" which is translated as ""sum Kalsharpa jyotish shastra "" in the machine Translation. The words ""KaalSarpa"" and ""jyotish shastra"" are not translated here, resulting in a nonsensical phrase.

* The reference Translation mentions ""a bad yoga "" while the machine Translation says ""a bad sum"". The word ""yoga"" is mistranslated as ""sum"" in the machine Translation.

* The reference Translation states that ""humans receive only 25 percent of the good fruits that they should get from other good yogas "" while the machine Translation says ""even at 25 percent "" which does not convey the same meaning.

Overall, the machine Translation is inaccurate and misses the meaning of the original text. The reference Translation correctly conveys the meaning of the original text, that ""KaalSarpa Yoga"" is an inauspicious configuration of planets in Jyotish Shastra, and that it reduces the good effects of other auspicious yogas in a horoscope to 25%.

The machine-generated English translation is incomplete and inaccurate. It mistranslates ""timro Shatruharu"". Instead of interpreting it as ""thy enemies"" (as in the reference translation and the original Nepali text intent), the system has translated it as ""thy enemies shall be defiled with many abominations.""

## Protegé AI

>

The system was unable to accurately interpret the source text. It generated an incorrect and confusing sentence that does not convey the meaning of the original.

To improve the quality of the output, the system should be fine-tuned to correctly interpret the meaning of words and phrases in the original language, and to generate a correspondingly accurate and clear English sentence. Additionally, the system should be able to recognize and interpret idiomatic expressions and cultural references in the original language.

108	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 The source text is in Nepali, while the reference translation is in English. The task is to compare the machine-generated translation with the reference one.

The source text in Nepali is: ""निकायबाट मुनाफाको बितरण सम्बन्धी थप ब्याख्या यसै निर्देशिकाको परिच्छेद १घर मा गरिएको छ.""

The machine-generated English text is: ""The additional barrier relating to the distribution of profits from the agency is done in paragraph 13 of the directive.""

The reference English text is: ""The distribution of profits from the body is further explained in paragraph 13 of this directive.""

A careful analysis of the machine-generated and reference English versions shows that the two differ in meaning. The main difference is that the term ""barrier"" in the machine-generated version is not in the reference text, and it is not clear where the idea of a ""barrier"" came from. The reference English and the source Nepali texts refer to the ""distribution of profits from the body/agency"" and not to any ""barrier relating to the distribution of profits from the agency.""

The reference and the source texts also differ in the verb tenses. The reference is in the present tense, ""is further explained in paragraph 13 of this directive."" The source is in the Nepali past tense, ""छ ।"" (chhâ) in the source, meaning ""is done in paragraph 13 of the directive.""

The reference and the source texts refer to the same subject, the distribution of profits from the organization, and the same section of the directive, but the verb tenses differ.

In summary, the main differences between the reference and the machine-generated English texts are the introduction of the concept of a ""barrier"" and the verb tense. The reference and the source texts refer to the same subject and the same section of the directive, but the verb tenses differ.

Second, the term ""kalash"" in the source text, which refers to a water pot or urn. Is incorrectly translated as ""call of the tradition"" in the machine translation. Finally, the verb ""jala bharnu"" in the source text, which means ""to fetch water"" is not accurately translated in the machine version.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning as the source text, which is to cut telephone and mobile lines across the country. However, there is a slight difference in wording.

The machine.translation renders the source as ""cut the lines of telephones and mobiles across the country,"" while the reference.translation renders it as ""cut out the lines of telephones and mobiles across the country.""

The word ""cut"" implies an action of severing or disconnecting, while the word ""cut out"" implies a complete interruption of service. In this context, the reference.translation seems to be a more appropriate and accurate rendering of the intended meaning, as it conveys a more complete and total disconnection of the phone and mobile lines.

Overall, the machine.translation is understandable and conveys the intended meaning, but the reference.translation is more precise and accurate.

Here are some of the issues with the machine-generated translation:

1. Word Choice: ""Contestant"" is not an appropriate translation for ""सम्राट"" (samrāṭ), by context it should be ""emperor"" or ""king""
2. Incorrect grammar: ""Major captain"" is not a grammatically correct or meaningful phrase in English.
3. Incorrect word meaning: ""Defender of law/real estate"" is not an appropriate or meaningful phrase in English.

A more accurate and readable English version of the original text in Nepali is:

""The emperor was the chief justice, the chief of staff, and the legitimate lawmaker.""

Here, ""chief of staff "" is a more appropriate and more commonly used English equivalent for ""मुख्य सेनापति"" (mukhya senāpati) and ""legitimate law-maker"" is a suitable equivalent for ""कानुनका वास्तविक विधाता"" (kānūnakā vas­tavīka vidhātā).

 The source text in Nepali is discussing the desire or willingness of an individual who identifies as transgender to undergo genital transformation surgery.

The machine translation is significantly off the mark, as it translates the phrase ""कोही विषुलिङ्गी भए ऊ मा"". The word ""कोही"" means ""poisoned"" or ""infected"" in Nepali, and ""विषुलिङ्गी भए ऊ मा"" is not a standard or recognizable phrase in the language.

The reference translation, on the other hand, accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, highlighting the desire of an individual to undergo a physical transformation in line with their gender identity.

Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate and appropriate in this case, as it correctly reflects the meaning and intent of the original text.

The machine-generated translation ""Besides carrying its own type of specialty equipment, the social behaviours of the tamang nation including maneuvering, maneuvering, and maneuvering, are described below."" is quite different from the reference text and the original text.

The reference text correctly interprets the text as ""Soical culutre and practices of Tamang community who have carried thier own type of special ancestry and social cuture has been outlined below .""

The main issue with the machine-generated text is that it confuses the meaning of ""PRAKARAKO VISHIShT PUKHYAULI"" (special equipment/features/characteristics in the original text) with ""maneuvering, maneuvering, and maneuvering"" in the generated text.

 Both the machine and reference translations follow the same structure and convey the same meaning. However, there are some minor differences in the language used.

In the source text. the Nepali sentence uses the phrase ""उदाहarणका लागि"" which means ""for example"" to introduce an example related to the subject matter of economics. by contrast, the English reference and machine translations use the phrase ""then uneconomic activity goes to its limit"" to convey the same meaning.

The reference and machine-generated translations use the phrase ""uneconomic activity goes to its limit"" to refer to the negative impact of activities that are not related to economic activities.

The Nepali sentence in the source text uses the phrase ""अनार्थिक क्रियाकलाप"" to refer to ""uneconomic activity"" while the reference and machine-generated English sentences use the term ""uneconomic activity"" to convey the same meaning.

Overall, the machine and reference English sentences convey the same meaning as the original Nepali sentence, but the language and phrasing used differ slightly. The reference and machine-generated sentences use more natural and concise English than the literal word-for-word approach used by the machine.

The machine translation, however, is incomprehensible and does not convey the intended meaning of the source text. The term ""ostensibly"" means ""appearing to be true or real on the surface but actually false or misleading"" and does not fit in the context of the original text.

The reference translation, on the other hand, accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, emphasizing the need to work on something with strong feelings, whether it be enthusiasm or bias.

Therefore. the machine-generated text differs significantly from the reference and the original text, and it is necessary to re-evaluate the quality of the machine-generated text.

2. Word selection: The word ""extraordinary"" in the reference text might not be the best fit for the context, as it suggests something unusual or out of the ordinary. A more appropriate word might be ""additional"" or ""extra-curricular"" to convey the idea of activities beyond the standard curriculum.
3. Smoothness of the text: The reference text has a more coherent and cohesive flow, with the verb ""participate"" being used consistently throughout the sentence. The machine-generated text lacks this consistency, with the verb ""participate"" being used in the first part of the sentence and ""involved in"" being used in the second.
4. Word omission: The reference text includes the word ""after"" to indicate the time of the activities, but the machine-generated text does not.

The machine and reference transaltions both convey the same meaning as the source, but the machine one contains a minor error. The error is in the word ""lack of precipitation"" which is not an appropriate or common idiomatic expression in English to convey the meaning of reduced occurrence of exacerbations or negative health symptoms.

The reference and machine translations are also different in the word choice of ""teotropium"" and ""iapratropium"" which refer to different medications.

3. Vocabulary: The words used in the machine translation, such as ""palladium"" and ""nissarabodh,"" are not accurate translations of the original and create confusion.

In summary, the machine translation misses the main concept of the original and substitutes incorrect entities, resulting in a less accurate and less meaningful version of the original.

 The machine translation ""The path is difficult to pedestrianize tourists as it is small and elongated"" is different from the reference translation ""As the road is small and difficult, it is difficult for tourists to walk.""

Here are the issues with the machine's attempt at a Nepali-to-English rendering of the source text, along with an analysis of how the reference English version addresses those same points:

1. Word-Choice: ""Pedestrianize"" is not a commonly used English verb, and it is not an appropriate synonym for ""walking on foot/afoot/on foot/hiking/trek/touring a place on foot/tourist-walking/touring by foot/touring on foot/touring by shank's pony/touring by foot/touring on one's pins/touring on shank's mare/touring on shanks's pony/tramping a place/tour a place on foot/tour afoot/tour by shank mare/tour by shanks mare/tour on shank's pony/tour on shanks mare/tour on shanks/tour on shanks pony/tour on one's feet/tour on one ' s own feet/tour on one ' s own two feet/tour on your own feet/tour on your own two feet/tour on your own two shoes/tour on your own two shoes/tour on your feet/tour on your own feet/tour on your own two feet/tour on your own two shoes/tour on one' s feet/tour on one ' s own feet/tour on one ' s own two feet/tour on your feet/tour on your own feet/tour on your own two feet/tour on your own two shoes/tour on shank' s pony/tour on shank s pony/tour on shank ' s pony/tour on shank ' s/tour on shank' s/tour on shank ' s/tour on shank ' s p."" (as defined by Princeton's WordNet).

The word ""pedestrianize"" is not a common English verb, and it is not a good fit for the meaning of the original text.

The reference English text avoids this pitfall by using the verb ""to walk"" to convey the meaning of the original text.

2. Sentence structure: The sentence ""The path is difficult to pedestrianize tourists as it is small and elongated"" is not a well-formed English sentence.

The word ""as"" is used incorrectly in the sentence.

The reference English version avoids this pitfall by rephrasing the sentence to ""As the road is small and difficult, it is difficult for tourists to walk.""

3. Word-Form: ""Paidoo"" is the wrong word-form for the word ""Pedestrian"" in the sentence.

The reference English text avoids this pitfall by using the verb ""to walk"" to convey the meaning of the original text.

In conclusion, the reference English version is a more accurate and well-formed English sentence that conveys the meaning of the original text.

The machine's English rendering of the text is not a well-formed sentence, and the word-choice is not appropriate for the meaning of the original text.

The reference English text avoids the pitfalls of the machine's English rendering of the text by rephrasing the sentence and using a more appropriate verb.

 The machine translation ""In this case, it is unnecessary to test comparisons with an overall of opinion"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""In this case, it is unnecessary to perform a comparative test with integration of samples.""

The main issue is that the machine translation conveys a different meaning compared to the reference translation. The reference translation states that a ""comparative test with integration of samples"" is not needed, while the machine translation suggests that ""testing comparisons with an overall opinion"" is not necessary.

The difference in wording can lead to confusion and misunderstanding, especially if the context of the source text relies on the precise meaning of the original phrase.

Moreover, the phrase ""an overall of opinion"" in the machine translation is nonsensical and does not convey any clear meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is inaccurate and may lead to confusion, making it unsuitable for use in a professional or formal setting.

Here are some of the issues with the machine-generated text:

1. **Mistranslation of pronouns and names, and unclear antecedents**: ""These are the sons of Lucy, and Lucy"" is unclear and confusing, as ""Lucy"" appears twice and is translated as a name the first time and a possessive noun the second. The reference text makes it clear that ""Lakshman, Lakshu, Shankar"" are the ""sons"" mentioned earlier.

2. **Missing information in the machine-generated text (omission errors)**: The reference text states that the three individuals were ""cut"", but the machine-generated version lacks this detail.

3. **Incorrect grammar and wording (commission errors)**: The phrase ""and troubles"" in the machine-generated text is inappropriate and confusing, as it implies that ""Lucy"" and ""troubles"" are somehow related.

Overall, the reference and source information convey the idea that the three people mentioned (surnamed ""Choraaruu"" in the original text, but given as ""sons of Lucy"" in the machine-generated text) were cut, whereas the machine-generated version is confusing and lacks the same meaning.

The main difference is in the word choice used to describe the period in question. The reference translation uses the term ""declining period,"" which implies that the period is marked by a decrease or decline. On the other hand, the machine translation uses the term ""depreciation,"" which typically refers to a decrease in value or quality. While the term ""depreciation"" could conceivably be used to describe a period of time, it is not the most natural or intuitive choice in this context.

Additionally, the word order in the machine translation is somewhat awkward, with the phrase ""this time of the eastern plain"" placed at the beginning of the sentence rather than closer to the word ""depreciation"" where it would make more sense.

Overall, the reference translation provides a clear and concise description of the period in question, while the machine translation is somewhat confusing and less precise.

Comparing the machine and reference Translation, the primary difference is that the machine Translation used the word ""this sum"" to refer to ""यो योग"" (yó yóg) in the original sentence, while the reference Translation used the phrase ""this luck"" to convey the same meaning.

The use of ""sum/money"" to refer to ""luck/fate/opportunity"" is a common metaphor in some languages, including Nepali. However, it is not a literal or direct equivalent to the word ""luck/fate/opportunity"" in English. Therefore, the reference Translation used the more appropriate and culturally relevant phrase ""this luck"" to convey the meaning of ""यो योग"" (yó yóg) in the original sentence.

Moreover, the reference Translation is more concise and clear in expressing the meaning of the original sentence, as it avoids the literal and confusing use of ""sum/money"" to refer to ""luck/fate/opportunity"" and directly states that ""people who have this luck receive the best fruits of Jupiter at the age of 48.""

In contrast, the machine Translation is less clear and less culturally appropriate, as it literally translates ""यो योग"" (yó yóg) as ""this sum/money"" and does not convey the intended meaning of ""luck/fate/opportunity"" in the English language.

The only minor difference is that the reference translation repeats the word ""both"" for emphasis, whereas the machine translation does not. Overall, the machine's translation is of high quality and accurately reflects the meaning of the original text.

 The machine translation ""Jaha has recently built a very good hospital in the place of the community, also writing campuses and schools for education"" differs from the reference translation ""A very good hospital has been built here recently at the initiative of the community and there are also campuses and schools for education in Lekhnath.""

Here are the differences:

1. Word order: The word order in the machine-generated sentence is awkward and unclear. The reference version correctly separates the different elements of the sentence, including the subject, verb, and objects, for better clarity and fluency.
2. Word usage: The word ""place"" is used in the machine-generated sentence to refer to the location of the new hospital. However, the reference sentence correctly uses ""here"" to refer to the location.
3. Lack of articles: The machine-generated sentence lacks articles, such as ""a/an/the"" in English, which can make the meaning less clear. For example, the reference sentence correctly includes the article ""the"" in ""the community"" and ""the initiative of the community"" to specify what is meant.
4. Lack of specificity: The reference sentence is more specific in its word choices, such as including ""here recently"" to indicate the time of the building, and ""in Lekhnath"" to specify the location. The machine-generated sentence lacks this level of specificity, making it less clear and precise.

In summary, the reference sentence is more clear, precise, and natural-sounding in its word choices and sentence structure compared to the machine-generated sentence. The reference sentence effectively conveys the meaning and context of the original text, while the machine-generated sentence is less precise and less clear in its meaning.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Order of elements: In the machine translation, the order of elements is inverted, resulting in a less clear and confusing sentence structure. The reference translation correctly places ""Nepal's official time"" at the beginning of the sentence for better readability.
2. Definite article: In the reference, the indefinite article ""a"" is used to describe the height of the mountain, but the machine incorrectly omits it, resulting in a less precise description.
3. Tense consistency: The reference consistently uses the past tense, but the machine alternates between the past and present tenses, making the sentence inconsistent and less clear.

Overall, the reference is more precise, readable, and accurate in communicating the intended meaning. The machine's version contains errors in grammatical structure, article use, and tense consistency, making it less suitable for conveying the intended meaning.

 In the given source text. the key phrase is ""Shanile hanumanlaa samaa haatsa joodeer vara daan maagchhau.""

The machine Translation provided the following interpretation: ""Saturn requested that Saturn join his hands before Hanuman, and ask for a gift.""

The reference Translation provided the following interpretation: ""Shani joined hands with Hanuman and asked for a blessing.""

Upon analyzing the machine and reference Translations, the primary difference is that the machine Translation interpreted ""Shanile hanumanlaa samaa haatsa joodeer vara daan maagchhau."" as ""Saturn requested that Saturn join his hands before Hanuman, and ask for a gift.""

However, the reference Translation correctly interpreted it as ""Shani joined hands with Hanuman and asked for a blessing.""

The key difference here is that the machine Translation interpreted ""Shanile hanumen laa samaa haatsa joodeer vara daan maagchhau"" as ""Saturn requested that Saturn join his hands before Hanuman, and ask for a gift.""

This is incorrect, as the word ""vara-daan"" in the source language means ""boon or blessing "" and not ""gift "" as interpreted by the machine Translation.

Moreover, the word ""samaa"" in the source language is interpreted as ""hands "" in the reference Translation, which is a more accurate interpretation.

In the machine Translation, the word ""samaa"" is interpreted as ""hands "" for ""sahaaraa"" (help or assistance) and ""hastakaa"" (hands or palms) for ""sahaaraa"" is more appropriate.

Overall, the reference Translation is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the original text.

The reference translation aligns closely with the original text, stating, ""Or if the research problem cannot be resolved, the observation and review of the literature helps to concentrate the attention.""

Source: Subedi, Rajendra, Sampa, Snatriottar Nepali Nibandha, Kathmandu: Pustak Bhandar, 2050.

The discrepancy in the machine-generated version is that it interprets ""Pasal"" (which means ""bookstore"" in English) as ""Publishers"" and ""Pustak Bhandar"" (which also means ""bookstore/book publisher"") is incorrect. Additionally, the year 2050 mentioned in the source is in the Nepali calendar, which corresponds to the year 2023 in the English/Western calendar.

 The machine translation ""Sitting in this vowel, Rahu makes a perpetual journey"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""By sitting in this place, Rahu always makes the native of Dahichiure nature.""

Here are some of the issues with the machine translation:

1. Vowel: In the source text, the word used is ""भावमा"" which means ""in this state/situation/atmosphere/condition etc."". However, the machine has mistranslated it as ""this vowel"", leading to a nonsensical and incomprehensible output.

Solution: The correct English equivalent of ""भावमा"" is ""in this situation/atmosphere/environment/condition/etc.""

2. Rahu: In Hindu mythology, Rahu is a celestial body that is believed to cause eclipses. However, in this context, it is being used as a proper noun to refer to a specific location or entity.

Solution: The reference and source texts use ""Rahu"" to refer to a specific entity, so it is essential to maintain that meaning in the target text.

3. Dahiciure: ""Dahiciure"" is a proper noun referring to a location or entity.

Solution: The reference and source texts use ""Dahiciure"" to refer to a specific location, so it is essential to maintain that meaning in the target text.

4. Sadaiv jaatoklai: ""Saday jaatoklai"" is a verb phrase that means ""makes the native of"" in English.

Second, it seems to have misunderstood ""हनुमान सम्प्रदाय"". The correct translation of ""हनुमान सम्प्रदाय"" here is ""Hanuman sect or followers of Hanuman"" and not ""Hanuman Prophet"" as the machine.translation suggests.

The reference Translation, ""You have blessed us by your presence here. Please tell us the main purpose of your arrival"" correctly conveys the meaning of the original text, which is asking the person to reveal the main purpose of their visit.

Therefore, the reference Translation is more accurate and closer to the meaning of the original text compared to the machine Translation.

It's important to note that the difference between the reference and machine Translation is significant, as the latter can be misinterpreted and lead to confusion. Therefore, manual or human-generated Translation is often preferred, especially for important or official communications.

 The source text is in Nepali and it appears to be describing the belief in the incarnation of the deity Vishnu, who is described as being of blue color. The machine Translation is somewhat different from the reference Translation.

The main difference between the machine Translation and the reference Translation is that the machine Translation uses the term ""goddess of the blue berries"" to refer to the deity, while the reference Translation uses ""Lord Vishnu of blue color."" ""The goddess of the blue berries"" is not a recognized or appropriate translation of the Nepali term used in the source text, which refers to the color of the god, not berries.

The machine Translation also differs in meaning from the reference Translation by including the idea that the deity takes an incarnation to ""defend the religion,"" while the reference Translation uses the phrase ""protect dharma,"" which is a more general and inclusive term that can refer to the moral order, cosmic law, or religion.

The primary issue is that the machine mistakenly interpreted ""बीमारीका पछि"" (bimari kai pachi), which means ""after [an] illness. . . ,"" as ""after three weeks insurance."" This error likely arises from the similarity in sound between ""bimari"" (illness) and ""beemarai"" (insurance in Hindi), causing the machine to choose the wrong word.

When comparing the machine and reference Translation, it is apparent that the machine Translation is significantly different from the reference Translation.

The source Sentence talks about the categorization of people in Nepali society, specifically those who don't wear Janai (a Hindu sacred thread worn by some communities in Nepal and India as a symbol of their faith and culture) as a part of their identity.

However, the machine Translation provided is not accurate and misses the point of the original Sentence. The phrase ""Our society has a nation"" is not relevant to the meaning of the original text.

The reference Translation, on the other, is more accurate and conveys the meaning of the original text.

Therefore, the machine Translation in this case is not accurate and requires manual correction to convey the intended meaning.

 The machine translation ""The Patriarch or matriarch can be analyzed by placing three different patriarchs"" is different from the reference translation ""Patriarchy or Matriarchy can be analyzed by placing them on three different aspects.""

The main issue with the machine translation is that it translates ""पितृसत्ता वा मातृसत्तालाई"". which means ""patriarchy or matriarchy "" as ""three different patrarchs "" which is incorrect.

A more accurate translation of the source text would be ""Patriarchy or matriarchy can be analyzed through three different aspects/viewpoints ""

The reference Translation is accurate as it correctly conveys the meaning of the original text, which is to ""analyze the concept of ""Patriarchy or matriarchy "" by placing them on three different aspects.

Here are some of the issues with the machine translation:

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the verb ""exceeded"" is used, which is not an appropriate translation for the verb ""bhetun"" in the original text. A better choice would be ""crossed over/traversed/jumped over the sea.""
2. Lack of commitment: The verb ""exceeded"" implies that Hanuman went beyond the seashore, but it doesn't convey the idea of a committed action to jump the ocean.
3. Lack of context: The reference text implies that Hanuman made a commitment to jump the ocean and return after meeting Sita. The machine-generated text lacks this context.

A more accurate and nuanced English version of the original text in Nepali is: ""Then, Hanuman resolved to leap over the ocean and return after encountering Sita.""

 The source text is in Nepali and discusses Louei Sohrouraale (Louis XVI) convening a meeting of the Baitak State General Committee to resolve a Caribbean economic crisis 100-50 years later.

The machine translation is different from the reference in several ways. First, the name ""Louis XVI"" is mistranslated as ""Louie sixteen"" in the machine version. The source mentions the time period as ""Pachasi varsh pachadi"" which means ""100-50 years later/after"" but the machine version simplifies it to ""100 50 years later/after"".

The reference text has a more accurate and clearer depiction of the situation, ""after nearly 150 years"" as opposed to the ambiguous ""100-50 years later/after"" in the machine version.

More importantly, the reference depicts the purpose of the meeting as addressing a ""growing economic crisis in the Caribbean"" while the machine incorrectly interprets it as ""resolving the Caribbean

Reference Translation: The lyricist called all Russian voters ""crazy"" / ""pagal"", he said that the Russian voters have always voted for Putin and prevented Russia from progressing.

The main difference between the machine and reference translations lies in the interpretation of the word ""पागल"" (paagal) in the original Nepali source. The machine. Translation interpreted ""pagal/paagal"" as ""paagal's promise"" which is incorrect. ""Pagal/paagal"" actually means ""crazy/insane"" in English.

1. Subject: The subject of the source is ""त्यही पाठ्यक्रमका आधारमा माओवादीले युद्ध लडेको थियो"" which literally means ""The Maoists had fought the war on the basis of the same curriculum."" However, the machine has mistranslated it as ""The battle was fought at the base of the same course.""

2. Verb tense: The verb tense in the reference is past perfect, indicating that the action was completed in the past. The verb tense in the machine's version is incorrect, as it is in the present tense.

3. Omission of the subject: The subject of the reference is ""The Maoists,"" but the machine's version lacks a clear subject, making it confusing and difficult to understand.

Overall, the reference and the machine's version differ significantly in meaning, with the reference being clear and accurate, and the machine's being confusing and incomplete. The reference accurately conveys the meaning of the original, including the subject and verb tense, while the machine's is unclear and lacks the same meaning.

 The machine translation ""The Essai Nearers, who were not able to leave Nepal, were all put to death"" differs from the reference translation ""All Christian Newars who refused to leave Nepal were ordered to be killed"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the subject of the sentence is mistranslated. The source text uses the term ""नेपालि"" which refers to people from Nepal, while the machine incorrectly interprets it as ""The Essai Nearers"".

Secondly. the verb tense is also mistranslated. The source text uses the past tense ""छाड्न"" (to let go/release) while the machine incorrectly interprets it as ""not able to leave"".

Finally, the object of the sentence is also incorrect. The reference text states ""refused to leave Nepal"" while the machine incorrectly interprets it as ""not able to leave Nepal"".

Overall, the machine failed to understand the subject, verb, and object of the sentence, resulting in a completely inaccurate and nonsensical translation.

 The machine translation ""Without Essential Cognition, a synonymous physician features elaborate mental psychology in man"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""Without divine thoughts, material luxuries in fact add to the mental sufferings in humans.""

Here are some of the issues with the machine translation:

1. Meaning of words: The word ""Essential Cognition"" in the machine translation is not an accurate representation of the original Nepali phrase ""ईश्वरीय चिन्तन"" which means ""divine thoughts or thoughts of a god/God"" in English.

2. Incorrect use of synonymous: The word ""synonymous"" in the machine-generated text is not appropriate in this context. Synonymous refers to the quality of being interchangeable in meaning, but in this case, the word is used incorrectly.

3. Lack of clarity: The phrase ""a synonymous physician"" in the machine-generated text is confusing and lacks clarity.

4. Incorrect grammar: The verb tense in the machine-generated sentence is inconsistent, with the verb ""adds"" being in the present tense, while the reference text has the verb ""in fact add to"" in the present perfect tense.

5. Lack of fluency: The sentence lacks fluency and is difficult to read, with awkward phrasing and word choices.

In contrast, the reference text is clear, concise, and accurately conveys the meaning of the original text. The reference text is a more faithful representation of the original text and is a better reflection of the intended meaning.

269	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation and reference transformation share the same basic meaning, but there are some differences in how they convey the message.

1. Word Selection: The machine-generated translation uses ""came to pass"" to describe the situation, which is somewhat archaic and may not be easily understood by all English readers. The reference transformation uses ""endured such atrocities for a year"" to describe the situation, which conveys the hardship and suffering experienced by the people.

2. Sentence Structure: The reference transformation has a more coherent and clearer sentence structure, with the subjects and verbs in a consistent order. The machine-generated transformation, on the other hand, has a more disjointed sentence structure, with the phrase ""that there was no change in it "" interrupting the flow of the sentence.

3. Tone: The reference transformation conveys a more somber and serious tone, emphasizing the hardship and suffering of the people. The machine-generated transformation, on the other hand, has a more neutral and detached tone, failing to convey the full impact of the situation.

Overall, the reference transformation is more accurate and effective in conveying the meaning of the original text, as it is more clear, concise, and emotionally resonant. The machine-generated transformation, while not inaccurate, fails to convey the full meaning and emotional impact of the text.

 The machine translation ""this girl appropriately pierced and she also agreed for it"" differs from the reference translation ""This girl is suitable and she agreed to it"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the phrase ""keTI uPayuktA chE"" in the source text has been translated as ""kept appropriately pierced"" in the machine translation, but this is not an accurate reflection of the meaning in the source text. A more accurate rendering of the phrase in English might be ""is qualified/fit for the purpose"" or ""is suitable/appropriate for the task"".

Secondly, the phrase ""unale pani yasakai namastE"" in the source text has been translated as ""and she also agreed for it"" in the machine translation.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the way it phrases the isolation of the family from the Tamang society. The reference translation uses the word ""very isolated"". However, the machine's version uses ""very separate"" which slightly changes the meaning. In the reference, the isolation is described as a geographical or social separation, while the machine interprets it as a distinction. Additionally, the word ""from"" is used incorrectly in the machine's version, as it should be ""from among"" to maintain the correct meaning. Overall, the reference's wording is clear and precise, but the machine's word choice results in a slightly different meaning.

 The source text is in Nepali and describes the trading activities of the Babylonian civilization in Asia.

 The machine translation deviates from the reference translation in several ways. Here is the source text side-by-side with the two translations for comparison:

| Machine Translation. | India is deserted and deserted because the twenty-fourths of the current eugachy, the womb, the birth, the prison, and the makings, are so.
| Reference Translation. | India is the holy land and the fatherland of Jainism because the twenty-four Tirthakanro's wombs, births, penances, caivalya and Nirvana have taken place here.

1. Subject Agreement: The subject in the source and reference translations is ""India,"" but the machine incorrectly renders it as ""India is deserted and deserted.""
2. Article Usage: The reference correctly includes the definite article ""the"" with ""twenty-four Tirthakanro's wombs, births, penances, caivalya and Nirvana."" However, the machine omits the article entirely.
3. Vocabulary: The word ""eugachy"" in the machine's version is not a standard English word and seems to be a mistranslation of ""yugachar"" (meaning ""of the current eugachy"" in the source text, referring to the cycle of time in Jainism, which is ""yugas"" in Sanskrit).
4. Word Selection: The word ""garbha"" (wombs, origin, source, or place of origin in the source text, depending on the context) is incorrect in the machine's version, which interprets it as ""the womb"" in a literal sense.

In summary, the reference translation is more accurate and reads more fluently. The machine's attempt at the translation is confusing and contains several errors, including incorrect article use, mistranslated and missing words.

 The machine translation ""The alphabet has been looped and the brahmins have lived a teenage life"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""Varnashrama religion has disappeared there and Brahmins are living a miserable life.""

Here are some of the issues with the machine translation:

1. Mistranslation of key terms: The term ""वर्णाश्रम धर्म"" (varnashrama dharma) in the source text refers to the Hindu social and spiritual duty system based on the varnas (castes) and ashramas (stages of life). The machine...ai seems to have mistranslated this as ""alphabet has been looped,"" which makes no sense in this context.

2. Incorrect verb tenses: The verb ""looped"" used in the machine.ai's translation is in the incorrect tense. The verb ""has disappeared"" used in the reference.ai's translation is more appropriate.

3. Incorrect meaning: The phrase ""teenage life"" used in the machine.ai's translation is not an appropriate substitute for the reference.ai's ""miserable life"" in this context.

A more accurate and nuanced English rendering of the original text in the source text is: ""The traditional Hindu social and religious system of varnadharma has disappeared there, and the local Brahmins are living a pitiful existence/miserable life/a life of suffering/a hard-pressed life/a difficult life, as per the reference.ai's version.

Therefore, the reference.ai's version is more accurate and nuanced in this case.

1. The machine incorrectly identifies ""ukta prastavnali"" (the stated proposal/motion/decision) as ""attach the Roman ranges to athurias"" whereas the reference correctly interprets it as ""a proposal/motion/decision to join the Authority (Aathrila in this case)"".
2. The phrase ""ahavan gareko thie"" (was rejected by the) is incorrect in the machine-generated version, it should be ""rejected by the [Roman Ranges]"" as per the reference.

The reference correctly interprets the meaning of the source and accurately reflects the intended meaning.

In summary, the reference and the source both convey the same meaning, but the machine-generated text differs significantly in meaning and grammatical correctness.

Close in meaning to ""the Earl of Hanuman, the king of the Gurkhas"") setting up a statue of Hanuman in front of his palace.

However. there are some differences between the two translations. The main one is the omission of the word ""statue"" or ""image"" in the machine-generated version. While the reference version specifically mentions an ""an image/statue of Hanuman"" (Hanumanako murti), the machine-generated one just says ""had set up Hanuman in front of his palace"" (Hanuman[a-ko] mārgi).

Another minor issue is the inconsistent usage of definite and indefinite articles. In the reference, ""a statue of Hanuman"" is used, but the machine-generated one omits the indefinite article ""a"" and also the possessive ""'s"" in ""Hanuman's"".

The source text mentions ""Tar deshama"" which means ""in several parts of the country"" and ""kehi vidyalaya darbara"" which refers to ""Durbar High School"". The reference translation has captured these nuances by including ""different parts of the country"" and ""Durbar High School"".

The machine Translation ""A few generations later financed by the fishing district's shopping business"" does not accurately reflect the meaning of the source text.

The reference Translation ""A few generations passed after Vashishta Gotrawala Bishta from Dhanku of Achham district moved to Dhadakot "" is a accurate and fluent representation of the meaning of the original text.

In conclusion, the machine Translation is significantly different from the reference Translation and does not convey the correct meaning of the original text. The reference Translation is a accurate and clear representation of the meaning of the original.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"

 The machine translation ""Through the influence of the king's apostle Jonathan was salvaged"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""Through the influence of this virtue king was to get rid of the king's ghost.""

Here are some of the issues with the machine-generated text:

1. Entities: The source text mentions ""राजा"" (rajaa), which means ""king"" in English. However, the machine incorrect.ly identified it as a ""king's apostle"" and mistranslated it as ""the king's apostle Jonathan was salvaged.""
2. Verb tenses: The verb tense in the machine-generated text is inconsistent and unclear. The reference text suggests that the ""ghost of the king was got rid of "" (past tense verb ""got rid of""), but the machine-generated version uses the passive ""was salvaged"" (past tense verb ""was salvaged ""), which is not an appropriate equivalent.
3. Omission of words: The word ""पुण्यको"" (puṇyakō) in the original text is not translated in the machine-generated version. The word ""puṇyakō"" means ""this merit/blessing/punyak"" and is a crucial part of the meaning of the sentence.

A more accurate and faithful English rendering of the original text is: ""Through the power of this blessing, the (king's) ghost was extingoried (got rid of).""

In summary, the machine-generated version is not a reliable or accurate representation of the original text, and it is essential to consider the meaning and intent of the original language carefully.

 The machine translation seems to have some inaccuracies when compared to the reference translation. Here are some of the differences I have noticed:

1. The source text mentions ""Mukhya Mantri"" which means ""Chief Minister"" in English. However, the machine.

translation rendered it as ""thumb200pxci and the nephew of the governor-general of India.""
2. In the reference translation, the author correctly identified the ""Residence of the Governor and Chief Minister of Sikkim"" as the ""head of the state administration which is similar to other states in India.""

However, the machine.

translation failed to convey this meaning clearly and rendered it as ""is the head of the governorate ruling monarchy by the central government.""

3. The reference translation used the phrase ""is the Head of the State Administration which is similar to other states in India"" to describe the role of the Chief Minister of Sikkim and the Governor's Residence.

However, the machine.

translation used the phrase ""is the head of the governorate ruling monarchy by the central government"" that is not accurate and does not convey the intended meaning.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and clear in conveying the intended meaning of the original text. The machine.

305	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation made some errors in translating the source text to English. The primary issue. is that the Nepali phrase ""जगेर्ना र विकासको प्रश्न"" in the source text encompasses a much wider meaning than just ""development/development question"" as translated by the machine. A more accurate and comprehensive rendering of this complex Nepali phrase in the given context is ""the question of preserving and advancing/civilizing efforts/measures/endeavors/strategies/pursuits/questions related to it/them/the aforementioned.""

The reference English text, ""During the Rana rule, the question of preserving and developing language, religion, literature, and culture was similar to a grave crime"" is more precise and a better reflection of the meaning intended in the original Nepali.

Therefore, the primary difference between the reference and the machine-generated text is the inaccurate interpretation of the specific phrase in the source. Additionally, the reference also has better word choices, such as ""During the Rana rule"" and ""the question of preserving and developing"" that convey the meaning more clearly.

 The machine translation ""So all the scenes were turning into the growth of Nepal"" is different in meaning from the reference translation ""Therefore, everyone's eyes were on the prosperity of Nepal Mandal.""

Here are the issues with the machine translation:

1. Use of ""all the scenes"": In the source text, the phrase ""त्यसैले सबैको दृष्टि"" translates to ""everyone's eyes"" in the reference translation. However, the machine.. Translation rendered it as ""all the scenes"", which is inaccurate.
2. Verb tense: The verb tense in the machine. Translation is inconsistent with the verb tense in the reference and the source text. The verb tense in the reference and the source is in the past tense, but the verb tense in the machine. Translation is in the present progressive tense, which is inappropriate.
3. Word choice: The word ""turning into"" is not an appropriate translation for ""दृष्टि नेपालमण्डलको समृद्धिमा परिरहेको थियो "" in the source text. A better choice of words would be ""fixated on/concentrated on/gazed at the prosperity of the region of/Nepal/Nepal-mandal ""

Here is a more accurate machine. Translation of the source:

Therefore, everyone's eyes were on the prosperity of the region of/Nepal/Nepal-mandal.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. Word Choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""aerial drug"". However, the reference translation uses ""Ayurveda"" which is the correct term for the traditional Indian medicinal system described in the Rigveda.
2. Coherence: The reference translation is more coherent and easier to understand, as it clearly establishes the connection between the Rigveda and the term ""Ayurveda."" In contrast, the machine translation is somewhat ambiguous and lacks clarity.
3. Accuracy: The reference translation is more accurate, as it correctly translates the original source and conveys the intended meaning. The machine translation, on the other hand, contains errors and fails to convey the intended meaning accurately.
4. nuance: The reference Translation is more nuanced and reflects the cultural and historical significance of the term ""Ayurveda"" in Indian culture. The machine Translation lacks this nuance and fails to convey the cultural and historical significance of the original text.

""Tyasailai"" is a pronoun in Nepali that refers to a third-person plural, and in this context, it refers to a specific individual, Mr. Khanal.

Secondly, the machine-generated translation mistranslates ""satyata"" (सत्यता) as ""partial truth"" and ""purna satya"" (पूर्ण सत्य) as ""perfection opinion."" The reference.translation correctly interprets ""satyata"" as ""partial truth"" and ""purna satya"" as ""absolute truth/full truth/ultimate truth.""

Finally, the reference.translation correctly conveys the meaning of the sentence, which is that even if there is some truth in Mr. Khanal's perspective, it does not fully represent the complete or ""purna"" truth.

 The source text is in Nepali and describes a biological process in certain plant species. The reference translation conveys the idea that in some plants, the elongation of the upper part of the stem (interbranch tract) occurs earlier and at a faster rate than the elongation of the lower part of the stem (ground one) during the early stages of growth.

The machine-generated translation is somewhat unclear and difficult to understand. ""Paakne"" in the source text refers to the upper part of the plant, and the verb ""paaknue"" means to elongate or stretch. However, the machine-generated text confusingly translates this as ""quickly paking contractions,"" which does not convey the intended meaning.

 The machine translation ""Equivalent to the early days of life and the last days of life events are also found"" slightly differs in meaning from the reference translation ""Similarity in early days of life and the last days of life events are also found.""

The source text matches the reference translation more closely, as it states that there are ""samanatA"" (sameness, similarity) in the types of events or phenomena that occur during the early days of life and the last days of life.

The machine-generated text, on the other, states that the ""equivalent"" or ""sAmya"" of the early and late-life experiences are found, which could imply that the specific experiences themselves, and not just the similarity in the types of phenomena, are equivalent.

Therefore, the reference and source texts convey a similar meaning, but the machine-generated one slightly differs in meaning, and thus, it is less accurate.

 The machine translation differs from the reference translation in a few ways.

Firstly, the machine incorrectly interpreted ""व्यापारिहरु"" as ""merchants"" when it should be translated as ""traders or businessmen/women"".

Second. The phrase ""गढ थियो"" is translated by the machine. as ""was the governor of western"" but it should be ""was the fort of western"" as the source text refers to a physical location, not a person.

Finally, the phrase ""हजमा जाने द्वार"" in the source text is translated by the machine as ""haze for the hindustani museums"" but it is in fact referring to ""a gateway for Hajj for Indian Muslims"".

In summary, the reference and the machine-generated translations differ mainly in terms of the interpretation of certain words and phrases, and the overall meaning conveyed.

 The source text is in Nepali and it states: बिलबोर्डेले पनि २०००को दशकका कलाकारहरू मध्यमा आठौं स्थानमा राखेको थियो।

The machine Translation provided is: ""Billboard also placed eighth in the middle of the 2000's decade artists.""

The reference Translation provided is: ""Billboard also ranked eighth among artists of the 2000s.""

When comparing the machine and reference Translation, the main difference is that the machine Translation translated ""कलाकारहरू"" (kalakarharu) as ""artists"" which is correct, but the machine Translation placed the word in the wrong place, making the Sentence sound nonsensical.

The reference Translation correctly placed the word in a way that makes the meaning clear, i.e. ""Billboard also ranked eighth among artists of the 2000s.""

Moreover, the machine Translation used the phrase ""in the middle of"" which is not in the original text and is not appropriate in this context.

In conclusion, the machine Translation was not accurate and conveyed a different meaning compared to the reference Translation. The reference Translation correctly conveyed the meaning of the Sentence, which is that the ""Billboard"" was ranked eighth among the artists of the 2000's.

The machine translation provided is somewhat understandable,. However, it is not as clear and precise as the reference translation. The machine-generated text says ""the style of the letter is attributed to such a banquet,"" which is not an accurate translation of the original text. A more accurate translation of the Nepali text would be: ""If it also has a style of describing a place, a journey etc., then such essays essentially have a journalistic style.""

The reference translation is more precise and accurately conveys the meaning of the original text. The use of the term ""essays"" in the reference text is appropriate, as the original text mentions the term ""shaili"" in Nepali, which means ""a literary or journalistic piece of writing or speech.""

In summary. the reference Translation is more clear and accurate in expressing the meaning of the source compared to the machine generated one.

However, the grammar and wording in the machine-generated text make it difficult to understand, and it differs from the reference translation in several ways.

1. Word usage: Instead of ""those who wear such illustrations"" in the machine-generated text, the reference translation uses ""such dresses are rare."" The reference version is more clear and direct, whereas the machine-generated version is awkward and unclear.
2. Sentence structure: The machine-generated text has a more complex and confusing sentence structure, with the clause ""the Influence of the styles and designs of the day is found in little those who wear such illustrations."" In contrast, the reference version is more straightforward and easier to comprehend.
3. Vocabulary: The word ""clothing"" is used in the machine-generated text, but the reference text mentions ""dresses are rare.""

However, there are some differences between the machine and reference translations. The machine.. Translation is word-for-word and literal, rendering the text as ""Additional scientific chapters of records and historical statistics that have collected trouble around 2012 have not been investigated.""

The reference, on the other hand, provides a clear and concise English translation: ""No further scientific study and research has been done on the stone archives and historical data collected with difficulty in 2012.""

The reference's use of ""stone archives"" is a more precise and evocative term than the literal ""records and historical data"" of the machine. Additionally, the reference's ""no further"" is more precise and clearer than the machine's ""have not been investigated"" in conveying that no investigation beyond what has already been done.

Overall, the reference's English is more idiomatic and clear, and thus a better reflection of the intended meaning of the original Nepali.

The machine-generated Translation is somewhat unclear and lacks fluency compared to the reference Translation.

The reference Translation is clearer and more precise, specifying that the village chief (implied to be the recipient of the ""Virta"" in this context) was allowed to retain the ""Virta ""at that time.

The machine-generated translation contains some errors in grammar and word choices, which result in a less clear and somewhat confusing meaning.

The primary issue with the machine-generated text is that it confuses the verb tense, using ""siege"" in the present tense and ""abundantly"" in the present participle, while the reference and the original text both use past tense.

A corrected and more faithful version of the text would be:

The Tamagas build chaityas in the name of the deceased after their demise, and one can find such chaityas in abundance in the hills surrounding the Tamag village.

 The machine translation differs from the reference Translation in the following ways:

1. Word Choice: In the machine-generated Translation, the term ""loose"" is used to describe the condition of the farmers and laborers, while the reference Translation uses the term ""bad."" ""Loose"" conveys a different meaning than ""bad"" and may not accurately reflect the source's intended meaning.

2. Register: The machine-generated Translation uses more formal language, with words such as ""magnificent facilities"" and ""public of the magistrates,"" while the reference Translation uses simpler and more accessible language, with terms such as ""the elite"" and ""farmers and laborers.""

3. Sentence structure: The sentence structure in the machine-generated Translation is awkward and difficult to follow, with multiple clauses separated by commas. The reference Translation has a clear and straightforward sentence structure, making it easier to understand.

Overall, the reference Translation is a more accurate and accessible Translation of the source material than the machine-generated Translation. The reference Translation conveys the intended meaning of the source material in a more straightforward and accessible manner, while the machine-generated Translation is awkward and difficult to understand.

 The machine translation seems to have made a few errors in translating the names of the players and the country. Here is the breakdown of the differences between the machine and reference translations:

1. In the source text, the first name mentioned is ""यो खेलमा स्लोभाकियाका जान ड्युरिका"" which means ""Slovakia's Jan Durica
"" in the reference translation. However, the machine has translated it as ""durica to go to Slovakia, stanislav sestek and Vladimir wins"" which is not accurate.
2. The second and third names mentioned in the source are ""स्ट्यानिस्लाभ सेस्टेक"" and ""भ्लादिमिर विज"" which should be ""Stanislav Sestak"" and ""Vladimir Weiss"" respectively. The machine has made errors in the first name (Stanislav to ""stanislav sestek and Vladimir to ""wins"") and the second name (Sestak to ""sestek"" and ""Vejčička"" to ""Vijay"").
3. The last name mentioned in the source is ""पाराग्वेका एनरिक भेरालाई"" which is correctly identified as ""Enrique Vera of Paraguay"" in the reference. However, the machine has incorrectly split the name and the description, resulting in ""Enrique Vera were shown a yellow card.""

In summary, the machine has made errors in the identification and order of the proper nouns, and in splitting the proper noun and the associated information. The reference is more clear and precise in identifying the proper noun and the information associated with it.

 The source text is in Nepali and discusses the role of the Rainadevi's chief priest, who is a Margar ( Magar in English language). The reference Translation provided captures the essence of the original text by highlighting how the Magars (a particular caste or community in Nepal) are active and prominent in religious activities, with the Rainadevi's chief priest being a fine example of this.

On the other hand, the machine-generated Translation is inaccurate and loses the meaning of the source text. The words ""Rainadevi's robot"" suggest that the chief priest is a machine or a robot, which is not the case. Additionally, the phrase ""in-front of the magistrates in-justice "" is vague and does not convey the meaning intended in the reference Translation.

Therefore, it is crucial to carefully evaluate machine-generated Translations and ensure that they accurately reflect the meaning of the source text. In this case, the reference Translation is more accurate and captures the intended meaning of the original text.

The machine Translation provided is: ""So her authority was established in the tower of Purander.""

The reference Translation provided is: ""In this way , his power was established in the Purandar Fort .""

When comparing the machine and reference translation, there seems to be a discrepancy in the interpretation of the proper noun ""पुरन्दर"" which stands for ""Purandar "" in this context.

The machine Translation interpreted ""पुरन्दर"" as ""tower of Purander"", whereas the reference Translation correctly interpreted it as ""Purandar "" which refers to a historical hill-fort in India.

Moreover, the pronoun ""तिनको"" refers to ""his "" in this context, but the machine Translation used ""her "" instead.

Hence, the reference Translation is more accurate and closely matches the original source compared to the machine Translation.

The main difference is in the wording of the object of the preposition ""according to the records of 1794.""

In contrast, the reference translation places the prepositional phrase at the end of the sentence, which is a more common and clearer placement in English.

A more accurate English translation of the given source text is: ""Nepali Congress received a big boost from this movement/uprising/agitation.""

The word-for-word breakdown of the original text is as follows:

* यो (yō) = this/the aforementioned
* आन्दोलन (āndolan) = uprising/movement/agitation
* बाट (bata) = from
* नेपाली काग्रेस (nepālī kagres) = the Nepali Congress (a major political party in Nepal, often abbreviated as NC or CPN-UML in English-language sources)
* लाई (la'i) = received
* दरोगति (dorogati) = a great/big push/impetus/advance/progress
* प्राप्त (prāpta) = obtained/gained
* भयो (bhayō) = happened/occurred

The word ""daroğati"" in the original text is a noun meaning ""a great/big push/impetus/advance/progress"" and it is not related to the word ""degree"" in the machine-generated English text.

The main issue with the machine-generated Translation is that it appears to have translated ""किरातीहरू"" (Kiratias) as ""worms"" and ""पश्चिम"" (west or western part of) as ""to the wood/woods in the west/western part of ""

A more accurate Translation of the source would be ""The Kirantis (an ethnic group in Nepal) carried out/conducted/managed economic and social activities in the western part of Kathmandu ""

It is important to note that the reference Translation is more accurate and closely matches the meaning of the source compared to the machine-generated Translation.

387	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation seems to have mistranslated or misunderstood some of the words and phrases in the source text, which has resulted in a translation that is significantly different from the reference translation.

One of the main issues is that the machine translation seems to have taken some words or phrases in the source text and translated them literally without considering their context or meaning. For example, the word ""प्राविधिक"" in the source text means ""technical"" or ""pertaining to technology"", but the machine. translation renders it as ""threonaut,"" which is not a recognizable English word.

Similarly, the word ""विभागप्रमुखको"" in the source text refers to the ""head of a department or section,"" but the machine.

The reference and machine-generated versions both accurately convey the meaning of the original, but the reference version is more precise in its wording.

The machine-generated version differs slightly in its wording compared to the reference, specifically in the way it phrases the first part of the sentence.

1. The word ""unle"" in the original is mistranslated as ""he"" in the machine-generated version, while the reference correctly interprets it as ""against all 19 opponents of the premier league in the same season.""

The reference correctly conveys the meaning of ""unle"" as referring to the group of 19 opponents, while the machine-generated version mistranslates it as a pronoun referring to a specific (male) person.

2. The word ""sijanamā"" in the original is correctly interpreted as ""premier league"" in the reference, but the machine-generated version incorrectly interprets it as ""the same (sijanamā)"".

Overall, the reference is more precise and accurate in its wording compared to the machine-generated version. The reference correctly conveys the meaning of the original, and avoids the errors made by the machine-generated one.

2. Word Form: The verb ""find"" is inappropriate in the context of the sentence, as it implies a process of searching or discovering, while the original sentence implies a process of worship.

3. Sentence structure: The verb ""served"" is in the wrong tense and should be in the present tense, as in the reference translation.

Firstly, the machine translation uses the phrase ""traded goods"" which is not an accurate translation of the original Nepali sentence. The Nepali sentence uses the term ""रुपमा पनि राम्रो कारोबार गर्यो"" which means ""also did good business"" or ""also made a good financial transaction"" rather than ""traded goods.""

Finally, the verb tenses in the machine and reference versions slightly differ. The reference version is in the past tense, ""Also did good transaction financially "" while the machine is in the present tense ""traded goods "" and ""committing "" which is inconsistent with the meaning of the reference and the source.

The machine-generated translation renders the term ""पहिलो बहुजातीय चुनावमा"" as ""first multi-party elections"" while the reference version renders it as ""first multi-ethnic election held"". Here, the reference version is more precise in conveying the meaning of the original text, as the Nepali word ""बहुजातीय"" implies inclusiveness of different ethnic or social groups, not just political parties.

Moreover, the verb ""प्रदान गरिएको थियो"" in the original is translated as ""was granted/given/awarded/provided fully/completely"" in the machine-generated version, but the reference version is more concise and accurate in using ""was granted/given/awarded/provided in full/comprehensively/entirely"" to convey the meaning of ""पूर्ण मुक्ति"" (full liberation/emancipation/freedom/release/salvation).

Therefore, the reference version is more accurate and nuanced in conveying the meaning of the original text.

Secondly, the word ""पवitra"" in the source text is translated as ""holy and illegitimate"" in the machine-generated text, while the reference text has used the word ""sacred and legitimate"". Here, the reference text has used more appropriate words to convey the meaning of the original text, as ""पवitra"" means pure, sacred, or holy, and not ""holy and illegitimate"" as mistranslated by the machine.

The reference and machine-generated versions share the same core meaning, but the reference version contains more complete and accurate information.

The reference text specifies that the name of the party is the ""Fifth Republic [REVOLUTION]"" (with the word ""REVOLUTION"" emphasized in the reference text, but not in the source text, and thus not included in the machine-generated text).

The reference text also clarifies that the ""freedom"" refers to ""freedom from [jail]"" (a detail not specified in the source, but which is assumed in the reference and the machine-generated text, as the source is discussing political matters related to the leader of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, who was famously jailed for his political activities in the past).

The source text also has the Nepali equivalent of ""studio album"" (""स्टूडियो एल्बम"") in quotes, indicating that ""फेम फ्याटल"" is the name of the album.

The word ""fatal"" is likely a mistranslation by the machine, as the word is not in the original source and is not a fitting description of the album. The word ""fame"" is a more appropriate description, as it is the first word in the name of the album.

 The machine translation ""A husband and merchant named Norcasur was king"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""There was an inhuman and immoral king named Narkasur.""

Here are some of the issues with the machine translation:

1. Incorrect identification of proper noun: The machine incorrectly identified ""Narakasur"". as a ""Norcasur"" and treated it as a common noun, leading to a mistranslation.
2. Incorrect identification of occupation: The machine identified ""Narakasur"" as a ""merchant"" based on the word ""baazarii"" in the original text, which means ""a market or fair"". However, the reference correctly identifies ""Narakasur"" as a ""rajaa"", meaning ""a king or a ruler"" in this context.
3. Incorrect grammatical structure: The grammatical structure of the sentence in the machine-generated text is incorrect. The sentence lacks a clear subject and verb, and the word order is incorrect.

In contrast, the reference text correctly interprets the proper noun, the context of the word ""baazarii"", and the overall meaning of the sentence. Therefore, the reference text is more accurate and a better reflection of the intended meaning of the original text.

2. Word choice: ""Feasts"" and ""mela"" refer to different concepts, and the two are not equivalent. ""Mela"" refers to a fair or a gathering, while ""feasts"" refer to a plentiful supply of food.

3. Verb tense: The verb tense in the machine-generated version is inconsistent. ""Is"" is used to describe the ""mela"" as the ""longest-running and popular one of the yearlings[s]."" However, ""yearling"" is not a valid descriptor for a mela, and the verb tense is inconsistent with the reference text.

When comparing the machine and reference translations to the source, it is clear that the machine has made some errors in its rendering of the original text.

First, the machine has translated ""धृतराष्ट्रका छोराहरु"" (Dhritarashtra's sons in the source and reference) as ""the sons of the patriarch"" in its own version. This is technically correct, but it loses the specific reference to the character ""Dhritarashtra"" in the source, which is important to understanding the meaning of the sentence.

Second, the machine has translated ""मारेर"" (killed in the source and reference text) as ""kill"" in its version, but it is missing the direct object pronoun ""them"" in the sentence, which is implied in the original and the reference.

Finally, the machine has used the phrase ""What is this joy to us"" in its version, while the reference text has ""What joy can we have"" - the reference is more appropriate in the context of the original sentence, as it is asking about the potential benefit of the action, not the origin of the joy.

Overall, the reference version is more faithful to the meaning and intent of the original sentence, and the machine's errors result in a less clear and less accurate rendering of the meaning.

The reference to ""Buddhism"" is unnecessary here, as it is already understood that Gautama Buddha is the founder of Buddhism.

A more accurate and clear wording for the machine-generated sentence could be ""Gautama Buddha, the prominent figure in Buddhism, departed from here in his last days."" This wording is more faithful to the original sentence and conveys the intended meaning more clearly.

The primary issue with the machine-generated text is that it is not a coherent or accurate English sentence. The phrase ""Praise et parsonage"" is nonsensical and unrelated to the intended meaning. Additionally, the reference to ""the argus poetic chapter"" is incorrect, as the reference to ""argus"" is not present in the original text.

The reference translation correctly conveys the meaning of the original text, highlighting the use of other types of verses and the presence of regret expressed by Arjuna in the first chapter.

This can be achieved by incorporating appropriate grammatical rules and ensuring that the generated sentence accurately reflects the meaning of the original text.

Vous devez en évaluer la qualité d'une traduction de népalais en anglais. Vous y parviendrez en y réfléchissant étape par étape. Lisez d'abord le texte source, la traduction automatique puis la traduction de référence. Analysez les différences entre la traduction automatique et la traduction de référence.

Texte source : यसरी दिन दिनै मखन चोरेर सताएकाले एकदिन गोपिनीहरू सबै यशोदाको घरम जम्माभएर यशोदासँग कृष्णको चुकली गरे।

Traduction automatique : Et il est venu à passer un jour donné, que Makhan a été volé, et les Gopinis s'étaient réunis tous les foyers de Jeshoda.

Traduction de référence : Un jour , tous les gopanis se sont rassemblés à la maison d'Yashoda et ont déposé une réclamation contre Krishna auprès d'Yashoda car il dérangeait en lui dérobant le beurre .

Évaluation :

La traduction automatique est assez proche de la traduction de référence, mais elle n'a pas tout à fait le même sens.

1. Utilisation des mots : Dans la traduction de référence, le mot ""réclamation"" est utilisé pour exprimer l'idée des Gopanis se réunissant pour exprimer leur mécontentement à l'égard de Krishna. Toutefois, dans la traduction automatique, le mot ""a été volé"" est utilisé pour décrire l'action, ce qui peut prêter à confusion.
2. Coordonnée temporelle : La traduction automatique ne précise pas clairement quand l'événement s'est produit, tandis que dans la traduction de référence, elle est décrite comme ayant eu lieu ""un jour"".

Note globale : 3/10

La traduction automatique ne transmet pas complètement le sens original de l'énoncé. Elle peut être améliorée en utilisant des mots qui transmettent plus fidèlement l'idée originale. De plus, une coordonnée temporelle supplémentaire peut être utile pour clarifier quand l'événement a eu lieu.

2. Noun-verb agreement: In the reference text, the verb (went) agrees in number with the subject (all the gopis), while in the machine-generated text, the verb (came) is in the third-person singular form, which does not agree in number with the plural subject (all the priesthood).

3. Consistency of style: The reference text consistently uses the English form of the proper noun (Shree Krishna, Yashoda's house) while the machine-generated text alternates between the English and the Nepali forms (Mr. Jeshoda's house).

4. Use of articles: The reference text consistently includes articles (the, a) with proper noun phrases (the gopis, Shree Krishna, a/an X's house, etc.) while the machine-generated text does not consistently use articles.

5. Use of quotation marks: The reference text consistently places proper noun phrases in quotation marks (e.g. ""Shree Krishna, ""a/an X's house"") to indicate that they refer to proper noun phrases, while the machine-generated text does not consistently use quotation marks.

Overall, the reference text is more consistent and accurate in its use of English grammatical conventions and conventions for representing proper noun phrases.

 The machine translation and reference transformation both convey the same basic meaning, but there are some differences in how they express it.

1. Word order: In the reference translation, the sentence structure is rearranged to put the main action (the King woke up) at the end for emphasis. The machine translation preserves the word order of the original Nepali sentence, resulting in a less-emphatic placement of the main action at the beginning.

2. Verb tenses: The reference translation uses past perfect tense (""had been eating"") to indicate that the action of eating was completed before the next action (the King woke up). The machine translation uses simple past tense (""ate""), which may not convey the same sense of completion.

3. Vocabulary: The reference translation uses the term ""food"" to refer to what the people in the house were eating, while the machine translation literally renders the original wording as ""all the people that were in the house were eaten"" - a wording that is confusing and inappropriate in English.

Overall, the reference translation conveys the meaning of the original sentence in a more clear and concise manner, while the machine translation is more literal and less readable.

468	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 The source text in Nepali is discussing the concept that the inherent characteristics of nature and physiology are such that physiology cannot be changed based on the pace of nature.

The machine-generated translation into English accurately conveys the idea that ""nature and physiology are different polarities,"" but mistranslates the Nepali word ""गति"" (gati), which means ""motion"" or ""speed,"" as ""speed of nature.""

The reference English translation correctly interprets ""gati"" as ""motion of nature"" and provides a clear and accurate reflection of the meaning of the original text.

Therefore, the machine-generated English text differs from the reference English text in that it incorrectly interprets the meaning of the word ""gati"" in the original Nepali.

 The source text in Nepali is: प्रतिहार ले मुलद्वार भत्काउने यिनै हुन् भनि ईसारा ग${^\wedge\wedge}यो$.

The machine translation ""And it came to pass, that Isara was gone, saying, Isara was gone."" is significantly different from the reference translation ""Pratihar hinted that they were the ones who would break down the main gate.""

The reference-level Nepali text suggests that the source text refers to an event in the past, where ""Issara gaye"" (Issara left/is gone/disappeared/moved away, depending on the context, but in this case, it seems to mean ""left/disappeared/moved away"" from the context of the reference-level English text ""Pratihar hinted that they were the ones who would break down the main gate."").

However, the machine-generated English text ""And it came to pass, that Isara was gone, saying, Isara was gone."" is not a faithful representation of the meaning of the original text. The text is not a literal translation of the source, but a rephrased version of the reference-level English text.

The primary issue with the generated English is that it is not a faithful representation of the meaning of the original text. The text ""and it came to pass"" is not a faithful representation of the meaning of the original, and the redundant ""Isara was gone, saying, Isara was gone"" is not a faithful representation of the meaning of the original.

The reference-level English is a faithful representation of the meaning of the original, and it is a more faithful representation of the meaning of the original.

Therefore, the reference-level English is a more accurate and faithful representation of the meaning of the original.

In summary, the reference-level English is a more faithful and accurate representation of the meaning of the original, and the machine-generated English is not a faithful or accurate representation of the meaning of the original.

 The source text is in Nepali and describes the areas where the residences of Chands (an assumed group of people) are primarily located.

The machine translation provided is in English but contains errors in grammar and wording. The subject of the sentence, ""The dwellings of the churches,"" is inappropriate as it does not align with the Nepali text. Additionally, the repetition of ""of the church/churches"" is unnecessary and confusing.

The reference translation, ""The residences of Chands are found mostly in three regions. These three regions are as follows,"" is a more accurate and clear English rendering of the original Nepali.

In summary, the machine-generated text differs from the reference in the following ways:

1. Incorrect subject: ""The dwellings of the churches""
2. Unnecessary and confusing repetition of ""of the church/churches""

The reference text is a more accurate and clear English rendering of the original Nepali.

 The machine translation ""As corruption and political instability increased, the maoists went through power"" slightly differs in meaning from the reference translation ""As corruption and political instability increased, the maoists became more powerful.""

The wording of the machine translation makes it sound like the maoists have left their position of power, when in fact the reference and source both indicate that the maoists gained more power or became more influential as a result of the corruption and political instability.

A more accurate and nuanced English translation of the given sentence in the provided context would be: ""With the increase in corruption and political instability, the maoists have grown in power.""

472	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 The machine translation ""These were the three generations of Satan, who were mighty men and workmen"" differs from the reference translation ""Of these three children, Shatananda was highly enlightened and brilliant in cultural practices"" in several ways.

First, the machine translation refers to ""three generations of Satan,"" while the reference translation refers to ""these three children."" The term ""generations"" implies a period of time and familial relation, while ""children"" refers to a relationship of parent and offspring.

Second, the machine incorrectly interprets the name ""Shatananda"" as a plural noun, ""Satan,"" and furthermore, it incorrectly assumes that the name refers to a group of people, not a single individual.

Financial translation services require a high level of linguistic and cultural competence, as well as an understanding of the specific context and purpose of the text. In this case, the machine failed to recognize the proper meaning of the name and incorrectly assumed a plural form, resulting in a mistranslation.

Finally, the reference translation describes the person in question as ""highly enlightened and brilliant in cultural practices,"" while the machine simply characterizes them as ""mighty men and workmen."" The reference translation provides a more nuanced and culturally appropriate depiction of the person, highlighting their wisdom and expertise, while the machine merely describes them as powerful and skilled.

In conclusion, the machine failed to accurately convey the meaning and intent of the original text, and as a result, the human reference translation is a more accurate and culturally sensitive reflection of the meaning of the original text.

The machine Translation provided is: ""Lewesk is a large follower of the motörhead musical group the three difficulties entitled music for him in WWII.""

The reference Translation provided is: ""Levesque is a great fan of the Motorhead musical group, which has given him three different entry music in WWE.""

When comparing the machine and reference Translation to the source, it is clear that the machine Translation is quite inaccurate and misses the meaning of the source.

The main issue with the machine Translation is that it confuses the proper name ""Levesk"" (which refers to a person in the original text) with the word ""lewesk"" (a fictional unit of measurement in the machine Translation that doesn't make sense in this context). Additionally, the machine Translation confuses the name of the musical group ""Motorhead"" with the word ""motörhead"" (a fictional part of a musical instrument in the machine Translation that doesn't make sense in this context).

The reference Translation, on the other hand, correctly interprets the proper name ""Levesque"" and the name of the group ""Motorhead"" and also clarifies the meaning of the text by including the information that the group gave Levesque three different ""entry"" (performance) songs in the ""WWE"" (a popular wrestling organization in the US and elsewhere).

In summary, the reference Translation is a more accurate representation of the meaning of the original text compared to the machine Translation.

474	"<s>[INST]A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, which is that Tesla and his team have stopped working on a particular project forever. However. there is a slight difference in the wording used.

In the machine-generated translation, the word ""that"" is used before the word ""project"", whereas in the reference-human translation, the word ""the"" is used.

The use of ""that"" in the machine-generated version is not incorrect, but it may sound slightly less clear or precise to a native English speaker. The word ""the"" is more commonly used in English to refer to a specific, already mentioned noun, whereas ""that"" is used to introduce a clause or to refer to a specific thing or event.

In this context, the use of ""the"" is more appropriate, as it refers to a specific project that has been previously mentioned or understood. Therefore, the reference-human version is more accurate and clear.

Overall, the difference in this case is subtle, but it highlights the importance of paying attention to nuances and word choices in translation. A minor error or variation in word usage can sometimes lead to confusion or misunderstanding, especially in more complex or specialized context.

 The machine translation ""The Nepali catalogue is also very common in religious Nepali Rock Music, and patriotic music"" is different from the reference translation ""Nepali poetry is popular in both Nepali rock music, and Western music"" in a few ways.

First, the machine translation includes the term ""religious Nepali Rock Music,"" while the reference translation only mentions ""Nepali rock music."" The addition of ""religious"" in the machine translation suggests that the music being referred to is specifically religious in nature, while the reference translation is more general in its description of the type of Nepali music.

Second. the machine translation also includes the term ""patriotic music,"" which is not present in the reference translation. The inclusion of this additional category of music in the machine translation further expands the scope of the types of music being referred to, potentially including a wider range of musical styles beyond just Nepali and Western music.

Overall, the reference translation is more concise and focused in its description of the popularity of Nepali poetry in Nepali and Western music, while the machine translation is more expansive in its inclusion of additional musical categories.

 In this case, the source text is in Nepali and needs to be translated into English. The machine.translation is ""In 1971, Ray Morgan was made the same commentator for every television games later, replacing Ray Morgan."" While the reference translation is ""In 1971, he became the commentator for every television games later replacing Ray Morgan.""

When comparing the two translations. It is clear that the machine has made some errors in the interpretation of the pronoun ""he"" in the reference text. The pronoun ""he"" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is not explicitly mentioned in the original text. However, the machine has mistakenly assumed that the subject is ""Ray Morgan"" and has translated it accordingly.

The reference text, on the other hand, has used the pronoun ""he"" correctly to refer to the subject of the sentence, which is not explicitly mentioned in the original text. Additionally, the reference text has used the verb ""become"" to indicate the change in the commentator, whereas the machine has used the verb ""was made"" that slightly alters the meaning of the sentence.

In summary, the reference text is more accurate and natural-sounding compared to the machine-generated text. The reference text has used the correct pronoun to refer to the subject and has used a more appropriate verb to convey the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English machine-generated text carefully and ensure that it conveys the intended meaning accurately.

 The machine translation seems to have some inaccuracies when compared to the reference translation. Here are some of the differences:

1. Word Selection: The machine..-translation has used ""Microcus"" and ""h's"" to refer to the proper nouns ""Michaels"" and ""H"" respectively. The reference.-translation has used the correct spelling of the proper nourishment.

2. Verb Tense: The verb tense used in the machine-translation is inconsistent. The verb ""reunited"" is in the past tense, while ""they closed down to play coruscus as a join"" is in the present tense. The reference-translation is consistent in using the.-past tense throughout.

3. Word Meaning: The phrase ""as a join"" in the machine-translation is unclear and seems to be a mistranslation. The reference-translation correctly uses ""as a coupe"" to indicate that the individuals had stopped wrestling together.

4. Overall, the reference-translation conveys the meaning of the original text more accurately and fluently. The machine-translation is difficult to understand and lacks coherence.

In summary, the machine-translation differs from the reference-translation in the areas of word-selection, verb-tense, and word-meaning. The reference-translation is a more accurate and readable representation of the original text.

2. Meaning of ""chokoma"" and ""purbima/purbima"": In the source text, ""chokoma"" is used, which means ""first"" or ""a little,"" while the machine.translation translates it as ""the first court."" Similarly, ""purbima/purbimaa"" means ""three-storied"" or ""three-storied building/s"" in English, but the machine.translation interprets it as ""shadow buildings/covered with jhingati (a type of grass or roofing material).""

3. Omission of ""bhavan"": The reference.translation specifically mentions ""three-storied hostel building/s"" (bhavan in Hindi/Nepali means a building or an institute). However, the machine.translation omits this information.

4. Mention of ""jhingati/jhingatii"": The reference.translation mentions ""jhingatii/jhingatii le/covered with jhingatii (a type of grass or roofing material)."" However, the machine.translation omits this information.

The words ""relics of the former bar of the police cell tappu"" in the machine Translation don't make sense in this context and don't appear in the source or reference Translation.

The reference Translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source, highlighting the reason for the increase in the number of tourists, which is the location of the area being the entrance to the wildlife reserve.

In comparison, the machine Translation is significantly different from the reference Translation, as it is confusing, inaccurate, and unrelated to the context of the original text.

Therefore, it is essential to use proper evaluation methods and tools to ensure the quality of the Translation, and avoid using machine Translation when a professional human Translation is required.

""When an earthquake occurs, new dangers arise from the resulting damage.""

The reference translation is very similar to the above, with the exception of using the word ""stopped"" for earthquake, which is not quite accurate. An earthquake is a natural disaster and cannot be stopped, so it would be more appropriate to say ""when an earthquake occurs"" or ""when there is an earthquake"" to convey the same meaning. Overall, the reference and the suggested revision convey the meaning of the original text more clearly and accurately.

Second. the machine translation renders ""मण्डेला स्वयमले नै भनेका छन्"" as ""is not true to be added to others, except some educational institutions."" A more accurate translation of this phrase might be ""is not appropriate or correct to link with"" or ""is not correct to relate to"" (rather than ""is not true to be added to"").

Finally, the reference and source texts use the term ""swayamle"" (swayamle in IAST transliteration, meaning ""own, related to self, or self-referred"" in Sanskrit-derived terminology used in Indic languages) to describe the type of educational institutions that can legitimately use the name ""Mandela."" The machine-generated text fails to convey this meaning, and the reference text clarifies it by stating ""except some educational institutions.""

In summary, the reference and machine-generated texts differ in the correct use of gender, the meaning of the key verb, and the clarification of the relevant institutions. A more accurate machine-generated text might be: ""But, referring to or associating his name with educational institutions other than his own is not appropriate, according to whatMandela himself said.""

2. The machine also added the name ""mercury"" to the list of visitors, which is not present in the original source.

3. The reference correctly identified the two deities mentioned in the text as ""Ram and Krishna.""

Overall, the machine's attempt at the Nepali-to-English failed to accurately reflect the intended meaning of the original text. The errors made in the first and second points significantly altered the meaning of the text, while the reference correctly conveyed the meaning. Therefore, the reference is a more accurate and reliable representation of the original text.

2. Incorrect word usage: The phrase ""For a year is ashamed"" is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense in English.

3. Meaningless repetition: The repetition of the word ""ashamed/and ashamed"" in the machine-generated text does not convey any meaning and is unnecessary.

4. Ignoring important words: The words ""tejihin"" and ""abhimanashunya"" in the original text mean ""powerless"" and ""without pride"" respectively. The machine-generated text ignores these words and does not translate them.

5. Incorrect tense: The reference text correctly uses the past tense ""kept on beditating"" to convey the meaning of the original text. However, the machine-generated text incorrectly uses the present tense ""is ashamed, and ashamed, and ashamed, and ashamed, and ashamed.""

Overall, the machine-generated text is incomprehensible and inaccurate, while the reference text conveys the meaning of the original text clearly and correctly.

1. The machine has broken down the text and translated each part separately, while the reference has kept both concepts together in one phrase.
2. The machine has translated ""प्रहरी"" as ""volunteer"" and ""विद्यालय"" as ""school"", whereas the reference has kept them as ""Hospital and School"" respectively.

The reference is a more accurate reflection of the original text, as it conveys the idea of the two entities (Hospital and School) together, whereas the machine has separated them and added unnecessary meaning to the words.

It is important to note that the reference text is also not a literal word-for-word translation, but a more nuanced and meaningful representation of the original.

In conclusion, the reference is more reflective of the intended meaning of the original, and thus, the machine's attempt falls short in comparison.

In the source text, the word used is ""timiharusanga shatruta"" (तिमीहरुसंग मेरो शत्रुता), which literally means ""adversaries to you and me/us (timi haru sanga merosatruta)."" The machine-generated text translates this as ""I have been your adversaries (ma kasari timiharuko shatru bhayo),"" which is not quite accurate. A more accurate rendering of the original text might be ""I have no adversaries towards you (ma timiharusanga shatruta chaina).""

The reference text is closer to the original, with the wording ""I don't have any enmity with you (ma timi sanga shatruta chaina).""

Overall, the reference text is more accurate and fluent in conveying the meaning of the original, while the machine-generated version contains some errors in wording and grammar.

 The machine translation ""Responsibility to be completed from political and economic directions"" differs from the reference translation ""To fulfill responsibilities from political and economic point of view"" in a few ways.

Firstly, the verb tense used in the machine translation is not consistent with the source text. The source text is in the passive voice, while the machine translation is in the imperative voice.

Secondly, the phrase ""from political and economic directions"" in the machine translation is not as clear as the reference translation. The reference translation uses the phrase ""from political and economic point of view"", which conveys the meaning more accurately.

Finally, the word ""responsibility"" in the machine translation may not fully capture the meaning of ""जिम्मेवारीलाई"" in the source text. A more appropriate translation might be ""duties and responsibilities"" or ""tasks and obligations"".

Overall, the reference translation is clearer, more accurate, and more consistent with the original source. The machine translation, while understandable, could be improved in terms of verb tense, word choice, and phrasing.

2. The reference text clarifies that the ""beams/supports"" refers to the wooden rows, but the machine-generated text does not.
3. The reference text clarifies that the wooden rows are being held in a fixed position, but the machine-generated text does not convey this meaning clearly.

Here are some of the issues with the machine translation:

1. Incorrect word choices: The machine has translated ""कोटिकोटि स्वर्णमुद्रा"" (crores of gold coins) as ""the category acquired in one of the prawns"" which is incorrect.
2. Lack of context: The machine has failed to understand the context of the sentence and has provided a literal translation of the words, leading to a nonsensical translation.

The reference Translation, on the other hand, is clear and accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, ""त्यसलाई एकएक प्रहरमा कोटिकोटि स्वर्णमुद्रा दान गरेको फल प्राप्त हुन्छ भन्ने मान्यता छ"" (It is believed that one gets the benefit of donating crores of gold coins at once). The reference text has used the appropriate words and phrases to convey the meaning of the sentence.

 The machine translation ""Whoever is sent to the Senate, considers the Senate from the quick as concerning the word"" is different from the reference translation ""The House to which a message is sent in this manner considers the matter contained in that message expeditiously as per convenience.""

The source text is in Nepali language and it states: ""जस सदनलाई कुनै सन्देश यस प्रकार पठाीिएको हो उ सदन त्यस सन्देशमा लिखे विषयमा सुविधानुसार शीघ्रताबाट विचार गर्दछ.""

A more accurate and nuanced English translation of the given source text is: ""The House. to which a message is sent in this manner, contemplates the issue mentioned in that message expeditiously, as per its convenience.""

The primary difference between the reference and machine-generated text is the meaning conveyed. The reference text is clear, precise, and accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, while the machine-generated version is vague, confusing, and does not convey the intended meaning.

The reference and the original source convey the idea that a message is sent to a particular house (sadan), and the recipients of the message consider the contents of the message expeditiously, as per the situation. However, the machine-generated version is ambiguous and lacks clarity.

Moreover, the reference and the original source use the word ""sadan"" (house or hall in English) to refer to the recipient of the message, while the machine-generated text refers to the ""Senate"" which is not accurate.

In summary, the reference and the original source convey the idea that a particular group of people (a ""sadan"" in this case) is considering the contents of a particular message expeditiously. The reference and the source convey this meaning clearly, while the machine-generated version is vague and confusing. Additionally, the reference and the original source refer to a ""sadan"" (a hall or a house in English) as the recipient of the message, while the machine-generated text refers to the ""Senate"" which is not accurate.

 The machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, but there are a few minor differences.

The source text mentions ""Vatavarnaniy Prayogkosharu"" which means ""Environmental Polluters/Contaminants/Emitters "" in Nepali. However, the machine. translation renders it as ""In Environmental Polluters "" which is not quite accurate.

The phrase in the source ""gharbhitr ra bahira duvai sthana"" literally means ""both places inside and outside of the house"" in English. The machine has translated it as ""both locations inside and outside of the house"" which is understandable but sounds slightly awkward and less fluent compared to the reference version.

The reference version renders the same concept as ""both indoors and outdoors"" which is more concise and clear.

Therefore, the reference version is more accurate and reads more naturally in English. The machine version is understandable but lacks the fluency and clarity of the reference.

 The machine translation ""There are 60 engineering and 416 associate campuses of this university"" is different from the reference translation ""This university has 60 associated and 416 affiliated campuses"".

The main difference is in the way the numbers ""60"" and ""416"" are translated. In the reference translation, these numbers are used as adjectives to modify ""campuses"" (i.e., ""60 associated campuses"" and ""416 affiliated campuses""). However, in the machine translation, the numbers are simply presented as standalone numerals.

To evaluate the quality.of the machine translation, it is important to consider whether the intended meaning of the original text has been accurately conveyed in the target language. In this case, the machine translation conveys the basic meaning of the original text, which is that the university in question is associated with 60 engineering campuses and 416 other campuses.

However, the lack of adjective-noun agreement in the machine translation could lead to confusion or misunderstanding about the relationship between the numbers and the noun ""campuses"" in the target language. Therefore, it is important to revise the machine translation to include the appropriate adjective-noun agreement, as in the reference translation.

 The source text in Nepali mentions the creation of new types of ""navaprakar"" which can be translated as ""genres"" or ""types/kinds"" in this context. The focus is on the creation of new forms or kinds of essays or compositions, which is a result of various processes such as ""sectoral specialization"", ""sectoral assimilation"", and ""cross-sectoral interface"".

The machine translation provided translates ""navaviharana pravartan"". Here, ""pravartan"" means ""creation"" or ""emergence"" and ""navaviharana"" is a passive participle form of ""navaviddhan"" which means ""new types/kinds/genres"". However, the term ""pravartanakar rup"" (which literally means ""taking the form of emergence"") is not a common or idiomatic expression and sounds unnatural in this context.

The reference English text also focuses on the emergence of new types or kinds of compositions, but it specifically mentions the concepts of ""specialization"" and ""assimilation"" in relation to ""sectors/fields/discilines"" and the concept of ""cross-sector/field/discipline interface/interaction/exchanges"".

In contrast, the machine-generated English text does not convey the same meaning as the reference English text. The concept of ""sectoral specialization"" and ""sectoral assimilation"" is not conveyed in the machine-generated text. The concept of ""cross-sector/field/discipline interface/interaction/exchanges"" is conveyed as ""blending of genres, transformations, etc.""

Overall, the reference English text conveys the meaning of the original text more accurately and naturally, and the machine-generated text is less precise and less nuanced.

The main issue with the machine translation is that it mistranslated ""समस्यामा रनभुल्ल परेकालाई"" which should mean ""to those who run into problems"" as ""to get rid of the problem"". The correct interpretation of this phrase conveys the idea that reaching the goal is simple for those who have a clear objective, but facing problems is difficult for those who encounter obstacles.

First. the machine translation translates ""मन्टेस्क्युले"" as ""montesqueul"" which is not a correct translation. The reference and source texts both use ""Montesquieu,"" which is the correct spelling and the name of the French philosopher who advocated for the separation of powers.

Second, the machine-generated text mistranslates ""शक्तिको पृथकीकरण"" as ""separation of power"" which is not an accurate rendering. A more accurate rendering would be ""separation of powers"" or ""separation of authorities.""

Finally, the machine-generated text mistranslates ""निरंकुश राजव्यवस्था"" as ""negligent royal family of France"" which is not an accurate reflection of the meaning of the term in the context of the sentence. A more accurate rendering would be ""autocratic monarchy of France"" or ""absolutist regime in France"" to convey the meaning intended in the reference and source texts.

In summary, the reference and source texts both convey the idea that the philosopher, named Montesquieu, attacked the concept of an undemocratic, centralized form of government in France, specifically an ""absolutist monarchy"" or ""autocratic regime"" through the concept of the ""separation of powers"" or ""separation of authorities."" The machine-generated text contains errors in the spelling of ""Montesquieu,"" the meaning of ""separation of powers/separation of authorities,"" and the meaning of ""absolutist/autocratic regime in France"" that make it less accurate in conveying the intended meaning.

The reference sentence suggests that the speaker is thinking or contemplating about various matters after coming back from the conference. However, the generated sentence conveys a different meaning, where the subject is playing various things together in a mansion.

The machine-generated translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, but it contains a few errors. First, it confuses ""Khayar tree"". ""Khayar tree"" is a mistransliteration of ""Khayar/Khayarko vriksha"" in the original text, which actually refers to the ""tree of Khaiar/Khayar Rishi (sage)"" in English.

Second, the machine-generated version confuses the meaning of ""Mrigashirsha nakshatra/constellation "" and incorrectly interprets it as ""Mrigashir nobility/Khaira nobility "" in English.

The reference version, on the other hand, correctly interprets the meaning of the original text and accurately interprets ""Khayar/Khayarko vriksha "" as the ""Khayar tree "" and ""Mrigashir nakshatra "" as the ""Mrigashirsha constellation "" in English.

In summary, the reference version is more accurate and closer to the meaning of the original text compared to the machine-generated version.

The machine Translation provided is: ""The closure of the western region of the tunnel can still be seen as having a great influence on them.""

The reference Translation provided is: ""Their Influence in the Western business region of Tanahun can still be seen.""

When comparing the machine and reference Translation, the main difference is that the machine Translation mentions the ""closure of the western region of the tunnel"" whereas the reference Translation mentions ""the Western business region of Tanahun""

The correct Translation of the given source is: ""Their Influence in the Western industrial area of Tanahu can still be seen ""

The source and reference Translation both refer to the same concept of Influence, but the source and machine Translation refer to the different concept of the closure of the western part of the tunnel.

The reason for this discrepancy is that the source and reference Translation refer to the same concept of Influence, but the source and machine Translation refer to the different concept of the closure of the western part of the tunnel.

The quality of the machine Translation is poor as it fails to convey the correct meaning of the original text. The reference Translation is more accurate and conveys the intended meaning of the original text.

Secondly, the reference translation states that the eliminated bonds are of the nature of ""infatuation etc."" (मोह ादि संपूर्ण बन्धनहरू नष्ट हुन), whereas the machine. trans. just says ""betrayal are destroyed"" (बिन्दु हालन हुन), which is not an accurate reflection of the intended meaning.

Finally, the reference translation is written in a more idiomatic and fluent English, while the machine. trans. is quite literal and lacks fluency.

The machine-generated target-text renders the source as follows: ""Although there were no actions immediately following the elpv, they wanted to seek a way between the rise of the Red Flag Party and the government's capitalist policy.""

The reference-translation, provided. as a reference, is rendered thus: ""Although ELPV had no immediate action plan, they wanted to find a way between the Red Flag Party's extremist left and the government's capitalist policy.""

Comparing the reference-translation and the machine-generated target-text, the following differences can be observed:

1. In the reference-translation, the source initials ""ELPV"" (in Devanagari script: ईल्पीवी) is left unchanged, while the machine-translation attempts to romanise it as ""elpv"".
2. The reference-translation renders the term ""रेड फ्ल्याग पार्टी"" (i. e. ""the Read Flag Party"") as a proper name, while the machine-generated target-text interprets it as a literal description of a phenomenon.
3. The reference-translation spells out the English loanword ""left-wing extremism"" as ""extremist left"" in the target-text, while the machine-generated target-text preserves the English loanword.

Overall, the machine-generated target-text is readable and understandable, but it differs from the reference-translation in several points, and thus, it can't be considered as an accurate and idiomatic translation. The quality of the machine-generated target-text is low, and it needs manual editing and post-editing to improve its quality and to adapt it to the specific context and register of the target text.

The correct translation of ""संयुक्त निगरानीमा"" in this context is ""joint supervision/custody/care"" as used in the reference translation. The term ""negotiations"" implies a process of discussion and bargaining, which is not the intended meaning here. The original Nepali text suggests that the children are under the joint responsibility/care of both parties after a divorce, which is better conveyed by the term ""supervision/curtody/care"" in the reference translation.

The machine translation provided is somewhat different both in structure and content. The primary issue is that the machine incorrectly interpreted ""Bhatta Brahman"". Instead of recognizing it as referring to a group of people, the system appears to have broken it apart and treated ""Bhatta Brahman"" and ""Pune"" as separate entities, leading to the inaccurate phrase ""veteran brahmins of pune."" Additionally, the reference to ""festival of the goddess"" is not included in the machine's output, and the term ""revenge;"" is used in a way that doesn't fit the context.

The reference-quality human-generated text is clearer and more accurate, capturing the original intent of the text. It mentions the specific group of people involved, the location of the worship, and the shift in the subject of their veneration.

To improve the quality of the machine-generated text, it would be necessary to incorporate the correct context and entities, as well as maintain the focus on the cultural and religious practices described in the original.

The source text specifically mentions ""devicees"" which means ""goddesses"" in Nepali. The use of ""and goddesses"" in the reference text is more inclusive and covers a wider range of deities, whereas the machine's use of ""other goddesses"" is more specific and implies that the idols made are specifically of other female deities.

Therefore. the reference and machine translations differ slightly in their level of specificity. The reference is more inclusive, while the machine is slightly more specific. Neither is incorrect, but the reference is more reflective of the original text.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""Wss service"" which does not make sense in this context. A more appropriate translation would be ""bus service"" or simply ""service,"" as used in the reference translation.

2. Word forms: The machine translation uses the verb ""vingri"" which means ""broken"" or ""defeated"" in English. However, in this context, the verb ""launched"" is more appropriate, as used in the reference translation.

3. Word order: The word order in the machine translation is jumbled and difficult to understand. A clear and concise sentence structure is preferred, as in the reference translation.

4. Meaning: Overall, the machine translation fails to convey the intended meaning of the original text, which is announcing the launch of a new bus service from Chakchake to Bhingri towards Rolpa. The reference translation is more accurate and easier to understand.

Here, the difference between the machine and reference Translation is that the reference Translation provides more context and clarity to the meaning of ""JadbuDdha/stupid."" The reference Translation makes it clear that the four sons were cursed to become stupid, whereas the machine Translation is somewhat vague and open to interpretation.

Moreover, the reference Translation is more faithful to the original source, as it preserves the meaning of the word ""JadbuDdha"" as used in Nepali culture and language, whereas the machine Translation may not be as culturally sensitive.

2. Word Order: The word order in the machine translation is also incorrect. In English, the adverb ""belonging to it"" usually comes after the noun it qualifies, but in the machine-generated text, it appears in the beginning, making the sentence hard to understand.
3. Meaning: The meaning conveyed in the machine-generated text is not accurate. The reference text conveys that the ""prince was taught the philosophy of life in his court"" but the machine-generated version suggests that ""Ruhi was taught a living vision at his palace.""

The verb ""garne thali"" in the original text has been translated as ""praised the goddess by wedding"" in the machine, but a more accurate rendering would be ""began to worship and praise the god with vedic hymns being chanted (natamastak)"".

The reference version is more faithful to the original text and conveys the intended meaning more clearly. The machine, on the other hand, contains errors in the names of the deities and the meaning of the verb, and thus fails to accurately convey the meaning of the original.

 The machine translation and reference translation both convey the same overall meaning, which is about alumni of a certain school being seen in high-level positions such as the post of minister and other high posts after the change in 2007.

However, there are some differences in the way the information is presented. The machine translation starts with ""After the change of the 2007 school not only in posts like the ministry"" which is unclear and incomplete. The reference translation provides more clarity by stating ""After the change in 2007"" which sets the context for the rest of the sentence.

The machine translation also includes the phrase ""as well as the demonstrations of this school are seen as many"" which is not present in the reference translation. for the reference translation, it is clear and concise. The phrase ""as well as the demonstrations of this school. "" is unnecessary and unclear.

In summary, while both translations convey the same meaning, the reference version is clearer, concise, and more accurate than the machine-generated one.

The reference translation is ""Kariya 12 gods of Tedi god are Raika Shahi and Khadayat"" which is closer to the original source compared to the machine generated one.

Let's evaluate the differences:

1. The machine has incorrectly identified ""Tedi"" as ""Teddy"" and has referred to it as ""The gods of Teddy are 12 ..."".
2. The reference correctly interprets ""Tedi"" as ""Tedi god"" and the ""karya 12 gaida raikaa shahi ara khadayat"" as ""12 gods of Tedi are Raika Shahi and Khadayat ""

The reference correctly understands the meaning of the words and the overall meaning of the sentence. The machine, on the other hand, has made an incorrect interpretation of the meaning of the words and the overall meaning of the sentence.

The main issue with the machine-generated translation is that it translated ""ukta nakkalī mrutyu"" as ""duplicate death"" which is not accurate. The word ""ukta"" here means ""fake or false one"" and ""nakkalī"" refers to an incident or event. The phrase ""ukta nakkalī mrutyu"" is idiomatic in Nepali and literally means a ""staged/fake death incident/event/situation"".

A more accurate and nuanced English rendering of the original text, which aligns with the reference, is: ""A story was concocted akin to a fake death situation/occurrence/event/incident/case/situation/etc.""

The reference English text ""That fake death was made like a story"" is still somewhat ambiguous and lacks the full meaning of the original. However, it is closer to the correct meaning compared to the literal machine-generated text.

1. Subject-verb agreement error: ""songs"" is plural, but the verb ""are danced"" is singular, which is incorrect.
2. Lack of clarity: ""danced to the group"" is unclear and doesn't convey the correct meaning.

The reference text conveys the meaning that in contrast to some other situation, all other songs involve dancing and singing in a group setting. The reference text emphasizes the collective activity of dancing and singing, while the machine-generated text does not convey this meaning clearly.

A more accurate and readable English version of the original text would be: ""In all other cases, the songs are danced and sung in a group setting.""

Second. the verb tense used in the machine-generated sentence is not appropriate. The verb ""garneko"" (transitioned in the source text) is translated as ""garkeko"" (transitioned) in the machine-generated sentence, but the reference sentence correctly renders it as ""garisma sacai chan"" (garisma sacai chan, lit.

Finnaly, the word ""Bhumiraj"" in the reference sentence is not present in the source sentence, but it is implied by the word ""Bhumaditya"" (lit. ""land-day/festival of the land/earth/planet "").

 The machine translation ""And the rods of fire shall be as burning in the night, and the voice of the exploding etiquette"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""At night, it is usual to seem like the flames of fire are burning, and there are sounds of explosions etc.""

The source text appears to be describing a scene at night where flames and sounds of explosions are common, creating an atmosphere of unrest or danger. The reference Translation conveys this meaning well. However, the machine Translation is incoherent and unclear.

The term ""rods of fire"" is not used in the source and is a literal translation of a term that may refer to fire or flames in general. The verb tense is also off, with the phrase ""shall be as burning"" being an awkward and unnecessary addition.

The reference to ""etiquette"" in the machine Translation is also puzzling, as it is not present in the source or the reference Translation. A better Translation of the source might be ""There are fires and sounds of explosions at night, as if they are blazing away and making noise "" or simply ""There are fires and sounds of explosions at night "" depending on the context.

The reference Translation provided is ""In addition, pisciculture was also one of the major industries of Babylon.""

When comparing the reference and machine Translation, it is clear that the machine Translation is not accurate.

2. The word ""monastery "" is used in the machine Translation, but it should be ""pisciculture/pisciculture "" as in the reference and source.

The reference and the source is consistent with each other, but the machine Translation is not. The word ""pisciculture/pisciculture "" is replaced by ""monastery "" in the machine Translation, which is incorrect.

 Both the machine and reference translations convey the same basic meaning, which is to seek help from experienced women when facing issues with breastfeeding. However, there are some differences in the way they are phrased.

The machine-generated translation uses the phrase ""if the problem is caused by breastfeeding"" which is not an exact translation of the original Nepali sentence. A more accurate translation would be ""while breastfeeding.""

The reference Translation uses the phrase ""while breastfeeding"" which is a closer translation of the original Nepali sentence.

Moreover, the machine-generated Translation uses the word ""assistance"" which is formal and could be replaced with ""help"" which is more commonly used and sounds more natural in English.

The reference Translation uses the word ""other experienced women"" which is closer to the original Nepali sentence that uses the term ""any experienced women"".

In summary, while both the machine and reference Translations convey the same basic meaning, the reference Translation is more accurate and natural-sounding in English. The machine-generated Translation can be improved both in terms of accuracy and fluency.

The machine-generated translation ""Samweed's olive shlok has enjoyed a history of excellence and excellence"" is significantly different from the reference translation ""The Bhadra verse of the Sama Veda elaborates the story of Maharshi Gautam 's excellence and wisdom ""

Here are some of the issues with the machine-generated:

1. The machine-generated version confusingly refers to ""Samweed's olive shlok "" which is not mentioned or implied in the original text.
2. The phrase ""a history of excellence and excellence "" is vague and doesn't convey the meaning of the original.

The reference version, on the other hand, correctly identifies the text as a ""verse "" and clarifies that it is from the ""Sama Veda "" and that it elaborates the ""excellence and wisdom "" of ""Maharshi Gautam ""

In summary, the reference version is clear, accurate, and closely aligned with the meaning of the original, while the machine-generated is confusing, vague, and far off the intended meaning.

One inaccuracy in the machine translation is the use of the present continuous tense ""is held"" instead of the simple present tense ""is celebrated"" in the reference translation. Celebrating an event. such as a memorial day, is a recurring annual activity, so the simple present tense is more appropriate.

Another issue in the machine translation is the word order. In the English language, the adverbial phrase ""on January 30"" usually comes after the main verb, whereas in the machine translation, it appears at the beginning of the sentence.

Here are some of the issues with the machine translation:

1. Incorrect Gender: The source text uses the term ""Shristhan"" which refers to a specific location in Nepal. The machine incorrectly translates this as ""Mr. Space"" which is not only inappropriate but also incomprehensible.

Solution: The correct term for ""Shristhan"" in English is ""Shristhana"".

2. Word Selection: The term ""panchakoshi"" in the source text refers to a region in Nepal that is known for its five main religious and cultural centers. The machine incorrect.ly interprets this as ""panchkoshi agency"" which is not only inappropriate but also unrelated to the context.

Solution: A better translation for ""panchakoshi"" in this context is ""the region of the five main centers/places of pilgrimage/culture/religion etc.""

3. Sentence structure: The sentence structure in the machine-generated text is awkward and difficult to understand.

Solution: A clear and straightforward sentence such as ""Shristhan is one of the five main centers/places of the Panchakoshi region"" is more appropriate and readable.

1. Incorrect translation. The term ""तसर्थ गणेशजीको गजवदन प्राप्त bhayo"" means ""Ganesha's elephant head was received/gained popularity"" in English. However, the machine...

2. Incorrect usage of words. The word ""meshazi"" in the machine-generated text seems to be a spelling mistake and should be ""mesozoic era's"" or ""in the middle ages.""

3. Lack of fluency. The sentence ""but the honeymoon of hunan increased in the middle age tradition"" is not fluent and does not convey the meaning of the reference text.

4. Incorrect word forms. The word ""hunan"" in the machine-generated text is a spelling mistake and should be ""Hanuman"" in English.

5. Lack of consistency. The reference text mentions ""Ganesha's Gajavadan was received"" but the machine-generated text mentions ""the honeymoon of hunan increased in the middle-age tradition.""

The reference text conveys the meaning that the elephant head of Ganesha was received/gained popularity, and the importance of Hanuman increased in the medieval tradition. However, the machine-generated text lacks fluency, contains incorrect spellings, and in some instances, incorrectly interprets the meaning of the original text. Therefore, the reference text is a more accurate and reliable representation of the original text compared to the machine-generated text.

The reference translation correctly identifies the specific colors used in Holi as red, green, yellow, and blue. The machine translation, however, simply states that red, green, yellow, and blue colors are ""more commonly used"" but does not specify the context in which these colors are commonly used.

The primary difference is in the wording of the phrases used to express the variation. The machine. transformation uses ""lyrics of the songs...differed"" while the reference transformation uses ""rhythm and language...vary.""

The word ""lyrics"" used in the machine. transformation is not an exact translation of the original Nepali word ""नियमहरूमा"" (niyamaharūmā), which means ""rules or regulations."" The reference transformation correctly translates this to ""rhythm and language"" to convey the meaning of the original text.

Moreover, the word ""songs"" is not explicitly mentioned in the original text, but implied in the context. The reference translation correctly inferred this and included it in the final sentence, but the machine. transformation did not.

Overall, the reference transformation is more accurate and closely conveys the meaning of the original text compared to the machine. transformation. The reference transformation is more nuanced and precise, while the machine. transformation oversimplifies the meaning and loses the richness of the original text.

The machine and reference translations both convey the main idea of the text, but they differ in their wording and phrasing.

The machine-generated translation ""when he defeated the Kathmandu Kingdom, which was ruled by the kingdom of Jaipur"" is inaccurate.

However, the machine translation renders this as ""6.3 % of the logging population was identified as COPD, in a total of 15 million people.""

The reference text, on the other hand, accurately reflects the meaning of the original text, stating ""In the United States, 6.3% of the logging population, about 1.5 million people, was identified with COPD.""

The key difference here is that the reference text accurately conveys the number of people identified with COPD, whereas the machine text simply states that 15 million people were involved, but does not specify the exact number of people with COPD.

Overall, the reference text is a more accurate and faithful representation of the meaning of the original text.

1. The source text is about the practice of ""satkarmā"" and ""sadvicār"" (a term from Hinduism and Buddhsim meaning ""good deeds"" and ""good thoughts"" respectively) and the mental stability and passion associated with it.

The machine-generated English version, however, seems to have strayed away from the intended meaning, and introduced the idea of ""survival and sadness"" that is not present in the original.

2. The reference English version is more faithful to the meaning of the original, and it clearly expresses the idea of ""the more we meditate on good deeds and good thoughts, the more we have mental stability and a passion for good deeds and good thoughts.""

In contrast, the machine-generated text is less clear and less precise, and it does not convey the meaning as effectively.

Overall, the reference English version is more accurate and effective in conveying the meaning of the original, and it serves as a better guide for evaluating the quality of a Nepali-to-English text.

Here are the specific differences:

1. Location: The machine translation says ""the town's school,"" while the reference. translation says ""village schools.""
2. Agencies: The machine translation combines ""government"" and ""non-profit offices/organizations"" together, while the reference breaks them out separately.

To improve the quality of the machine-generated Nepali-to-English text, it is important to consider the nuances of the words and phrases in the original language.

1. For the first difference, the word ""गाउँको"" (gaun-ko) in the original text means ""of the village/villages/area/place/town/etc."" In this context, it is clear that the original text refers to ""village/rural"" areas, so the reference's ""village schools"" is a better fit.

2. For the second difference, the source separates ""government offices/departments/agencies/entities/organizations/institutions/bureaus/ministries, etc."" and ""non-government/non-official/non-state/private/civil/sector/community/NGO, etc."" in the target.

To improve the quality of the machine-generated text, the corrected version of the sentence is:

The source text is in Nepali, and it appears to be referring to a person who can write something (perhaps a text or a song) in a way that is both accurate and free of errors, just like the legendary sage Vyas. The reference translation captures this meaning well, as it mentions the ability of someone to write something ""without mistake exactly how Vyas would recite it.""

However, the machine translation is incomplete and lacks clarity. The reference to ""those who were wrong with no contradiction"" is unclear and confusing, and it is not clear what the phrase ""as they knew the interest"" is intended to mean. Additionally, the overall structure and grammar of the sentence are awkward and difficult to follow.

Compared to the reference translation, the machine translation is less clear, precise, and coherent.

The machine and reference translations both convey the same overall meaning, but there are some differences in wording and phrasing. Here are some specific differences to consider:

1. The machine and reference use different spellings of the name ""McMahon/Mcmain.""
2. The reference explicitly states that the subject of the sentence (McMahon/Mcmain) did not want to see ""his/her"" treatment of Austin, while the machine simply states that the subject did not want to see ""rhyming as a WWF World Winner.""

However, the machine mistranslates this as ""the echo era,"" which is completely unrelated to the meaning in the source.

Overall, the reference version is more accurate and a better representation of the meaning in the source compared to the machine. The reference is more nuanced and preserves the meaning of the original text, while the machine oversimplifies and sometimes completely misses the meaning.

The source text is in Nepali and it states: ""तर न त माओवादी जनयुद्ध रोकियो न त दलहरूबीच नै सहमति बन्न सakYo.""

A more accurate English translation of the given source text in English is: ""The Maoist insurgency was not stopped, and neither have the parties come to an agreement.""

* The source mentions ""Maoist insurgency"" which is referred to as ""mahavad"" in the Nepali language.
* The source mentions ""the parties"" which is referred to as ""dalharu"" in the Nepali language.

The reference and the accurate English translation convey the same meaning, but the machine-generated text differs significantly. The primary issue with the machine-generated text is that it is not coherent and lacks proper sentence structure. The words ""not"" and ""the maiden"" are used inappropriately and repeatedly, and the reference to ""the companies"" is not mentioned in the original text. Additionally, the verb tenses used in the machine-generated text are inconsistent and incorrect.

Machine Translation: Improvements in administration initiated such as the establishment of a population service commission and swat judiciary.

Reference Translation: The trend like establishment of Public Service Commision after reforms in administration and independent judiciary.

The machine and reference English translations differ in several ways.

1. In the reference translation, the word ""trend"" is used to describe the establishment of the Public Service Commission and independent judiciary, while the machine has translated it as ""improvements in administration initiated such as"".

2. The reference has used the word ""reforms"" to describe the administrative changes, but the machine has used the phrase ""improvements in administration initiated"".

3. The reference mentions the establishment of an ""independent judiciary"" while the machine has used the term ""swat judiciary"" which is not accurate.

Overall, the reference English version conveys the meaning of the original text in a more clear and precise manner as compared to the machine-generated version. The reference has used more appropriate and accurate words to convey the meaning of the text. The machine-generated version, on the other hand, contains some errors and lacks clarity in some places.

 The machine translation and reference translation share the same general meaning, but the wording and structure are quite different. The source text is in Nepali, which differs significantly from English both in grammar and vocabulary.

The source sentence:
""जुन ठाउँको पानी र माटोको तौल बराबर हुन्छ त्यही ठाउँ उत्तम हुन्छ भанे त्यस्तो ठाउँ खोज्दै हिड्ने क्रममा बान्नी आइपुगेका थिए ।""

The machine-generated text:
""The place which is equal to the weight of the water and of the clay, which is bestowed upon it, that the Banni came to pass through.""

The reference text:
""Banni had come while searching for a place saying that the place where the weight of the water and the soil is equal, is the best.""

The primary difference between the two translations is that the machine-generated one is more literal and closer to a word-for-word rendering, whereas the reference version conveys the meaning in a more cohesive and coherent manner.

The source sentence mentions ""जुन ठाउँ"" (the place) and the reference version identifies it as ""a place for Banni to come and search for it/him/her/them/it (बान्नी आइपुगेका थिए).""

The source and reference share the idea that the place is being compared to the combined weight of the soil and the water, but the reference is more explicit in conveying the purpose of the comparison, which is to find the best (most suitable) location.

The reference also clarifies the agent of the action, attributing it to ""Banni (Banni)"" and the purpose of the action, ""to search for a place (बान्नी आइपुगेका थिए).""

The machine-generated version lacks this clarity, and the meaning of the sentence is less apparent.

In summary, the reference is more readable, clear, and precise in conveying the meaning of the original sentence, while the machine-generated one is more literal and less clear.

Second. ""halako aishwarya yukta ra vaihavpurn aavasthaa dekhdai kati raaja tafark daina bhane chainaa bhana"" in the source text has been translated as ""and to the queen if he didn't return to the kingdom anymore, when he saw the current hierarchy and the imperial state"" in the machine Translation. A more accurate Translation would be ""and to the queen, upon seeing the prosperous and grand state, got worried that the he might not return ""

Here are some of the issues with the machine's attempt at a literal translation:

1. ""goes on to match the special guest from the state of Rahu with such a treacherous guilt"" is a very awkward and confusing phrasing in English.
2. ""treacherous guilt"" is not an appropriate or clear way to convey the meaning of the original text, which is referring to a ""dosha-rahita sthiti"" or ""flawless position of Rahu"" in the original text.
3. The reference to a ""guest"" in the machine's attempt at a literal translation is not present in the original text, and is likely a result of a misunderstanding of the word ""tyasto"" in the original text, which means ""but, however, or yet.""

In contrast, the reference translation conveys the meaning of the original text clearly and accurately, with the use of the phrase ""flawless position of Rahu"" to convey the meaning of ""dosha-rahita sthiti"" and the phrase ""special auspicious results"" to convey the meaning of ""shubhfalas"" in the original text.
