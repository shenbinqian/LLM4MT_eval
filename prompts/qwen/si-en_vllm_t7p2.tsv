A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: හැම දැයෙහි මිදුණා වූ කසුප් බුදුරජුනට නමස්කාර වේ වා.
Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Every frost is named for the Ksupp Buddha.
Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Praise be to the Buddha who is saved in all things.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text talks about ""මිදුණා"" (frost) being named for ""කසුප් බුදුරජුන"" (a specific Buddha), while the machine translation translates ""මිදුණා"" as ""every frost"" and ""කසුප් බුදුරජුන"" as ""the Ksupp Buddha.""
- The source text uses ""නමස්කාර"" (praise) which is not directly translated in the machine translation, but rather implies a naming or association.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text by translating ""හැම"" (every) as ""in all things"" and ""මිදුණා"" as ""saved"" (implied in ""saved in all things"").
- The reference translation also adds the missing ""praise"" aspect by saying ""Praise be to the Buddha.""

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- It does not capture the implied praise in the source text.
- It translates ""මිදුණා"" (frost) as ""every frost"" instead of the more specific ""saved"" or ""protected"" in the context.
- It omits the ""praise"" aspect, which is present in the source text.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should convey the praise and the specific association of the frost with the Buddha, rather than translating it as a general statement about every frost.

|Source: උදාහරණයක් වශයෙන් කුඩා ළමයා තම ලිංගය ස්පර්ශ කිරීමට කැමතිය.|
|Machine translation: For example, the little kid likes to touch his dick.|
|Reference translation: For example, a small child likes to touch his penis.|

Analysis:
1. The source text is in Sinhala, a language spoken in Sri Lanka, and discusses a child's action of touching their genitalia.
2. The machine translation mistranslates ""අමයා"" (little amaya) as ""the little kid"" or ""dick"" (which is not accurate in this context). In Sinhala, ""අමයා"" is a colloquial term for a young boy, and it's not a direct translation for ""dick"" or ""penis.""
3. The machine translation also uses ""dick"" which is a slang term in English, while the reference translation uses ""penis,"" which is a more appropriate and formal term for a child's genitalia.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the choice of words and cultural appropriateness. The machine translation should have used ""අමයා"" as a reference to a young boy and ""penis"" instead of ""dick"" to maintain accuracy and cultural sensitivity.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: ""In this way lectured intelligence on the menace, originally to come to pinnacle determination.""

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: ""Meditate on the Buddha Dhamma as preached in this manner to truly gain merit and attain Nirvana.""

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the meaning of the source text. It translates ""දේශනාකරන"" (preaching) as ""lectured intelligence"" and ""අමතකාගමනය"" (attaining Nirvana) as ""pinnacle determination,"" which are not accurate.
- The reference translation correctly captures the idea of meditating on the Buddha Dhamma and the connection to gaining merit and attaining Nirvana.
- The source text also mentions the method of ""මෙමාගාරය"" (this manner), which is not directly translated in the machine translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the meaning and context. It incorrectly translates key phrases and concepts, while the reference translation accurately conveys the message of meditating on the Buddha Dhamma for spiritual growth.

Machine translation: In 494 its balance was absorbed by goguryeo.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In 494 its remnants were absorbed by Goguryeo.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""balance"" which is not directly translated from the source text. The source text refers to ""අවශෝෂණය"" (absorption), which is a more general term than balance.
- The machine translation omits the word ""අවශෝෂණය"" (absorption) entirely, which is a crucial part of the meaning.
- The reference translation uses ""remnants"" which is a more accurate translation of ""අවශෝෂණය"" than ""balance.""
- The reference translation capitalizes ""Goguryeo,"" which is likely a proper noun referring to a specific historical entity, while the machine translation does not.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the word choice (using ""balance"" instead of ""remnants"" or ""absorption"") and the capitalization of ""Goguryeo."" The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the source text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: In the ears here, the mansion hole is made of large penetrating jewelry.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Here, large plug shaped ornaments are put into the fleshy hole in the earlobe.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text refers to ""මාංසලමය"" (fleshy hole in the earlobe), while the machine translation translates it as ""mansion hole"" which is not accurate.
- The source text uses ""විශාල"" (large) to describe the size of the ornaments, which is correctly translated in both the machine and reference translations.
- The source text mentions ""පැළඳීම"" (putting in), while the machine translation uses ""made of"" which does not convey the same action.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation accurately captures the action of putting large ornaments into the fleshy hole, which is ""putting in"" (පැළඳීම).
- The reference translation uses ""plug shaped"" to describe the ornaments, which is not directly in the source text but a reasonable interpretation based on the context.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its description of the ""mansion hole"" and the action of the ornaments. The reference translation is more accurate in terms of the context and the action of placing large ornaments in the earlobe.

|Machine translation: By contrast with the royal yi house, the Andong Kim clan had contested hundreds of power.
|Reference translation: The Andong Kim dynasty had strengthened its power by intermarrying with the royal house.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""අන්දොං කිම් වංශය"" (Andong Kim clan) and ""අන්තර්විවාහ"" (intermarriage) as the method by which they gained power.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අන්තර්විවාහ"" as ""contested hundreds of power,"" which is a literal and incorrect interpretation. It should convey the idea of intermarriage to strengthen their position.
3. The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text by stating that the Andong Kim dynasty ""strengthened its power by intermarrying with the royal house.""

To improve the machine translation, it should be revised to: ""The Andong Kim clan strengthened its power through intermarriage with the royal house.""

Step 2: Identify the difference in translation.
The machine translation omits the word ""අවස්ථාවේ"" (Especially) from the source, which is crucial to convey the emphasis on the offices in question.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: ""Also 36 offices in other offices contributed""
Reference translation: ""Also, 36 officers from other offices contributed""

Step 4: Analyze the difference.
The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අවස්ථාවේ"" as ""in other offices"" instead of specifying ""officers"" as in the reference translation. This changes the meaning, as the reference implies that the 36 individuals are officers who contributed, not just any offices.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of emphasis and clarity. It misses the crucial word ""අවස්ථාවේ"" and does not specify that the 36 individuals are officers, which affects the meaning and quality of the translation.

|Machine translation: The daughters of the kings of karthik and siddhartha|
|Reference translation: The daughters of kings Kavantissa and Saddhatissa|

1. **Comparison**: The source text mentions two specific kings, ""කාවන්තිස්ස"" (Kavantissa) and ""සද්ධාතිස්ස"" (Saddhatissa), while the machine translation combines their names into a single term ""karthik and siddhartha,"" which is not accurate.

2. **Translation of names**: The machine translation mistranslates the proper names, which are important cultural and historical references.

3. **Action**: The source text uses ""වී"" (vī, meaning ""to live"" or ""to be"") after the names, which implies that the daughters were alive or present in some context. The machine translation, however, uses ""executed"" (which is ""අවශයා"" in Sinhala), which is a different action and does not match the source.

4. **Reference translation**: The reference translation accurately translates the names and the action as ""ordained"" (අධිශ්ශීලාවේන්), which is a more suitable term for the context, as it often refers to ordination of Buddhist nuns.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of proper name handling, action description, and cultural context. The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Its defeated enemy is portrayed with ruined scenes.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: It is adorned with pictures of defeated enemies.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""ruined scenes"" to describe the defeated enemy, while the reference translation uses ""pictures"" or ""images"" (alankaara in Sinhala).
- The machine translation implies that the defeated enemy is being depicted in a state of destruction, whereas the reference translation suggests a more decorative or artistic representation.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality
The machine translation is not entirely accurate in capturing the meaning of the source text, as it changes the imagery from a visual representation (pictures) to a damaged setting (ruined scenes). The reference translation better conveys the idea of the defeated enemy being presented in a way that is likely to be artistic or symbolic.

Conclusion: The machine translation could be improved by using ""pictures"" or ""images"" instead of ""ruined scenes"" to align more closely with the original meaning in the source text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: And the facade begins to be more than the rest of the body.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Also, the face begins to swell more than any other part of the body.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation refers to ""the facade"" which is not present in the source text. The source text talks about ""අනික් තැනක"" (a part of the body, likely the face) and ""වඩා"" (more than), not a facade.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""අනික් තැනක"" as ""any other part of the body"" and uses ""swell"" to convey the idea of ""වඩා"" (more than) in the context of the body.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The main difference is the translation of ""අනික් තැනක"" as ""facade"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect. The correct translation should be ""face.""
- The reference translation captures the intended meaning of ""වඩා"" (more than) in the context of the body, while the machine translation does not.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the incorrect identification of ""අනික් තැනක"" as ""facade"" and the lack of a clear translation for the concept of ""more than"" in the context of body swelling. The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text.

The difference here is that the machine translation is using ""built"" (වැසිමීති) which implies a construction process, while the reference translation uses ""consisted"" (සමන්විත) which refers to the composition or makeup of something. The source text is talking about the connection or association of these cottages, not their physical construction.

|Source: පසු අවධියේ |
|Machine translation: in the later period its community foundation is wide |
|Reference translation: later on its social base expanded |

The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අවධියේ"" (which means ""in the later period"" or ""subsequently"") as ""its community foundation is wide."" The reference translation correctly captures the idea of expansion, using ""expanded"" (පදනම් පුළුල්වේ), which implies growth or development.

Overall, the machine translation loses the nuance of the original text, focusing on the physical aspect of the cottages being built rather than their social context, and incorrectly interpreting the expansion of the community foundation.

Step 3: Identify differences
- The machine translation omits the word ""cube"" and the emphasis on the small size, which is important in the context.
- The machine translation uses ""capacity"" instead of ""ice cube,"" which changes the meaning from a specific object to a more general concept.
- The phrase ""true existence"" in the source text is translated as ""truly called"" in the machine translation, which loses the emphasis on the reality of the object.

Step 4: Compare with the reference translation
Reference translation: Besides minerals, think if there is something truly called an ice cube here.
- The reference translation captures the idea of considering an ice cube specifically, as well as the context of minerals.

- The machine translation omits the word ""අතිරේක"" (atirek), which means ""anyone"" or ""every person"" in Sinhala. The reference translation includes this, making it clearer that the statement applies to all individuals.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the choice of words (""strength"" vs. ""power"") and the inclusion of ""අතිරේක"" to emphasize that the statement applies to everyone. The overall meaning is similar, but the reference translation is more precise and idiomatic.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: මෙසේ තාවකාලිකව යටපත් කරන්නා වූ දේවල් අවිඥානය තුළ සැගවී තිබේ.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Table of contemporary undertakings is hidden in arithmetic.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Things that are thus temporarily suppressed are hidden in the awichnaya.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text talks about ""මෙසේ තාවකාලිකව"" (contemporary) and ""දේවල්"" (devel or something that is suppressed), which refers to a situation where something is temporarily held back.
- The machine translation translates ""දේවල්"" as ""contemporary undertakings"" and ""අවිඥානය"" as ""arithmetic,"" which is a misinterpretation of the original meaning.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of ""අවිඥානය"" as ""awichnaya,"" which likely refers to a hidden or suppressed state, as in the source text.
- The reference translation also uses ""things that are thus temporarily suppressed"" to convey the idea of suppression, which is more accurate than the machine translation's ""contemporary undertakings.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it incorrectly translates ""අවිඥානය"" as ""arithmetic"" and misses the context of suppression, while the reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text by using ""awichnaya"" and describing the situation as ""temporarily suppressed.""
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

|Machine translation:| The Jewish life in the Christian country often consisted of blood libels, neopaganism, inspiration, and censorship.
|Reference translation:| Jewish life in Christian lands was often marked by blood libels, exile, coercion, and genocide.

|Analysis:|
1. **Blood libels**: Both translations mention ""blood libels"", which is consistent.
2. **Exile**: The machine translation omits ""exile"" (නෙරපා), which is present in the reference translation. This is a significant difference as it is an important aspect of the context.
3. **Coercion**: The machine translation uses ""inspiration"" (鼓舞), which is not equivalent to ""coercion"" (压迫) in the reference translation. This is a mistranslation.
4. **Genocide**: The machine translation does not include ""genocide"", which is a crucial term in the reference translation, indicating the extreme violence against Jews.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the exclusion of ""exile"" and the incorrect translation of ""coercion"" as ""inspiration"". The absence of ""genocide"" is another significant issue, which is a key point in the reference text. The overall meaning and severity of the situation are not accurately conveyed by the machine translation.

|Machine translation: In addition to the fragmented ears of many fantasy calculations, a sign of weird life.|
|Reference translation: In addition, pointed ears are a feature of many fantasy mystical creatures.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""මීට"" (ears) and ""කන්"" (of many), which refers to the ears of creatures in a fantasy context.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අමතරව"" (in addition to) as ""in addition to the fragmented ears"", which adds a new meaning and implies that the ears are broken or not whole, which is not the intended meaning.
3. The machine translation also adds ""of many fantasy calculations"" which is not present in the source text. It seems to be a misinterpretation, as the context is about creatures, not calculations.
4. The machine translation further describes the ""life"" as ""weird"", which is not found in the source or reference translation. It's possible that the intended meaning is ""fantasy"" or ""mystical"" creatures, which is more accurate in the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation deviates from the source text in terms of accurately conveying the meaning of ""අමතරව"" (in addition to), the reference to ears being a feature, and the description of the creatures as ""මීට"" (ears) rather than ""අමතරව"" (additional).

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: එලවළු සලාද සෑදීමට යොදාගන්නා බැවින් මෙම නම ලැබී ඇත.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: This name has been used to create vegetable salads.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The name comes from the fact that it is used to make vegetable salads.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""This name has been used to create vegetable salads,"" which implies a past action and a focus on the result (creation of salads).
- The reference translation, on the other hand, explains the origin or reason for the name, saying ""The name comes from the fact that it is used to make vegetable salads,"" which emphasizes the purpose for which the name is used.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation does not explicitly mention the ""fact"" or the reason behind the name, which is present in the reference translation.
- The reference translation provides a clearer context by connecting the name to the act of making vegetable salads, while the machine translation focuses more on the action of using the name.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in that it does not clearly convey the reason for the name, which is the primary focus in the reference. The reference translation provides a more accurate reflection of the source text's meaning by emphasizing the connection between the name and the use in making vegetable salads.

Step 1: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- ""නමුත් වසැ"" (Thutmose IV)
- ""අයි"" (it)
- ""අපිට"" (to it)
- ""පසු IVවන"" (after Thutmose IV)
- ""අයි"" (it)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""But thirty five years later IV was not satisfied until it was relocated.""
- Reference translation: ""But it was not planted until thirty-five years later by Thutmose IV.""

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""was not satisfied"" which does not directly correspond to the planting action in the source text. The reference translation uses ""was not planted.""
2. The machine translation omits the name ""Thutmose IV"" and instead refers to ""IV"" without context, while the reference translation includes it.
3. The machine translation uses ""relocated"" as a general term, while the reference translation specifies that it was ""by Thutmose IV"" that the action took place.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the action (planting vs. satisfaction), the inclusion of Thutmose IV's name, and the specificity of the relocation. The reference translation provides a more accurate translation of the source text, maintaining the context and the subject matter.

|Machine translation: Ancient recent religions mesopotamian ancient history of Mesopotamia, lion of Babylon|
|Reference translation: Ancient Oriental Religions Mesopotamian Mythology History of Mesopotamia The Lion of Babylon|

Analysis:
1. **""පුරාතන""** (ancient) in the source is translated as ""Ancient recent"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect. The correct translation should be ""Ancient Oriental"" as it refers to the ancient religions of the Orient, not recent.
2. **""මෑත""** (religions) is translated as ""religions"" in both, which is accurate.
3. **""පෙරදිග""** (Mesopotamian) is translated as ""mesopotamian"" in both, which is correct.
4. **""අගම්""** (history) is translated as ""ancient history"" in both, which is accurate.
5. **""නු""** (of) is not included in the machine translation, which is a minor omission.
6. **""පුරාණෝක්තිවේදය""** (mythology) is translated as ""Mesopotamia, lion of Babylon"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect. The correct translation should be ""Mesopotamian Mythology"" to convey the context of the ancient mythology of Mesopotamia.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in the following aspects:
- Incorrect translation of ""පුරාතන"" as ""Ancient recent"" instead of ""Ancient Oriental.""
- Missing the word ""නු"" which is important for connecting the two phrases.
- Incorrect interpretation of ""පුරාණෝක්තිවේදය"" as ""Mesopotamia, lion of Babylon"" instead of ""Mesopotamian Mythology.""

The corrected machine translation should be: ""Ancient Oriental Religions Mesopotamian Mythology History of Mesopotamia The Lion of Babylon"" to match the reference translation.

|Reference translation: So it was easy to fight the Hyksos in the north and the Nubians in the south.

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""හික්සොස්වරුන්"" (Hyksos), a historical Egyptian term for a group of invaders, not ""hicksons"" or ""döbians,"" which are incorrect translations.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""දකුණින්"" (Nubians) as ""döbians,"" which is a mistranslation of a different ethnic group.

1. **Source analysis**: The source text in Sinhala discusses ""විවිධ කාර්යයන්ට"" (various tasks) and ""ගැනෙන දෘඩාංග"" (specific functions or aspects), which implies that the focus is on particular functions related to different tasks.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation states ""A number of hardware catalogs about various tasks are assembled."" This suggests that the machine has interpreted the source as a collection of catalogs, which is not the same as the specific functions or aspects mentioned in the source.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation, ""A number of hardware functions have been frozen and assembled,"" indicates that the focus is on functions that have been combined or fixed, which aligns better with the idea of ""දෘඩාංග"" in the source.

4. **Difference**: The main difference lies in the interpretation of ""දෘඩාංග"" in the source. The machine translation assumes it refers to catalogs, while the reference translation understands it as functions. The reference also adds the concept of ""frozen"" which is not directly present in the source but could be an interpretation of ""ගැනෙන"" (related to or for).

Conclusion: The machine translation is not accurate in capturing the essence of the source text, as it incorrectly translates ""දෘඩාංග"" as ""catalogs"" and misses the concept of ""frozen"" functions. The reference translation, on the other hand, better aligns with the source by focusing on specific functions related to different tasks.

- The machine translation uses ""finish"" (අවසන්) while the reference translation uses ""end"" (end). Although these words are similar in meaning, ""end"" is more appropriate in this context as it implies a conclusion to the investigation.
- The machine translation adds ""and save"" after ""finish the investigation,"" while the reference translation omits this and uses ""there by"" (there by) to connect the two actions, which is a more natural way to express the result in Sinhala.

Step 5: Conclusion

1. **Source**: The source text discusses the possibility of an economic crisis leading to problematic political conditions and questions whether the ""panths"" (a term that might refer to social classes or groups) lose their leadership in such a scenario.
2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""ගැටලූකාරී"" (problematic) as ""chronic"" leadership, which does not convey the intended meaning of the original text. It also uses ""definitely"" to describe the escape from leadership, which is not present in the source.
3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation correctly captures the idea that an economic crisis can lead to problematic politics but emphasizes that the loss of traditional leadership is not an automatic outcome.

|Reference translation: The prepared alms were distributed to the poor beggars in the city|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""පිළියෙල"" (piliyel), which is a Sinhala word that likely means ""cooked food"" or ""prepared alms"" in the context of charity.
2. ""කල"" (kal) is a Sinhala word that can mean ""cooked"" or ""prepared,"" which supports the interpretation of ""piliyel"" as food.
3. ""දානය"" (danyaya) means ""alms"" or ""charity"" in Sinhala.
4. ""නගරයෙහි"" (nagarahehi) means ""in the city.""
5. ""වූ"" (vu) is a connector, but its meaning is not clear in this context. It might be a typo or a less common word.

- It omits the word ""අල්ම්"" (almya) or ""අල්ම්වා"" (almyawa), which is crucial for the meaning of the sentence.

|Machine translation: The eggs that have been laid on a fertile mud floor are deposited except for the oldest existence.|
|Reference translation: When sown in fertile mud, the eggs hatch and the plant emerges and leaves its oldest existence.|

Analysis:

1. **Sinhala to English translation of the source sentence:**
   - ""සරු"" (saru) means ""sown"" or ""planted""
   - ""මඩ"" (mada) refers to ""mud""
   - ""බිමක"" (bimaka) means ""eggs""
   - ""වැපිරූ"" (wapiru) means ""laid""
   - ""කල"" (kal) is a past tense marker, indicating ""have been""
   - ""බිත්තර"" (bitthar) means ""except""
   - ""විඇට"" (viet) is a verb, but its meaning is not clear in this context
   - ""පුපුරා"" (pupura) is a term that could refer to ""deposit"" or ""depositing""
   - ""පැළපත"" (pelapata) means ""emerges""
   - ""නැගී"" (negi) means ""except""
   - ""පැරණිම"" (peranim) is a term that could mean ""oldest existence""
   - ""පැවතුම"" (pewativum) means ""remains"" or ""stays""
   - ""හැර"" (har) is a verb, but its meaning is not clear in this context
   - ""දමයි"" (dami) is a verb, which could mean ""happens"" or ""occurs""

2. **Comparison:**
   - The machine translation attempts to convey the idea that eggs are deposited on fertile mud, but it incorrectly translates ""විඇට"" (viet) as ""deposited"" and omits the context of sowing or planting. It also incorrectly translates ""හැර"" (har) and ""දමයි"" (dami), which might be a verb related to the process but are not accurately translated.
   - The reference translation captures the essence of the source sentence better by translating ""වැපිරූ"" (wapiru) as ""hatch"" and ""හැර"" (har) as ""emerges,"" which fits the context of a plant growing from eggs. It also maintains the idea of leaving the oldest existence.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the verb choices, the context of sowing/hatching, and the overall structure, which results in a less accurate representation of the original Sinhala sentence. The reference translation better captures the meaning and the process described in the source text.

|ලැබී| | to obtain|
|තිබෙනවා| | to chase and hunt|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අශ්ව"" (horse) as ""species"" and misses the context of tracking and hunting.
2. ""විශේෂ"" (specific) is translated as ""by these"" in the machine translation, but it should be ""by them"" to maintain the reference to the subject.
3. ""පවා"" (capable) is translated as ""they are capable of hunting"" in the machine translation, which is correct but could be more concise as ""to hunt"" in the reference.
4. ""හඹා"" (endangered) is missing in the machine translation, which is crucial for conveying the endangered status of the horse species.
5. ""ගොස්"" (chase) is not translated in the machine translation, while it is present in the reference.
6. ""දඩයම්"" (to chase) is not translated in the machine translation, which is an important part of the action.
7. ""මෙමගින්"" (with their ability) is not directly translated, but the reference translation implies the same idea with ""by this, with their ability.""
8. ""හැකියාව"" (received the opportunity) is translated as ""they have received the opportunity"" in the machine translation, which is accurate but could be simplified to ""enabled"" in the reference.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation, missing key details and the endangered status of the horse species, and the structure of the sentence is not as clear.

|Machine translation: Also in the year 2006, Deustche Bank circulated the wreckage of the wreckage of the wreckage and found parts of the bone.|
|Reference translation: Also , skeletal remains were found during the demolition of the Deustche Bank premises in 2006.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""සුන්බුන්"" (demolition) which is not accurately translated as ""wreckage of the wreckage"" in the machine translation. The reference translation uses ""demolition"" which is a more appropriate term for the context.
2. The machine translation incorrectly suggests that Deustche Bank circulated ""parts of the bone,"" which is not the intended meaning. The source text implies that skeletal remains were found, not that the bank distributed them.
3. The reference translation captures the correct meaning by stating ""skeletal remains were found"" and specifying the context as ""during the demolition.""

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the meaning and context, specifically regarding the action of finding skeletal remains and the description of the event. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

|Machine translation: Li and wu have been involved since the season where taishong lived.|
|Reference translation: There has been a relationship between Li and Wu since the time Taizhong lived.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""ටයිෂොං"" (Taishong), which is a proper noun, likely a person's name or a place. In the machine translation, it is translated as ""the season where taishong lived,"" which is incorrect. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""the time Taizhong lived,"" indicating a temporal context rather than a season.
2. The machine translation uses ""involved"" (which implies participation or engagement), while the reference translation uses ""relationship"" (which implies a connection or association). The source text does not specify the nature of the involvement, but the context suggests a relationship rather than a direct participation.
3. The machine translation uses ""since the season"" while the reference uses ""since the time."" The reference is more accurate in conveying the idea of a duration starting from a specific point in time.

Overall, the machine translation loses the intended meaning and context, particularly in its handling of the proper noun and the nature of the connection between Li and Wu. The reference translation better captures the essence of the source text.

|Machine translation: The damage to compensation for the parties that had broken the treaty.|
|Reference translation: Damage to be paid to the party who breached the agreement.|

Analysis:
1. The source text is about ""ගිවිසුම"" (compensation) and ""කඩවීම"" (violation) happening to a ""පාර්ශවයට"" (to the side) or ""වන්දි"" (party) that is ""සිදුවන"" (ongoing) or ""අලාභ"" (loss) or ""හානි"" (harm).
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""වන්දි"" as ""parties"" and ""අලාභ"" and ""හානි"" as ""compensation for the parties that had broken the treaty"", which is not accurate. It suggests a broader context of compensation for treaty breaches, whereas the source text is more specific to the party causing the violation.
3. The reference translation, on the other hand, correctly translates ""වන්දි"" as ""the party"" and ""අලාභ"" and ""හානි"" as ""damage to be paid"" and ""breached the agreement"", which is a more precise and faithful representation of the source text.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the party involved, the nature of the loss or harm, and the specific action (breach of agreement vs. treaty). The reference translation is a better quality translation that accurately captures the meaning of the source text.

|Machine translation: There is also a price decision in the market competition in the last 05 years.|
|Reference translation: Also, in the face of market competition, pricing has taken place over the past five years.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""වෙළඳපොල"" (market competition) and ""මිල තීරණය"" (pricing) as separate concepts, while the machine translation combines them into ""price decision in the market competition.""
2. The source uses ""අවසර"" (period) or ""වසර"" (time) to describe the duration, which is translated as ""last 05 years"" in the machine translation. The reference translation uses ""over the past five years,"" which is a more natural and accurate way to express the same idea in English.
3. The source text has ""පසුගිය"" (occurred or happened), which implies that pricing took place in the past, while the machine translation does not convey this past tense clearly.

|Thought: The machine translation seems to have a significant error in conveying the meaning of the source text.|
|Analysis:|
1. **Source:** ""2010දී"" - The source mentions a specific year, ""2010.""
2. **Machine translation:** ""In 2010"" - This part is correct, but the context is not clear.
3. **Source:** ""ටුටන්ඛාමුන්ගේ DNA පරීක්ෂාවත්"" - Refers to Tutankhamun's DNA test.
4. **Machine translation:** ""Tutankhamun's DNA test was ignored"" - This is close, but the word ""by"" is missing, and the phrase ""the opinion of marfan relief"" is not present.
5. **Source:** ""මාර්ෆන් සහලක්ෂණය"" - Refers to the morphine syndrome.
6. **Machine translation:** ""marfan relief"" - This is unrelated to the context, and the syndrome is not mentioned.
7. **Source:** ""පිළිබඳ"" - This word indicates that the morphine syndrome was ignored in relation to the DNA test.
8. **Machine translation:** ""was ignored by the opinion"" - Incorrect, as it does not convey the relationship to the DNA test.

**Conclusion:**
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. It incorrectly attributes the DNA test to the opinion of ""marfan relief"" instead of the context of the morphine syndrome. It also omits the relationship between the test and the syndrome, which is crucial for understanding the source text. The correct translation should be: ""With Tutankhamun's DNA test in 2010, the notion of morphine syndrome was ignored.""|im_end|

|Machine translation: Here the location of these can be seen as a keriatic saddle of the heart.|
|Reference translation: The location of these can be seen as a coronary artery on the surface of the heart.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""පිහිටුම"" (location) and ""පෘෂ්ඨයේ"" (heart's) ""කිරීටක ඛාතය"" (kiritic saddle), which is a term that might not have a direct translation in English. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""a keriatic saddle of the heart,"" which is not a standard term in English for describing a coronary artery. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the term ""coronary artery"" which is a more accurate and commonly understood term in English.

2. The source text also mentions that the location is ""ලෙසින්"" (in relation to) the heart's surface, but the machine translation does not explicitly convey this context. The reference translation includes this by stating ""on the surface of the heart.""

3. The structure of the sentence is slightly different in the machine translation, which might make it less clear or natural in English.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of the specific medical term used (kiritic saddle vs. coronary artery) and the context of the location on the heart's surface. The reference translation provides a more accurate and clear translation for the Sinhala text.

|Reference translation: 111 , Muslim , Jewish people generally experienced tolerance and solidarity under rule , 112 but its Almohad persecution-like violence, occasionally suppressed.|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation has a difference in the interpretation of ""පාලනය"" (rule) and ""under control,"" which is translated as ""under control"" in the MT, while the reference translation uses ""under rule"" to convey a similar meaning but with a more specific context of governance.
2. The machine translation mistranslates ""පීඩාව්වේ"" (persecution) as ""suffrage"" which is a completely different concept. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""persecution-like violence.""
3. The phrase ""මඩිනු ලැබූ"" (occasionally suppressed) is missing in the machine translation, which is an important part of the sentence to convey the sporadic nature of the suppression.

|Machine translation: Meanwhile, nematoda worms, drosophila fruit flies, dies, sheep and monkeys were included.|
|Reference translation: These included nematode worms, Drosophila fruit flies, mice, sheep, and monkeys.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text starts with ""මේ අතරට"" which means ""Meanwhile"" or ""Also included are"" in English. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Meanwhile"" without the context of ""also included"".
2. The source mentions ""Drosophila පළතුරු"" which refers to ""Drosophila fruit flies"" in Sinhala. The machine translation translates this as ""drosophila fruit flies"" without the word ""fruit"" which is a crucial part of the term.
3. The source includes ""මියන්"" which means ""mice"" in Sinhala. The machine translation omits this word, resulting in a missing item in the list.
4. The source also mentions ""බැටලුවන්"" which means ""sheep"" and ""වඳුරන්"" which means ""and monkeys"". The machine translation combines these into ""dies, sheep and monkeys"" without the correct word order or the use of ""and"" to connect them.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of:
- Missing the context of ""also included"" at the beginning.

2. The machine translation incorrectly states ""they had handed over to the two"" as ""අවිස්සාවේ"" (together), which is a misinterpretation of the context. The reference translation correctly understands that the two individuals are embarking on the task, not receiving ships from someone else.
3. The machine translation uses ""producing"" (producing), while the reference translation uses ""build"" (to build), which is a more accurate verb choice in this context, as it refers to the construction of ships.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the collaboration aspect (""අවිස්සාවේ"" or ""together""), the action of the task (producing vs. building), and the overall structure, which does not convey the unity and mission clearly as in the reference translation.

3. **""සම්පූර්ණයෙන්ම"" vs ""entirely""**: The machine translation uses ""fully painted,"" which is a less idiomatic way to express the same idea as ""entirely"" in the reference translation. The reference is clearer.
4. **""යුගයෙන්"" vs ""in his time""**: The machine translation uses ""his era,"" which is similar to ""in his time"" but less specific. The reference translation is more precise.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of the specific subject (tombs instead of cathedrals), the structure of the sentence, and the choice of words to convey the idea of the paintings being discovered and the substitution of tombs for colorful carvings. The reference translation is more accurate and contextually appropriate.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start| Step 1: Read the source text
Source: මේ සාධක හේතුවෙන් පිරිමි ළමයා තම ඊඩිපස් සංකීර්ණය අවරෝධනය කරයි.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: This factor causes the boy to perceive his eidepus complex.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: This factor causes the boy to perceive his eidepus complex.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The source text uses ""මේ සාධක"" (this factor) which is translated accurately as ""This factor"" in both the machine and reference translations.
- ""අමයා"" (causes) is translated correctly as ""causes"" in both.
- ""අවරෝධනය"" (restriction/aversion) is translated as ""perceive"" in the machine translation, which is a possible interpretation but not the exact equivalent of ""අවරෝධනය"" in this context. The reference translation uses ""perceive"" as well, but it's not clear if it's a direct translation or a suitable interpretation.
- ""අමයා"" (his) is not present in the machine translation, but it's implied by the context ""his eidepus complex"" and is not necessary for the meaning.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the choice of words for ""අවරෝධනය"" (restriction/aversion), which is translated as ""perceive"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation does not specify a verb for this action. The reference translation also omits the word ""අමයා"" (his) which is implied in the context. Overall, the meaning is preserved, but the phrasing and word choice differ slightly.

|Source:| තමන් කතිපයාධිකාරි වෙළඳපළ ආයතන නිසා| Machine translation: Due to their curriculum market institutions| Reference translation: Because they are oligarchy market institutions|
|Difference:| The source mentions ""වෙළඳපළ"" (literally, ""curriculum"" or ""syllabus"" in Sinhala) which refers to the educational aspect, while the machine translation omits this detail. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning by translating it as ""oligarchy market institutions"".|

|Source:| මිල තීරණය| Machine translation: price decision making| Reference translation: pricing|
|Difference:| The source uses ""මිල"" (literally, ""rice"" in Sinhala) as a metaphor for decision-making, likely referring to the pricing decisions in the context of the institutions. The machine translation translates it as ""price decision making"", which is a direct but less poetic translation. The reference translation simplifies it to ""pricing"", which is more accurate but loses the metaphorical aspect.|

|Source:| ලැුඳියාවකින්| Machine translation: with some mutual nuclear employment| Reference translation: by some mutual relation|
|Difference:| The source uses ""ලැුඳියාවකින්"" (literally, ""each other's hands"" in Sinhala), which implies a cooperative or interconnected relationship. The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""mutual nuclear employment"", which is unrelated to the context. The reference translation captures the meaning of interconnectedness or mutual relation more accurately.|

Overall, the machine translation has differences in terms of the educational context, the metaphorical use of ""මිල"", and the interpretation of the cooperative relationship. The reference translation is more faithful to the original meaning, although it loses some poetic elements in the process.

Analysis:
1. **Timeframe**: The machine translation uses ""While the aircraft are hijacked"" which suggests a continuous action, whereas the reference translation uses ""During the hijacking"" which indicates a specific period of time. The reference is more accurate in this context.

2. **Subject**: The source mentions ""මගින්"" (passengers) and ""ගුවන් සේවකයන්"" (airline employees), while the machine translation combines them into ""some passengers and airline employees."" The reference separates them as ""passengers and flight attendants,"" which is more specific.

3. **Devices**: The source mentions ""ගුවන්"" (airline) and ""පෞද්ගලික"" (personal) phones, while the machine translation combines them into ""air telephones and private telephones."" The reference separates them as ""airline and personal phones,"" which is clearer.

4. **Sentence structure**: The reference translation maintains a more natural and direct translation of the source text, while the machine translation has a slightly awkward structure.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of timeframe, subject specificity, and device separation. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the original Sinhala text.

|Machine translation: This is on the border between the southern karma lower karma and the southern karma cosica|
|Reference translation: This is located at the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle in the lower atrium of the right atrium|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""පහළ කර්ණිකකෝෂික"" (lower karma) and ""වම් කෝෂිකාව"" (cosica), which are likely medical terms or specific anatomical references. The machine translation incorrectly translates these as ""southern karma lower karma"" and ""southern karma cosica,"" which are not standard English terms and do not convey the intended meaning.

2. The reference translation correctly identifies the location as being ""at the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle"" within the ""lower atrium of the right atrium."" The machine translation does not provide this specific information, instead suggesting a vague border between two unspecified entities.

3. The structure of the sentence is also different in the machine translation, which does not maintain the same subject-verb-object order as the reference translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, specificity, and proper anatomical terminology. The reference translation provides a clear and precise location, while the machine translation fails to convey the intended meaning.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: This causes polar bears to be unable to survive the heat of their bodies and they can be killed.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: As a result, polar bears are unable to maintain their body temperature and may die.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation states ""the heat of their bodies"" while the reference translation says ""to maintain their body temperature."" The source text does not specify whether it's the heat or the ability to regulate temperature, but the reference seems more accurate in this context.
- The machine translation uses ""and they can be killed"" which implies a certainty, while the reference translation uses ""may die,"" which is less definitive and more in line with the uncertainty of the situation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the source text, specifically in the description of the effect on polar bears. The machine translation seems to overstate the certainty of death due to heat, while the reference translation is more cautious and consistent with the potential consequences mentioned in the source.

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""අවස්ථාවේ"" (at the beginning) or ""අරම්භයේ"" (in the context of starting), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it implies a starting point, but the reference translation uses ""just to make money"" to convey the purpose of starting the insurance companies.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අවස්ථාවේ"" as ""money only,"" which is not accurate. The reference translation captures the idea that the companies started insurance companies for the sole purpose of making money.
3. The subject ""අවස්ථාවේ"" (individuals) is translated as ""Some individuals"" in the machine translation, which is correct, but the reference translation uses ""Some people"" which might be a more common way to refer to individuals in English.

Machine translation: ""Is there bhakti poetry in the romantic language, which is not as original as Sanskrit poetry.""

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The source text uses ""ප්රයකෘත"" (vernacular) instead of ""romantic language"" in the machine translation.
- The source text uses ""ලද"" (written) to describe the bhakti poetry, while the machine translation omits this.
- The source text uses ""මුල් තැනක්"" (not prominent) to describe the comparison with Sanskrit poetry, while the machine translation uses ""not as original.""

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: ""Although there are devotional poems written in the vernacular, it is not as prominent as the Sanskrit devotional poems.""

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The reference translation captures the idea of devotional poems in the vernacular and the comparison with Sanskrit devotional poems more accurately.
- The reference translation uses ""although"" to introduce the contrast, which is not present in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific language type (vernacular vs. romantic) and the choice of words to convey the comparison (not prominent vs. not as original).

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""ලියාඕ සෙන්පතියකු"" (Liao general), which is not accurately translated as ""A Liao Ceng"" in the machine translation. The machine translation seems to interpret ""Liao"" as a name or title, but it should be translated as ""Liao general"" to match the reference.
2. The verb ""පවසා"" (claimed) is present in both the source and machine translation, but it's not explicitly stated who is making the claim in the machine translation. The reference adds ""said"" to clarify the action, which is important for understanding the context.
3. The phrase ""800,000කින්"" (800,000) is correctly translated in both, but the word order is slightly different in the machine translation, which might make it sound less natural.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: But there are also illustrations of another god not standing on a mountain while Inanna was standing.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation seems to have mistranslated ""කන්දක්"" (ladder) as ""mountain"" and ""සිටිය"" (was standing) as ""would stand"" and ""not stand"" in a confusing manner.
- It also incorrectly translates ""නොසිටිනු"" (while not) as ""modified exceptions"" which does not make sense in this context.
- The reference translation correctly mentions ""Illustrations"" and ""Inanna"" which are not present in the machine translation.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation incorrectly translates the location of the ladder (mountain vs. standing) and the relationship between the ladder and the other god.
- The machine translation misses the context of Inanna, which is a key figure in the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, context, and proper interpretation of the source text. It would be important to improve the translation to convey the intended meaning of the Sinhala text.

|Reference translation: But since no one else came forward, in late 1755 he accepted the appointment of commander of the Virginia Militia.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""අවසන් භාගයේ"" (final year), which is translated as ""the final year of 1755"" in both the machine and reference translations. This part is consistent.
2. The machine translation adds ""the Virginia Militia Army,"" which is not present in the source text. The reference translation, on the other hand, says ""the appointment of commander of the Virginia Militia,"" which is a more accurate representation of the source's ""අණදෙන"" (accepted) and ""වර්ජීනියා මිලීෂියා"" (Virginia Militia).
3. The machine translation uses ""presented heyne,"" which is not a suitable verb for the context, as it implies someone giving a presentation, while the source is about accepting a position. The reference translation uses ""came forward,"" which is a more accurate expression of someone offering themselves for a role.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the addition of ""the Virginia Militia Army"" and the incorrect verb ""presented heyne.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""So the fragmented elegy can be considered a poetic passage, a synthesis composed of fragments.""
- Reference translation: ""Therefore , the beauty of the Buddha can be considered as a work that combines poetry and Buddhism.""

Differences:
1. ""fragmented elegy"" vs ""beauty of the Buddha"": The machine translation refers to a ""fragmented elegy,"" while the reference translation specifically mentions the ""beauty of the Buddha.""
2. ""poetic passage"" vs ""poetry and Buddhism"": The machine translation describes the work as a ""poetic passage"" and a ""synthesis of fragments,"" while the reference translation combines poetry and Buddhism directly, without the concept of a passage or fragments.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation
The machine translation loses the specific context of the Buddha's beauty and the religious aspect, which is crucial in the original text. It also changes the meaning by referring to a ""fragmented elegy"" instead of the ""beauty of the Buddha"" as a synthesis.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation, as it fails to capture the essence of the original text, which is the connection between the beauty of the Buddha and the combination of poetry and Buddhism.

Analysis:
1. The source text is in Sinhala, a language spoken in Sri Lanka, and refers to ""වෛරස්"" (viruses) that affect ""අසාදනය"" (plants) and ""්‍රැගෙන"" (carriers).
2. The machine translation correctly identifies ""species"" as ""species"" (ශාක) and ""considered carriers"" as ""are considered carriers"".
3. However, the machine translation incorrectly translates ""අසාදනය"" (plants) as ""carry plants"" instead of ""viruses that infect plants"". The reference translation correctly phrases it as ""viruses that infect plants"".
4. The word ""වෛරස්"" is not directly translated to ""viruses"" in the machine translation, but the meaning is still conveyed.

In conclusion, the main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the specific phrasing related to the viruses affecting plants.

|Reference translation: The dinosaur is the name Dale Russell gave to the model animal he created.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""නාමය්කියාවේ"" (namaykiyave), which means ""he named it"" or ""it was named by him."" The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the name given to the stratigraphic animal"" and ""a dinosaurid,"" suggesting that Dale Russell created a dinosaurid, which is not explicitly stated in the source.
2. The source refers to ""අකෘතිමය"" (akritimaya), which is a stratigraphic layer or formation, not an animal. The machine translation conflates this with ""stratigraphic animal,"" which is not accurate.
3. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning that Dale Russell named the model animal, not the animal itself.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the stratigraphic context and the specific type of animal.

|Source: Ursus arctos විශේෂයෙන් පැවතෙන Ursus maritimus tyrannus නම් උපවිශේෂය Pleistocene යුගයේදී වදවීගේ|
|Machine translation: Ursus arctos specifically descended from ursus maritimus tyrannus who was subsequently worried during the Pleistocene era.|
|Reference translation: Ursus maritimus tyrannus , a subspecies of Ursus arctos , became extinct during the Pleistocene era.|

Analysis:

1. **Source meaning**: The source text states that Ursus maritimus tyrannus is a specific type or subspecies of Ursus arctos, and it refers to an event where it became extinct during the Pleistocene epoch.

2. **Machine translation difference**: The machine translation incorrectly suggests that Ursus maritimus tyrannus was worried during the Pleistocene era, which is not supported by the source text. The source only mentions its extinction, not its emotional state.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source, stating that Ursus maritimus tyrannus is a subspecies of Ursus arctos and its extinction during the Pleistocene.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation by incorrectly interpreting the event as worry instead of extinction. The reference translation provides a more accurate and faithful representation of the source text.

Step 1: Identify the source text
Source: මේ සිදුවීමෙන් පසුව කිසිදු නිලධාරියකු අධිරජුව විවේචනය කිරීමට නොපෙළඹුණු බව පැවසේ.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
Machine translation: None of the officials after this event were said to have criticized the empire.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation
Reference translation: It is said that no official was tempted to criticize the emperor after this incident.

Step 4: Analyze differences
1. The machine translation omits the word ""අධිරජුව"" (criticized) and replaces it with ""criticized the empire"" which is a more direct translation but loses the nuance of the original text, which implies that officials were not tempted or disinclined to criticize.
2. The machine translation uses ""were said to have"" which suggests a past action, while the reference translation uses ""was tempted to"" which implies a potential action, suggesting a difference in emphasis.
3. The reference translation includes the word ""the emperor"" which is not present in the source text but is likely inferred from context.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the implied intention of officials not criticizing, the use of ""tempted"" instead of ""criticized,"" and the inclusion of ""the emperor"" without explicit reference in the source text. The machine translation loses some of the nuance and context present in the reference translation.

|Machine translation:| After the war, Germany's acquisition of the Soviet Union wars against Germany when the Soviet Union came to an effect.|
|Reference translation:| They agreed on the acquisition of post-war Germany and when the Soviet Union would go to war against Germany.|

|im_end|>

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""Germany's acquisition of the Soviet Union"" in the context of a war, not ""the Soviet Union wars against Germany."" The machine translation incorrectly reverses the relationship, stating that the Soviet Union was at war with Germany.
2. The phrase ""වරෙහිව"" in the source text is translated as ""came to an effect"" in the machine translation, which does not convey the intended meaning of the agreement or decision-making process. The reference translation uses ""when the Soviet Union would go to war,"" which is a more accurate representation of the timing.
3. The machine translation omits the word ""අත්කරණයෙන්"" (acquisition) from the source, which is crucial for understanding the context.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, the timing of the war, and the missing reference to the acquisition. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the original Sinhala text.

|Machine translation: One in Yorkshire and one in selioux in Birmingham.|
|Reference translation: One in Yorkshire and one in Celiork, Birmingham.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""සෙලිඕර්ක්"" which is a Sinhala word that likely refers to a specific place or location. In the machine translation, it is translated as ""selioux,"" which is not a recognizable place name in either Sinhala or English. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""Celiork,"" which seems to be a misspelling or a possible error in the reference, but it is likely intended to represent the same location as in the source.
2. The punctuation in the source text is a ""දී"" (dī), which is a Sinhala conjunction meaning ""and."" The machine translation omits this conjunction, resulting in a slightly awkward sentence structure. The reference translation includes the conjunction, but it is written as ""Birmingham,"" which is not correct in this context.

Conclusion:
The machine translation has differences in the handling of the location name ""සෙලිඕර්ක්"" and the punctuation. The translation of the location name is incorrect, and the reference translation might have a typo or a different interpretation of the location. The punctuation is missing in the machine translation, which affects the sentence structure. The overall quality of the machine translation is lower due to these inaccuracies.

|Machine translation:| The Original Archaic teeth of the upper jaw, including the subcutaneous charcoal teeth, have two original teeth.|
|Reference translation:| Two premolars in the upper jaw and molars in the lower jaw have two tooth roots.|

Analysis:
1. **Original Archaic teeth vs Two premolars**: The machine translation refers to ""Original Archaic teeth"" which is not accurate in this context. The reference translation specifies ""premolars"" in the upper jaw, which is a more precise term for the type of tooth mentioned.
2. **Subcutaneous charcoal teeth**: The machine translation includes this phrase, which is not present in the source text. The source only mentions ""upper jaw"" and ""lower jaw"" without specifying any type of unusual teeth.
3. **Tooth roots vs two original teeth**: The machine translation states that the teeth have ""two original teeth,"" which is a misinterpretation. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""two tooth roots,"" indicating the anatomical structure.

In summary, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of specificity (premolars vs Original Archaic teeth), accuracy (omitting the subcutaneous charcoal teeth), and the meaning of the phrase (two tooth roots vs two original teeth).

|Reference translation:| In later cases, the bacteria can invade the internal organs, in which case only antibiotics can be effective.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""අවයව"" (attack), which is not accurately translated as ""can invade"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly uses ""invade"" to describe the action of bacteria.
2. The machine translation incorrectly adds ""including case internal organs"" after ""antibiotics,"" which is not present in the source text. The reference translation omits this phrase, making it clearer that the context is about the bacteria's ability to invade internal organs, not antibiotics themselves.
3. The structure of the sentence is slightly different in the machine translation, which affects the flow and clarity. The reference translation maintains a more natural structure, connecting ""in which case"" to the idea of bacteria invading internal organs.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: From then on, canneries across the United States began to dig well into the oil.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: From then on, miners all over America began to dig wells in search of oil.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""අිං හෑරීමට"" (to search for) which is not accurately translated as ""dig well into"" in the machine translation. The machine translation suggests that canneries were digging deep into the oil, which is not the same as searching for it.
- The source text uses ""පුරා"" (all over) which is not directly translated in the machine translation. It implies the entire country, while the machine translation uses ""across the United States,"" which is a more specific geographical term.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly translates ""අිං හෑරීමට"" as ""in search of"" and uses ""miners"" instead of ""canneries,"" which is a more appropriate term for the context of searching for oil.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the action (mining vs. canning) and the phrase ""in search of"" which conveys the purpose of digging wells. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly in line with each other, with only a minor difference in punctuation. The source text uses a full stop (.) at the end of the sentence, while the machine and reference translations both use an apostrophe followed by a period ('.') to indicate the end of the sentence. This is a common style in English when using contracted forms like ""Let's"" instead of the full ""Let us."" The meaning conveyed by both translations is the same: they suggest considering the use of RAM without additional details.

The main difference in quality lies in the punctuation, which might be slightly less formal in the machine translation but still comprehensible. If the goal is to adhere strictly to formal English, the reference translation would be more appropriate. However, for casual or everyday conversation, the machine translation is acceptable. Overall, the translation is accurate, but the refinement in punctuation is where the machine translation could be improved.

|Machine translation: The body of animals has multiple wools to adapt to harsh winter|
|Reference translation: The body of animals have abundant amounts of fur to adapt to harsh winter|
|Analysis:|
1. The source text refers to ""ාතුන්ගේ"" (sathunge), which is a Sinhala term for ""body"" or ""animal's body"" in this context. The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""animals"" without specifying the body.
2. The source uses ""ුල්"" (ulum), which means ""wool"" or ""fur"" in Sinhala. The machine translation translates it as ""wools,"" which is not accurate as it implies multiple types, while the reference translation uses ""fur,"" which is a more appropriate term for the context.
3. The phrase ""අනුවර්තනය වීමට"" (anuvarthanaya vīmata) means ""to adapt to"" in Sinhala. The machine translation correctly captures this, but the reference translation omits it, making the sentence slightly less clear.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity (referring to the animal's body and using ""fur"" instead of ""wools"") and clarity (omitting the adaptation part). The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

- ""නබි"" (Prophet)
- ""අතුරුණු"" (noble)
- ""අග්ගිරිම"" (mention)
- ""අමතකාන්නාහ"" (to do this)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""So add with the name of the nobility and mention this.""
- Reference translation: ""Therefore, they add this to the name of the Prophet and mention it.""

Differences:
1. ""අතුරුණු"" (noble) is not translated in the machine translation, while it is ""Prophet"" in the reference translation.
2. The word order is slightly different: ""අතුරුණු"" is placed before ""අග්ගිරිම"" in the source, but ""Prophet"" is placed after ""add"" in the reference translation.
3. The reference translation uses ""they"" (implied by ""they add""), which is not present in the machine translation.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality
The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it omits the reference to the ""Prophet"" and changes the structure of the sentence. The reference translation captures the meaning more precisely, including the connection to a specific person (Prophet) and the action of adding and mentioning something.

Conclusion: The machine translation could be improved by including the reference to the ""Prophet"" and maintaining a similar sentence structure to the reference translation for better clarity and accuracy.

Reference translation: I asked him if he had many sons with the same name.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""He has a lot of sons with one name and was heard by me,"" which implies that the person was not only having many sons with the same name but also that the speaker heard about it.
- The reference translation, on the other hand, says ""I asked him if he had many sons with the same name,"" which focuses on the act of asking a question, not the result of the question being heard.

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""නිරතුරු"" (natural disasters) in Sinhala, which is not accurately translated as ""absolute naturalization"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of natural disasters.
2. The phrase ""විපත්"" (rebellion) in the source is translated as ""gambian rebellion"" in the machine translation, which adds a specific reference to a location (Gambia) that is not present in the original text. The reference translation simply uses ""rebellion"" without specifying a location.
3. The phrase ""ගැමි"" (caused by) is translated as ""caused by"" in both the machine and reference translations, but the context is different. The machine translation implies a cause-effect relationship between the rebellion and naturalization, while the reference translation connects the rebellion to the natural disasters.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""natural disasters"" as ""absolute naturalization"" and the addition of a specific location (Gambia) for the rebellion, which are not present in the original source text.

|Source: 1418 අගෝස්තුවේදී තේජොංගේ සිහසුන අත්හැරීමට මාස දෙකකට පෙර |
|Machine translation: In August 1418, two months before the abdication of tejong's throne, |
|Reference translation: In August 1418 , two months before leaving Tejong 's throne , |

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of the term ""ascended the throne"" in the reference, which is not present in the machine translation. The machine translation uses ""came to the throne"" instead, which is a less precise term for the event of Sejong taking the throne after Tejong's abdication. The reference translation also adds the possessive apostrophe to ""Tejong's throne"" to indicate ownership, which is not in the machine translation.

Additionally, the reference translation uses ""Sejong the Great"" to provide context, which is not included in the machine translation. This is a significant difference as it is a proper noun and adds clarity about the specific person being referred to.

In summary, the machine translation is missing the term ""ascended the throne"" and the honorific ""the Great"" for Sejong, and it omits the possessive apostrophe for Tejong's throne. These differences affect the clarity and accuracy of the translation.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: ""එක අනුව විශ්වයේ ඇති සියලුම දෑ අප දන්නා භෞතික පදාර්ථයෙන් නිර්මිත බව ඔහුගේ අදහස විය.""
Machine translation: ""According to his idea that all the arms in the universe are immune from the physical matter we know.""

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The source text uses ""එක"" (ek) which means ""one"" or ""accordingly"" in this context, while the machine translation omits it.
- The source text uses ""අනුව"" (anuv) which means ""idea"" or ""view"" in this context, but the machine translation translates it as ""that"".
- The source text uses ""අදහස"" (adahas) which means ""believed"" or ""thinking"", but the machine translation uses ""immune from"" which is not an accurate translation of the concept.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: ""Accordingly, he believed that everything in the universe was made of the physical matter we know.""

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation captures the meaning of ""එක"" as ""accordingly"" and maintains the context.
- The reference translation uses ""believed"" (which is ""he believed"" in the source) instead of ""immune from"", which is more accurate.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""අනුව"" as ""that"" and ""අදහස"" as ""believed"".

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the omission of ""එක"" and the inaccurate translation of ""අදහස"" as ""immune from"". The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source text, especially in conveying the idea of belief and the connection to physical matter.

|Machine translation: Some of the employees within these buildings have travelled up the impact to survive by air support.|
|Reference translation: Some of those working in these buildings have gone upstairs to escape by air aid after the collision.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""මෙම ගොඩනැගිලි"" (these buildings) and ""සේවයේ"" (service or working), which implies employees are involved in some service or work.
2. ""නිරත"" (unprotected) suggests that the employees are not initially in a safe position.
3. ""�ට්ටනයෙන්"" (collision) is not directly translated in the machine translation, which might be a key term indicating an event.
4. ""අනතුරුව"" (unexpectedly) implies the action was sudden or unplanned.
5. ""�හළට"" (upstairs) is translated as ""up the impact"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate. It should be translated as ""to escape"" or ""to go upstairs.""
6. ""ගමන්"" (to manage or handle) is translated as ""survive by air support"" in the machine translation, which is a misinterpretation. It should be translated as ""to escape"" or ""to flee.""

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in several aspects:
- It does not capture the term ""�ට්ටනයෙන්"" (collision) and its implications.
- It incorrectly translates ""අනතුරුව"" (unexpectedly) as ""to survive by air support.""
- It incorrectly translates ""�හළට"" (upstairs) as ""up the impact.""
- The overall meaning of the sentence is not accurately conveyed, with the focus on survival through air support being misplaced. The reference translation correctly conveys the idea of employees escaping after a collision by going upstairs with air aid.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Then it passes through the body by the blood of the sugar formation.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: It then travels throughout the body in the form of sugar through the blood of animals.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The source text refers to ""සීනි"" (sugar) and ""සතුන්ගේ"" (animal's), which are not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it mentions ""blood of the sugar formation,"" which is not a standard phrase in the context.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""throughout the body"" as ""අලුත්වයෙන්"" (in the form) and ""through the blood of animals"" as ""අනිමාලාගේ පුවත්"".
- The machine translation omits the word ""අනිමාලා"" (animals) and uses a less accurate term for the sugar.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the specific reference to sugar and the animal's blood. The reference translation captures the meaning more accurately, while the machine translation loses some context and uses a less precise term.

Machine translation: The notes of the lateral varieties are mentioned only on a queen.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Records of later years refer only to a queen.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text talks about ""පසුකාලීණ වර්ෂවල"" (later years) and ""සටහන්වල"" (varieties) being mentioned, with a focus on ""රැජිනක"" (queen).
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""ලateral varieties"" as ""the notes"" and specifies that they are mentioned ""on a queen,"" which is not the intended meaning.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text by using ""Records"" instead of ""notes"" and maintaining the focus on ""later years"" and ""a queen.""

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
1. It incorrectly translates ""ලateral varieties"" as ""the notes.""
2. It specifies that the notes are mentioned ""on a queen,"" which is not the intended meaning of the source text, which refers to records referring to a queen in later years.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: මෙය ආශ්වාසය හෝ වෙනස් කපාට හෝ හෘත් ගැටලු නිසා ඇතිවිය
Machine translation: This can be due to inhalation or different cutaneous or heart problems.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- In the source text, ""වෙනස්"" (cutaneous) is translated as ""cutaneous"" in the machine translation, which is correct.
- However, ""හෘත්"" (heart) is translated as ""heart problems"" in the machine translation, which is a broader term than the source, which specifically mentions ""ගැටලු"" (problems).

Step 3: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
Reference translation: This can be caused by breathing or different valves or heart problems.

Step 4: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation omits the word ""ගැටලු"" (problems) from the source, which is translated as ""valves"" in the reference translation.
- The reference translation uses ""caused by"" instead of ""due to,"" but this is a minor difference in phrasing.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the specific mention of ""heart problems"" as ""valves or heart problems,"" which is a more precise translation of the source text. Additionally, the reference translation uses ""caused by"" instead of ""due to,"" but both convey a similar meaning.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation omits the word ""queen"" in the reference, which is important to convey the gender of the suggested parent.
- The machine translation uses ""unidentified descent"" instead of ""an unidentified queen,"" which changes the meaning slightly, as ""descent"" does not specify gender.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not include the gender-specific term ""queen"" and uses a more general term ""unidentified descent"" instead, which may alter the intended meaning.

|Machine translation:| In Muslim culture, Muhammad is considered the last prophet who knew everything.
|Reference translation:| In Muslim culture, Muhammad is considered to be the last knower of all things.

Analysis:
1. The source text uses the term ""අවසාන ශාස්තෘවරයා"" (last savior), which refers to the Prophet Muhammad's role as the final guide or helper in Islam. The machine translation, however, translates this as ""the last prophet who knew everything,"" which is a different interpretation, focusing on the aspect of knowledge rather than the savior aspect.

2. The reference translation omits the word ""අවසාන"" (last) from the source, but it is implied in the context of ""the last knower."" The machine translation includes ""last"" explicitly, which is accurate.

3. The reference translation uses ""to be"" (considered to be) to express the belief, which is a more natural phrasing in English than the machine translation's ""is considered the.""

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the Prophet Muhammad's role, focusing on knowledge instead of the savior aspect. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Sinhala text in terms of conveying the cultural understanding of Muhammad's position.

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""බදු"" (taxes) being ""ැදෙන"" (incurred) in the context of ""වෙළඳාමේ"" (trade) in Europe. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""බදු"" as ""da taxes"" and ""ැදෙන"" as ""grew more effective"", which does not convey the correct meaning of taxation in this context.
2. The machine translation incorrectly uses ""sales"" instead of a more appropriate term like ""yield"" or ""practicality"" to describe the effect of taxes on trade. The reference translation uses ""higher yields"" to indicate the outcome.
3. The machine translation omits the phrase ""within the country"" from the source, which is crucial to understanding the context of the tax's impact.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""Iවන"" and ""IIවන"" which are Sinhala numerals for ""I"" and ""II"" respectively, referring to two different Parantaka rulers. The machine translation omits this context, translating it as ""The Temples"" without specifying the rulers.

|Analysis|
1. **""මහා නියඟයකින්""** (the great order) - Machine translation: ""the great order of the same year"" - Reference translation: ""a severe drought"". The machine translation incorrectly identifies the cause as a great order, while the reference refers to a drought.
2. **""අධිරාජිනිය""** (empress) - Machine translation: ""emperor"" - The machine translation incorrectly translates the gender, as the empress is a female figure.
3. **""අධිරාජිනිය ධුරයෙන්""** (by the empress's misfortune) - Machine translation: ""the emperor should be expelled from the court"" - The machine translation does not convey the idea of misfortune or the proposal to depose the empress, instead suggesting an expulsion from the court.
4. **""නෙරපිය""** (hit) - Machine translation: ""suffered"" - Both translations convey the idea of a negative event affecting the country, but ""hit"" (nirapiy) is a more direct and idiomatic translation.

|Analysis|
1. **Difference in structure**: The machine translation maintains the same structure as the source, while the reference translation rephrases it to emphasize the winners and the medals. The machine translation reads as a list of actions (first, second, and third placed contestants), whereas the reference presents it as a description of the winners and the medal awards.

2. **Omission of ""winners""**: The machine translation does not include the word ""winners"" which is crucial to convey the intended meaning. It implies that the contestants are receiving the medals based on their positions, but the reference makes it clear that only the winners receive the medals.

3. **Reordering of ""gold, silver, bronze""**: The machine translation places ""gold, silver, and bronze"" after ""second and third placed contestants,"" while the reference places it after ""first, second, and third place."" This difference in phrasing does not change the meaning, but the reference is more concise and clear.

4. **""In order to receive"" vs. ""will be awarded""**: The machine translation uses ""in order to receive,"" which is less formal than ""will be awarded"" in the reference. The reference directly states the outcome, making it more suitable for a formal context.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Identify key phrases and words in the source text
- ""කෙසේනමුත්"" (However)
- ""නග්න දේවතාවිය"" (naked goddess)
- ""එල්ලා"" (drooping)
- ""වැටෙන"" (hanging)
- ""පියාපත්"" (wings)
- ""මගින්"" (as in ""with"")
- ""ලෝගුවක්"" (a cloak)
- ""නිරූපණය"" (representation)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""climbing angel"" is not present in the source, it's a misinterpretation. The correct term is ""නග්න දේවතාවිය"" (naked goddess).
- ""hanging wings"" is translated as ""climbing angel's hanging wings"" in the machine, but it should be ""වැටෙන"" (drooping) in reference to the goddess.
- ""map a cloak"" is not a suitable translation for ""නිරූපණය"" (representation) in this context.

Step 3: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation introduces a new element (climbing angel) that is not in the source text, which changes the meaning.
- It incorrectly translates the ""වැටෙන"" (drooping) wings as ""hanging"" and associates them with a climbing angel, while the reference keeps it as a description of the goddess.
- The machine translation uses ""map a cloak"" which is a metaphor that does not accurately convey the idea of ""representation"" in the source.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, context, and the interpretation of key phrases. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text by focusing on the ""drooping wings"" of the ""naked goddess"" and its representation as a ""cloak.""

|Source:| එයට හේතුව ඇය සිය රූකඩ පාලකයා ආරක්ෂා කරගැනීමට හෝ ඇතැම්විට අක්නාටන් සමග ගෙනගිය ආකාරයේ හවුල් පාලනයක් ගෙන ගිය හෙයින් විය හැකියි.|
|Machine translation:| It is possible that she may have defended her puppet ruler or sometimes the heyday of the shared control carried out with akhnatan.|
|Reference translation:| This may have been because she defended her puppet ruler or perhaps carried out a joint rule of sorts with Aknatan.|

Analysis:
1. **Pronoun translation**: The source uses ""ඇයට"" (for her) which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation uses ""This may have been because she"", which is a more accurate representation.
2. **Action description**: The source mentions ""අරක්ෂා කරගැනීමට"" (defending) and ""ගෙනගිය"" (carried out), which are translated as ""defended"" and ""carried out"" respectively in the reference translation. The machine translation omits the context of ""defending"" and uses ""the heyday of the shared control"", which is not as clear as the reference.
3. **Joint rule**: The source uses ""ගෙනගිය"" (with) and ""අක්නාටන්"" (Aknatan) to imply a joint action. The machine translation mentions ""shared control carried out with akhnatan"", which is a less precise term for a joint rule. The reference translation, ""carried out a joint rule of sorts with Aknatan"", is more accurate.

Overall, the machine translation loses some clarity and nuance in describing the actions and the nature of the joint rule, while the reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text.

Step 1: Identify the main components of the source text
- ""පසුව"" (Later)
- ""යකඩයෙන්"" (in a cylinder)
- ""෭න්"" (of iron)
- ""්ට්"" (to)
- ""ුලා"" (this peel)
- ""ලද"" (is placed)
- ""්ට්"" (into)
- ""සිලින්ඩරයක්"" (an iron cylinder)
- ""ක්"" (the)
- ""බාහා"" (baha steamer)
- ""ෙන්"" (from)
- ""්ට්"" (the boiler)
- ""අවිස්සා"" (improperly)
- ""වාෂ්පයෙන්"" (by steaming)
- ""්ට්"" (into)
- ""්ට්"" (and)
- ""පදම්"" (tempering)
- ""කරනු"" (to be done)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""Later in a cylinder of iron, this peel is based on the boiler from the baha steamer proper.""
- Reference translation: ""The barrel is then steamed into an iron cylinder and properly tempered.""

Differences:
1. ""යකඩයෙන්"" (in a cylinder) is translated as ""Later in a cylinder of iron"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation refers to the barrel being steamed into the cylinder, which is more accurate.
2. ""ලද"" (is placed) is not present in the machine translation, which might imply that the peel is being inserted or introduced, but the reference translation uses ""steamed"" which is more suitable for the context.
3. ""අවිස්සා"" (improperly) is missing in the machine translation, which suggests that the process is not described as being done incorrectly. The reference translation uses ""properly tempered"" which indicates a correct tempering process.
4. ""වාෂ්පයෙන්"" (by steaming) is translated as ""based on"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly uses ""steamed"" to describe the action.

Conclusion: The machine translation has differences in the context, accuracy, and structure compared to the reference translation. It is not as clear or precise in conveying the intended meaning of the source text.

|im_start|>|im_sep| Analyzing the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. **Source text**: The source text in Sinhala states, ""විදේශ වල ජනාවාස ඇති කිරීමේ ප්රධාන කලාප කිහිපයක් යුරෝපයේ තිබුනේය.""
2. **Machine translation**: ""Several major zones of colonization in foreign countries were in Europe.""
3. **Reference translation**: ""Several major zones of colonization in foreign countries were in Europe.""

The differences are:
- The machine translation omits the word ""කිරීමේ"" (of colonization) from the source text. This is a crucial part that specifies the context of the zones being discussed.
- The machine translation does not include the word ""කිහිපයක්"" (specifically) in the translation, which might be implied in the reference translation but is not directly translated.

Overall, the machine translation is missing some context and precision compared to the reference translation. The main difference lies in the lack of the specific term ""කිරීමේ"" and the implied ""කිහිපයක්,"" which are important for a clear understanding of the source text.|im_end|>

|Machine translation: All of them received their gold medals and certificates after world War II|
|Reference translation: All of them received their gold medals and certificates after World War II|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""සියලු"" (siyalu), which is a colloquial term for ""world"" in Sinhala. The machine translation omits this term, using ""world War II"" without specifying it as a colloquial or formal term.
2. The reference translation capitalizes ""World War II,"" which is standard in English to refer to a specific historical event. The machine translation does not capitalize it, making it less clear and formal.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in two aspects:
1. It does not include the colloquial term ""සියලු"" in the translation, which might affect the readability or cultural accuracy for a Sinhala speaker.
2. It does not capitalize ""world War II,"" which reduces the clarity and formal tone of the sentence, as per standard English usage.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should consider including the colloquial term and capitalizing ""World War II"" to match the reference translation.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: එවැනි වෙලාවක් දී වෙනත් තැනකට ගසන ගල් පවා ආයුෂ්මත් අංගුලිමාලයන් වහන්සේ ගේ ඇඟට යි වදින්නේ.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Even rocks that flourish elsewhere at such time are hit by the body of livestock.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: At such a time, even the stones thrown elsewhere hit the body of the living Angulimala.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අංගුලිමාලයන්"" (Angulimalas) as ""livestock"" (which is ""වහන්සේ"" in Sinhala), while the reference translation correctly identifies them as ""stones"" (which is ""stones"" in English, implied by ""stones thrown elsewhere"").
- The machine translation also omits the word ""Angulimala"" entirely, which is a proper noun referring to a specific concept in the source text.
- The phrase ""are hit by the body"" in the machine translation is translated as ""are hit by the body of"" which adds unnecessary detail and is not present in the reference translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the identification of the objects being hit (stones vs. livestock) and the proper noun ""Angulimala."" The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original meaning of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: මෙම පොතද ජාකොමේ ගොන්සාල්වෙස් පියතුමාගේ අද්විතීය රචනාවකි.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: This book is also the unique essay of Father Jacomé Gonzalves.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: This book is also an excellent compilation by Father Jacome Gonzalvez.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""unique essay"" while the reference translation uses ""excellent compilation."" The word choice is different, with ""unique"" implying a singular, one-of-a-kind work, and ""excellent compilation"" suggesting a collection of diverse or high-quality pieces.
- The reference translation has ""Father Jacome"" with a single 'o' in ""Gonzalvez,"" while the machine translation has ""Father Jacomé"" with an 'é' in the middle. This is a difference in spelling, which might be a typographical error or a difference in the source text.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the description of the book (unique essay vs. excellent compilation) and the spelling of the author's name. The reference translation provides a more positive and nuanced description, while the machine translation might be literal and less accurate in capturing the intended meaning.

|Analysis|
1. **Subject identification**: The source mentions ""අබු හමීඩ් අල් ගසාලි"" as a ""විසු දේවධර්මධරයෙකු"" (a theologian), while the machine translation incorrectly identifies him as a ""judge"". The reference translation correctly identifies him as a theologian.
2. **Temporal reference**: Both the source and reference translation use ""11 වැනි"" (11th-century) to describe the time frame, but the machine translation omits this detail, making it unclear when the arguments were presented.
3. **Action description**: The source states that Abu Hamid Al Ghazali ""අවසානයේදී"" (eventually) won, while the machine translation implies that he ""finally won"", which is a similar meaning but not an exact translation of the source.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in identifying Abu Hamid Al Ghazali as a theologian instead of a judge, and in providing a more precise temporal reference by including ""11th-century"".

|Reference translation: The pulmonary aorta divides to form the left and right pulmonary arteries|
|Analysis:|
1. The source text is in Sinhala, discussing a ""pupils"" in a medical context, which refers to the pulmonary artery in this case, not the eyes' pupils.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""පුප්ඵුසීය"" (pupils) as ""left and right pupils,"" which is a literal translation that does not make sense in the context of a medical term.
3. The reference translation correctly translates ""පුප්ඵුසීය මහාපථය"" (pulmonary aorta) and ""දකුණු"" (divides) to convey the anatomical division of the aorta into the pulmonary arteries.
4. The machine translation omits the crucial information about the division process, which is present in the reference translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation is of poor quality due to its incorrect interpretation of the medical term and the lack of context-specific information about the division process. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

|Machine translation:| But because a peace treaty was not signed, both countries were officially in war.
|Reference translation:| But since no peace agreement was signed, both countries were officially at war.

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""නමුත්"" which means ""But"" in English, and the machine translation captures this correctly.
2. The phrase ""සාම ගිවිසුමක්"" refers to ""a peace treaty"" and the machine translation translates it as ""a peace treaty"", which is accurate.
3. The difference lies in the use of ""අත්සන්"" (not) and ""නොකෙරුණු"" (was not signed) in the source text, which convey the negation of the signing of the treaty. The machine translation combines these into ""was not signed"" as ""was not signed"", which is a correct interpretation.
4. The phrase ""රටවල්"" (officially) is not directly translated in the machine translation, but the meaning is conveyed through ""officially in war"" which is a suitable equivalent.
5. The phrase ""දෙකම"" (at) is not present in the machine translation, but it's implied in ""at war"" as a part of the phrase.

Overall, the machine translation captures the essence of the source text, but it omits the word ""at"" and does not explicitly use the phrase ""at war"" as the reference translation does.

Source: The main subject is ""බ්රේස් ගර්ඩ්ල්"" (Brace Girdle) and the action is ""අරක්ෂා කිරීමට"" (to protect).

Step 2: Compare the subject and action in the machine translation
Machine translation: The subject is ""Launched a workshop"" and the action is ""to protect Brace Girdle.""
- The subject is changed to ""a workshop"" instead of ""Brace Girdle.""
- The action is slightly different, as it mentions ""protecting"" Brace Girdle, but the context is not clear if it's the workshop or the girdle itself.

Step 3: Compare the subject and action in the reference translation
Reference translation: The subject is ""Brace Girdle"" and the action is ""launched a program to protect.""
- The subject is correct in this case.
- The action is also correct, indicating that Brace Girdle is the one launching the program.

Step 4: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation incorrectly attributes the workshop as the subject, while the reference translation correctly identifies Brace Girdle as the subject.
- The machine translation implies that a workshop was launched for protection, whereas the reference translation suggests that a program was launched.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the subject and the structure of the sentence.

|Analysis:|
1. The source text in Sinhala mentions ""වෙළුම් 1,893කින්"" (volume of 1,893), which is translated to ""with 1,893 bands"" in the machine translation. However, the reference translation correctly translates it as ""With a volume of 1,893 volumes,"" which is more accurate in the context of discussing a record.
2. The machine translation omits the word ""අතර"" (while) in the sentence, which is a conjunction that connects two clauses and is important for the flow of the sentence. The reference translation includes this conjunction, making the sentence clearer.
3. The machine translation uses ""is considered to be"" instead of a more direct translation like ""is"" in the reference translation. The reference is simpler and more direct, which might be more suitable for the context.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- Incorrect translation of ""වෙළුම්"" as ""bands"" instead of ""volumes.""

2. **Misinterpretation of ""අවබෝධය""**: The machine translation translates ""අවබෝධය"" as ""perception of the dictionary,"" which is not accurate. The word more likely refers to the concept or understanding of the Patichcha Samuppada, as the reference translation suggests.
3. **Lack of context**: The machine translation does not convey the idea of living in a state of samadhi (a deep meditative state) as the reference translation does. Instead, it implies a more general sense of community or understanding.

2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අල්ලාගන්න"" as ""capture,"" which is a more general term. In the context, it seems to refer to a specific operation or event, like capturing a territory (Jaffna) rather than an aircraft.
3. The reference translation specifies ""Jaffna,"" which is a location, while the machine translation does not provide this context.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation because it misinterprets the source text's meaning, specifically by translating ""අල්ලාගන්න"" as ""capture"" without the context of a specific location like Jaffna. The reference translation provides a more accurate representation of the source text's intent.

|Source: ඇය කාර්නැක්හි ඊජිප්තුවේ පුරාතන මහා දෙවඟන්|
|Machine translation: She replaced mut's landscape in the ancient great temple of Egypt in carnac.|
|Reference translation: She restored the territory of Mutt, the ancient great goddess of Egypt at Carnac.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""මුට්ගේ භූමිභාගය"" (mut's territory), which is a more specific term than ""landscape"" in the machine translation. The reference translation captures this by translating it as ""the territory of Mutt.""
2. The machine translation incorrectly uses ""replaced"" (අවසන්වා) which implies a change or removal, while the source and reference translations use ""sthāpanam"" (establishment or restoration), which suggests a return to its original state or a restoration.
3. The reference translation adds the title ""the ancient great goddess"" (පුරාතන මහා දෙවඟන්) to clarify the nature of Mutt, which is not present in the machine translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity (territory vs. landscape), the action (restoration vs. replacement), and the additional context provided (ancient great goddess). The reference translation is a more accurate and faithful representation of the source text.

Step 1: Identify the main subject and action in the source text
Source: ""දකුණු කෝෂිකාවේ"" (of the right ventricle) and ""බිත්ති trabeculae carneae"" (bordered by trabeculae carneae)

Step 2: Compare the subject in the machine translation to the source
Machine translation: ""The walls of the south coscia"" (incorrect, should be ""right ventricle"" as in the source)

Step 3: Compare the action in the machine translation to the source
Machine translation: ""are bordered by the trabeculae carneae"" (correct, matches the source)

Step 4: Identify the error in the machine translation
The error is in the translation of ""දකුණු"" (right) as ""south"" in the context of ""කෝෂිකාවේ"" (ventricle), which should be ""right ventricle"" to match the reference translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it incorrectly translates ""දකුණු"" as ""south"" instead of ""right."" The correct translation should be: ""The walls of the right ventricle are bordered by trabeculae carneae.""

The machine translation seems to have completely misunderstood the source text and produced a nonsensical output, which does not convey the meaning of the reference translation. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

1. **Source text analysis**: The source text discusses a specific characteristic of the author of ""Ratnavali,"" which is the use of parables (kathawarayaṇ) to explain their content.

2. **Machine translation analysis**: The machine translation appears to be a series of repeated ""maximus"" phrases, which is not a coherent translation or a meaningful representation of the source. It does not convey the concept of parables or the author's style.

3. **Reference translation analysis**: The reference translation accurately captures the meaning, stating that the author uses parables (kathawarayaṇ) as a method to explain their work.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not convey the intended meaning, instead producing a jumbled and irrelevant string of words. The reference translation is clear and concise, highlighting the author's use of parables, while the machine translation fails to do so.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The first gulf war caused Iraq to be completely destroyed.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Iraq was completely destroyed by the First Gulf War.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text uses ""අපිටියුද්ධය"" (apitiyuddaya) for ""the first gulf war"" and ""අවිනාශය"" (avinashaya) for ""complete destruction.""
- The machine translation uses ""the first gulf war"" and ""caused Iraq to be completely destroyed,"" which is a passive construction.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The reference translation uses an active construction, ""Iraq was completely destroyed by the First Gulf War,"" which is more direct and clear.

Step 6: Identify the differences
- The machine translation uses a passive construction, which might make it sound less direct and could potentially imply that the cause is unclear.
- The reference translation uses the active construction, which clearly attributes the destruction to the First Gulf War.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its choice of construction (passive vs. active) and the clarity of the cause. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text in terms of conveying the direct action of the First Gulf War on Iraq's destruction.

   - Reference translation: The sentence structure is clearer and more natural.

Based on this analysis, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:
- It uses ""kin dynasty"" instead of ""Yin Dynasty"" (which is the correct term).
- The sentence structure and emphasis on the specific period are not as clear as in the reference translation.

Step 1: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- ""1995 වසරේදී"" (In the year 1995)
- ""දෙවැනි"" (Second)
- ""විශේෂ"" (Special)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: ""The 2nd special cavalry diving team was established in 1995.""
Reference translation: ""In 1995, the Second Special Forces Diving Team was formed.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation uses ""established"" which implies a creation or setting up, while the reference translation uses ""formed"" which is more appropriate for a military unit, suggesting the formation of a team.
- The machine translation omits the word ""cavalry"" and instead uses ""diving team"" which is not accurate, as the source text specifically mentions ""බළකායේ"" (cavalry) which refers to a type of unit.
- The reference translation adds ""Special Forces"" to clarify that it's a specialized diving team, which is not present in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the choice of words (""established"" vs ""formed""), the inclusion of ""cavalry"" and the addition of ""Special Forces"" to provide context.

|Reference translation:| The various monuments originally made for the queen were later re-engraved for Akinatan 's daughters, Meritaten and Ankhesenpaten.

|Analysis:|
1. **Source**: The source text refers to ""මුලින්"" (original) and ""අක්නාටන්ගේ"" (Akhnaten's), which are specific to the context of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhnaten and his daughters.
2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""මුලින්"" as ""originally built for the descendants"" and omits the connection to Akhnaten. It also incorrectly refers to ""meritaten and ankhsenpaten"" as ""daughters"" and suggests they were rebuilt for a cathedral, which is not accurate.
3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation correctly identifies the monuments as originally made for the queen, and specifies that they were re-engraved for Akinatan's daughters, Meritaten, and Ankhesenpaten.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation by:
- Misinterpreting the original context of the monuments as being for descendants instead of a queen.
- Incorrectly translating ""මුලින්"" and ""අක්නාටන්ගේ"" to imply a different relationship.

|Reference translation:| Therefore, it is clear that if there were any philosophical attitudes that were perceived to be correct, they were to be considered and followed as concepts of the season.|

|Analysis|
1. **""මේ නිසා""** (This way) - Machine translation: ""If there are some"" - The source phrase refers to a specific situation or context, while the machine translation generalizes it to ""if there are some.""
2. **""නිවැරදි""** (fall correctly) - Machine translation: ""fall correctly"" - The reference translation uses ""were perceived to be correct,"" which implies an evaluation of correctness rather than a literal falling.
3. **""වැටහුනු""** (that were perceived) - Machine translation: ""they were generalized"" - The machine translation omits this part, which is crucial for understanding the context of the perceived correctness.
4. **""යම්කිසි""** (philosophical attitudes) - Both translations: ""philosophical attitudes"" - This part is consistent.
5. **""දාර්ශනික""** (philosophical) - Both translations: ""philosophical"" - Consistent.
6. **""අකල්පයක්""** (attitudes) - Machine translation: ""concepts"" - The machine translation simplifies the meaning, as ""අකල්පය"" can also refer to ideas or principles, not just concepts.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its generalization of the situation, the loss of the context about perceived correctness, and the simplification of the term ""අකල්පය"" to ""concepts.""

**Analysis:**

1. **Subject and action**: The source text mentions ""විසින්"" (visin), which is a Sinhala word that refers to ""by"" or ""in the context of"" in this context. The machine translation omits this, resulting in ""A January 1815 article by John Adams addressing James Loyd,"" which suggests a standalone article rather than a letter.

2. **Time expression**: The source uses ""මස"" (mas) to indicate the month, which is translated as ""January"" in the reference translation. The machine translation correctly translates this as ""January 1815.""

3. **Letter vs. article**: The source specifies that it's a letter, but the machine translation incorrectly assumes it's an article. The reference translation correctly identifies it as a letter.

4. **Addressing**: The source includes ""මගින්"" (magine), which implies the act of addressing, but the machine translation does not convey this explicitly. The reference translation includes ""addressing"" to clarify the action.

In summary, the machine translation loses the context of a letter and the act of addressing, which are important elements in the original source. The reference translation captures these nuances, making it a more accurate representation of the source text.

2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""පසෙකට"" (beside) as ""stuck alongside"", which implies a physical obstruction, while the reference translation suggests the aircraft tilted, which is a different situation.
3. The machine translation omits the part about the aircraft tilting, which is crucial for understanding the context of the temperature data transmission.
4. The reference translation uses ""tilted to a side"" to convey the action, which is more accurate than the machine's ""stuck alongside"".

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In 918 and by 936 it had become the ruling dynasty of Korea.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation combines the two time points (918 and 936) into a single phrase ""by 936,"" which suggests a sudden transition, while the reference translation separates them with ""and"" and uses ""had become"" to indicate a completed action by 936.
- The machine translation omits the ""වන"" (by) after 936, which is necessary to convey the meaning that the event was completed by that time in the reference translation.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality
The machine translation is not entirely accurate in conveying the time frame and the progressive nature of the action. The reference translation provides a clearer and more natural English sentence structure, reflecting the intended meaning of the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation could be improved by separating the time points and using a more precise phrasing to indicate the progressive action up to 936.

- The source text mentions ""මේ සදහා"" (this forum) and ""මුලින්ම අදහස්"" (initial intention) and ""ජෝජ් ලෝ"" (Jorge Lowe).
- The machine translation correctly identifies ""This forum"" and ""Jorge Lowe"" but uses ""intended"" instead of the more appropriate Sinhala term ""අදහස්"" (intent).

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation omits the Sinhala term ""අදහස්"" and instead uses ""intended,"" which is not a direct translation of the original concept.
- The reference translation uses ""was the first to comment"" which is a more accurate representation of the source's meaning, while the machine translation uses ""first intended.""

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not directly translate the term ""අදහස්"" (intent) and instead uses ""intended,"" which may not convey the same meaning. Additionally, the reference translation captures the action of commenting, while the machine translation suggests a passive intention. The overall quality of the translation could be improved by using a more accurate term for ""අදහස්"" and maintaining the active aspect of the action.

2. The only difference is the inclusion of a single quote (') in the reference translation after ""July 11, 1788"", which is not present in the machine translation. This is a minor formatting issue and does not affect the core meaning of the sentence.
3. The machine translation correctly translates the Sinhala phrase ""ඇමෙරිකා එක්සත් ජනපදය"" as ""the United States of America"" in English.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of good quality overall, with only a minor formatting difference from the reference translation. The main content and meaning are accurately conveyed.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

|Source: පළාත් අටෙහි නම් අදටත් එක් ආකාරයකින් හෝ වෙනත් ආකාරයකින් සංරක්ෂිත ව පවතී|
|Machine translation: The names of the eight regions are still preserved in one way or another today.|
|Reference translation: The names of the eight provinces are still preserved in one way or another.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""අටෙහි"" (provinces), not ""regions"" as in the machine translation. This is a key difference, as ""provinces"" is a more accurate term for the context in Sinhala, referring to the administrative divisions of Sri Lanka.
2. The source text uses ""අදටත්"" (today), which is a more natural way to express the present time in Sinhala. The machine translation omits this, making it sound like the preservation is a general fact rather than a current state.
3. The reference translation simplifies the structure by removing the ""today"" part, but it still conveys the intended meaning.

Overall, the machine translation loses some accuracy in terms of the specific reference to provinces and the time frame, while the reference translation provides a more direct and accurate translation for the Sinhala text.

|Machine translation: He or the volunteers of the U.S. Army and militia troops of time gunships|
|Reference translation: Neither he nor any of the volunteers and militiamen in the U.S. Army|

Difference: The machine translation omits the word ""knew"" and the concept of ""time guns"" being a specific type of military equipment, instead referring to them as ""gunships"" which is a broader term. The reference translation specifies that the individuals didn't know how to operate these time guns.

|Source: බල ඇණි විධි විධාන|
|Machine translation: battalions, and so on|
|Reference translation: operate time guns, battalions, and so on|

Difference: The machine translation simply lists ""battalions"" without the context of ""time guns"" and the implied inability to operate them. The reference translation includes the operation aspect and the list of related military units.

Overall, the machine translation is less accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text, particularly in terms of the specific knowledge or lack thereof about operating time guns and the distinction between gunships and battalions. The reference translation provides a clearer and more precise translation.

Machine translation: After that, the plebiscite of the temples was met with historical records.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: After that, historical records including the inscriptions of the temples are found.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""the plebiscite of the temples was met with historical records,"" which suggests a vote or consultation took place, while the source text does not mention a plebiscite. The reference translation correctly translates ""අභිලේඛන"" as ""including the inscriptions"" and does not imply a vote.
- The source text uses ""අතුළු"" which means ""specific"" or ""particular,"" but the machine translation does not capture this nuance, referring to ""historical records"" as if they were a single entity.
- The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of ""අභිලේඛන"" as ""historical records"" and includes the context of ""including the inscriptions of the temples.""

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in that it incorrectly implies a plebiscite took place, omits the nuance of ""අතුළු"" (specific), and does not explicitly mention the inscriptions of the temples. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text.

Source: මොවුන් අන්තිම දිළින්දන් වූ අතර යාන්තමට දිවි ගැට ගසා ගැනීමට තරම් ආදායමක් ලද්දෝ වූහ.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: They were the last sparks and barely had enough revenue to survive.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: These were the last of the poor who made barely enough to make a living.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text talks about ""මොවුන්"" (they) being the last ""දිළින්දන්"" (sparks) and having a specific difficulty, which is ""දිවි ගැට"" (barely making ends meet) and needing ""අදායමක්"" (aid) to continue.
- The machine translation translates ""අන්තිම"" (last) as ""last sparks"" and ""දිළින්දන්"" (poor) as ""the last sparks,"" which is a literal but not a perfect fit. It also translates ""අතර"" (and) as ""and"" and ""දිවි ගැට"" (barely making ends meet) as ""barely had enough revenue to survive,"" which is a similar but not identical concept.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation omits the reference to ""අතර"" (and) and the context of ""අන්තිම"" (last) being related to the poor, which is present in the source text.
- The reference translation uses ""the last of the poor"" to convey the same idea as ""අන්තිම"" (last) and ""දිළින්දන්"" (poor), which is more accurate.
- The reference translation also captures the idea of ""barely enough to make a living"" more precisely than the machine translation, which uses ""barely had enough revenue to survive.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of context and the specific reference to the poor. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuance of the source text, while the machine translation is a literal but less accurate representation.

|Machine translation: The new wealthy settlers came to acquire large land|
|Reference translation: New wealthy settlers came to acquire large tracts of land|

Analysis:
1. The source text uses the term ""අලුත් ධනවත්"" which refers to ""new arrivals"" or ""settlers"" in Sinhala. The machine translation captures this as ""new wealthy settlers,"" which is accurate.
2. The source text uses ""පදිංචිකරුවෝ"" which means ""to acquire"" or ""to gain"" in Sinhala. The machine translation correctly translates this as ""came to acquire.""
3. The main difference lies in the translation of ""විශාල ඉඩම්"" which means ""large area"" or ""large tract"" in Sinhala. The machine translation simply says ""large land,"" which is less precise than the reference translation, which specifies ""tracts of land.""

In conclusion, the machine translation captures the main idea but loses some nuance by not specifying ""tracts"" in the context of land acquisition. The overall meaning is similar, but the reference translation is clearer and more accurate in this case.

|Machine translation: Since 2009, Korean organizations, including the Japanese government, have requested a judgment on the murder of Min Abbey.
|Reference translation: Since 2009 , Korean organizations have been demanding a verdict on the assassination of the head queen Ming by the Japanese government.

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""අගබිසවගේ"" (agabbisava), which is likely a reference to a specific event or person, possibly a queen or a leader. The machine translation translates this as ""the murder of Min Abbey,"" which is a direct translation but might be incorrect or a misinterpretation, as it does not convey the same level of specificity or context.
2. The machine translation omits the term ""අධිරාජය"" (adhiraajya), which means ""head queen"" or ""queen regent"" in Sinhala. This is a crucial detail that is missing in the translation, as it changes the nature of the event from a murder to an assassination, which is a more serious crime.
3. The reference translation uses ""demanding a verdict"" (demanding a judgment), which is a more accurate representation of the verb ""විනිශ්චයක්"" (vinischaya) in Sinhala, as it implies an ongoing action and a desire for a specific outcome.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the event as a murder instead of an assassination, and in the omission of the term ""අධිරාජය"" which is crucial for understanding the context. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuance of the source text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: But by the middle of the 14th century, the Yuan dynasty was falling.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: But by the middle of the 14th century, the Yuan dynasty was collapsing.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""falling"" while the reference translation uses ""collapsing."" The difference in these words suggests a slightly different level of intensity or progression. ""Falling"" implies a gradual descent, whereas ""collapsing"" implies a more sudden and dramatic decline.

Step 5: Analyze the quality
The machine translation is not entirely inaccurate, but it does lose some nuance in the description of the Yuan dynasty's decline. The reference translation conveys a stronger sense of the dynasty's instability and eventual end.

Conclusion: The machine translation could be improved by using a term that more accurately reflects the intensity and finality of the Yuan dynasty's collapse, such as ""collapsing"" instead of ""falling."" This would enhance the quality of the translation and make it more faithful to the reference text.

|Reference translation: The Tamil Nadu government has imposed a 30 % entertainment tax on non-e|

Analysis:

1. The source text refers to ""නාන්"" (nan) which is a colloquial term for ""non-e"" or ""non-essential"" goods or services, typically used in the context of taxation. The machine translation translates this as ""nan e"" which is not a standard English term and might be a mistranslation or an attempt to convey a similar meaning.

2. The verb ""පනවන"" (panavan) in the source text means ""imposed"" or ""introduced"" in the context of a tax. The machine translation uses ""established,"" which might imply a more permanent setup, whereas ""imposed"" is a more accurate term for the action of introducing a tax.

3. The reference translation correctly uses ""non-e"" to represent the colloquial term ""නාන්"" and uses ""has imposed"" to convey the action of the government.

Overall, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the colloquial term ""nan"" and the choice of verb ""established"" instead of ""imposed."" The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the source text.

The machine translation, however, incorrectly translates this as ""disadvantage"" and ""travelling helicopters using a mirror,"" which does not convey the intended meaning of the source.

2. The machine translation omits the crucial information about the purpose of using a mirror, which is to catch the attention of the helicopters. The reference translation includes this detail, making it more accurate.

|Step 1: Understand the source text|
The source text in Sinhala discusses the impact of labdāyitvaya (profitability) and gūṇatvaya (quality) on ""මිල"" (price), ""පරරබේතිපත්තිය"" (parabolism), and ""වෙළඳපොල"" (market sales). It suggests that these factors are crucial in determining these aspects.

|Step 2: Compare machine translation with source text|
Machine translation: ""Profitability and quality of price parabolism and market sales are affected to decide.""
- The machine translation attempts to convey the idea that profitability and quality are influenced by price parabolism and market sales, but it uses the phrase ""are affected to decide"" which is not accurate. The source text implies that these factors determine the profitability and quality, not that they are decided by them.

|Step 3: Compare machine translation with reference translation|
Reference translation: ""Price paradigm and market sales determine profitability and quality.""
- The reference translation correctly captures the relationship, stating that price paradigm and market sales are the determining factors for profitability and quality, which aligns with the source text.

|Step 4: Identify differences|
- The main difference lies in the verb choice. The machine translation uses ""are affected to decide,"" which is a passive construction that suggests a decision-making process, whereas the reference translation uses ""determine,"" which implies a cause-and-effect relationship.

|Step 5: Conclusion|
The machine translation could be improved by using the phrase ""determine"" instead of ""are affected to decide"" to better align with the source text's meaning. The reference translation accurately reflects the source's intent, focusing on the factors that decide profitability and quality rather than their impact on a decision.|

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: It also supplies milk to about 70,000 dairy farmers for total production

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the source text, ""කිරිගොවීන්"" refers to ""dairy farmers"" or ""milkgoers"" in Sinhala, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""milkgoers"" without specifying they are dairy farmers.
- The source text mentions ""සමස්ථ නිෂ්පාදනයට"" which means ""for total production"" or ""to the entire process,"" whereas the machine translation says ""to the entire product,"" which is not as precise.
- The reference translation uses ""dairy farmers"" and ""total production,"" which are more accurate and contextually appropriate than the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not specify that the milkgoers are dairy farmers and uses a less precise term for the purpose of milk supply. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the source text.

|Analysis:|
1. **Competitive doubts**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අවස්ථාවේ"" (with) as ""competitive"" which is not accurate. The source text does not mention a competitive aspect, but rather refers to the doubts or consequences associated with sugar use.
2. **Diabetic doubts**: The machine translation uses ""diabetic doubts"" which is not found in the source. The source text refers to ""දියවැඩියාව"" (doubts) which is more likely to imply health concerns related to diabetes.
3. **Cardiovascular disease**: The machine translation correctly mentions this term.
4. **Dimensional disease**: The source text does not have a direct equivalent for ""dimensional disease"" in the reference translation. It might be a mistranslation or an error.
5. **Eyes invisibility**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අස්වාදය"" (blindness) as ""eyes invisibility."" The reference translation correctly uses ""blindness.""
6. **Tooth decay**: Both the machine and reference translations correctly mention this.

In summary, the machine translation has issues with the interpretation of ""අවස්ථාවේ"" (with), ""dimensional disease,"" and the mistranslation of ""අස්වාදය"" (blindness). The reference translation better captures the intended meaning of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: 2001 මැයි වන විට සුන් බුන් අස් කිරීම නිල වශයෙන් අවසාන විය.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: By May 2001, Sun Boone was officially endorsed.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: By May 2001, the demolition of the wreckage had officially ended.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""සුන් බුන්"" (Sun Boone), which is a proper noun, while the machine translation translates it as ""Sun Boone"" without specifying it as a proper noun.
- The source text uses ""අස් කිරීම"" (demolition), which is the act of removing or destroying something, while the machine translation translates it as ""endorsed,"" which is unrelated to the context of demolition.
- The source text states that the act was ""අවසාන"" (ended) due to ""අස් කිරීම"" (demolition) being ""නිල"" (nil, meaning not present or completed), while the machine translation does not convey this connection.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of the source text by translating ""අස් කිරීම"" (demolition) and ""අවසාන"" (ended) in the context of the wreckage.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it incorrectly translates ""අස් කිරීම"" (demolition) as ""endorsed"" and does not convey the connection between the end of the act and the source text's context. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

|Source:| කෙසේ වෙතත්, සම්ප්රදායයන් ඇති කුරුල්ලන් කීපයක් kashrut තත්ත්වය පිළිබඳ පවතී.|
|Machine translation:| However, a few birds with traditions are available on kashrut status.|
|Reference translation:| However , there are a few birds with traditions about kashrut status.|

|Analysis:|
1. **Difference in structure**: The machine translation uses ""on kashrut status"" as a prepositional phrase, while the reference translation uses ""about kashrut status"" to describe the birds' traditions. This change in structure slightly alters the meaning, as the reference implies that the birds have traditions related to kashrut, whereas the machine translation suggests they are available in a state of kashrut.

2. **Omission of ""about""**: The machine translation omits the word ""about"" in the phrase ""with traditions about kashrut status,"" which is crucial for conveying the idea that the birds have specific traditions regarding kashrut.

3. **Word order**: The word order in the machine translation is slightly different, with ""a few birds"" coming before ""with traditions,"" while the reference places ""there are"" before ""a few birds."" This difference is less significant, but it affects the flow of the sentence.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of structure, specifically the way it describes the birds' relationship to kashrut traditions, and the omission of the word ""about."" These differences affect the clarity and accuracy of the translation.

|Machine translation:| Commercial versus fungi can be used to prevent it from destroying fungi.|
|Reference translation:| Commercial anti-fungal remedies can be used to prevent the spread of fungal infections.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""කොමර්ෂල් විරෝධී"" (commercially available) and ""දිලීර්"" (antifungal), which are specific terms related to preventing fungal growth or infections.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""දිලීර්"" as ""fungi"" (which is a plural term), suggesting a comparison between commercial products and fungi themselves, rather than the intended meaning of antifungal remedies.
3. The machine translation also omits the context of ""විනාශ"" (prevention) and ""පැතිර"" (to prevent), which are crucial for understanding the purpose of using the commercial remedies.
4. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning by translating ""දිලීර්"" as ""anti-fungal remedies"" and includes the context of preventing the spread of fungal infections.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation because it incorrectly identifies the antifungal nature of the product and misunderstands the context of preventing fungal growth, leading to a less accurate and coherent sentence. The reference translation better reflects the meaning of the source text.

Machine translation: Eventually, their marriage was on the need of the mouse.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Eventually their marriage took place at the request of the parents.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation has a phrase ""on the need of the mouse"" which does not have a direct equivalent in the source text or the reference translation.
- The reference translation correctly conveys the idea that the marriage happened due to the request or involvement of the parents, which is ""විවාහය සිදු විය"" in the source text.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation mistranslates ""මවුපියන්ගේ උවමනාව"" (the mouse's need) as ""on the need of the mouse,"" which is not a suitable phrase in this context.
- The reference translation captures the meaning of ""මාත්‍ර"" (eventually) and ""මවුපියන්ගේ"" (parents') correctly.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it incorrectly translates the phrase ""මවුපියන්ගේ උවමනාව"" as ""on the need of the mouse,"" while the reference translation accurately conveys the marriage taking place at the request of the parents. The overall quality of the machine translation is lower due to this inaccuracy.

|Machine translation: The real satisfaction is that the soil is not only satisfactory but also satisfactory.|
|Reference translation: Only when so satisfied is it realized that true satisfaction is not .|

|Analysis:|
1. The source text is discussing the realization of true satisfaction, which is not something that can be directly equated to the satisfaction of the soil.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""සැබෑ"" (satisfied) as ""satisfactory"" twice, leading to redundancy and a loss of meaning.
3. The phrase ""අවිස්සාවේ"" (not) is missing in the machine translation, which is crucial to convey the negation of the realization of true satisfaction.
4. The structure of the sentence is also altered, with the machine translation placing ""not only satisfactory but also satisfactory"" in a way that does not match the original context.

|Conclusion:|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of meaning, redundancy, and sentence structure. It fails to convey the intended message about the realization of true satisfaction not being a given, and instead presents a redundant and incorrect interpretation of the source text.|im_end|

|Reference translation: That is, chlorophyll is caused by the ingestion of an organism, such as a cyanobacteria.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""මාත්‍යා"" (ingestion) which is not present in the machine translation. Instead, the machine translation incorrectly uses ""monitoring"" which does not convey the same meaning as the source.
2. The source text mentions ""මාත්‍යාවක්"" (an organism), which is translated to ""a species"" in the machine translation, but the context is about the ingestion, not just a species.
3. The machine translation incorrectly states that the cyanobacterium is ""green"" in the process, which is not mentioned in the source. The source implies that chlorophyll is involved, but it does not specify the color of the cyanobacterium.
4. The reference translation correctly translates ""මාත්‍යාවක්"" as ""an organism"" and connects it to the cause of chlorophyll, which is the key point in the source.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the meaning of ingestion, the context of the cyanobacterium, and the connection to chlorophyll. The reference translation better captures the intended meaning of the source text.

- The reference translation uses ""has been damaged"" (present perfect tense) which indicates a completed action, while the machine translation uses ""was damaged"" (past tense), which suggests a past event.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation captures the meaning of the source text more accurately, using ""looting"" and the present perfect tense to indicate the ongoing or completed nature of the damage.

|Source: මීට අමතරව, කිරීටක කෝඨරකයෙක් |
|Machine translation: the kiryataka reporter |
|Reference translation: the coronary artery |

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it translates ""කිරීටක කෝඨරකය"" (kiryataka kōdaraka) as ""the kiryataka reporter"" instead of ""the coronary artery"". This is a mistranslation, as ""කිරීටක"" (kiryataka) is a term that likely refers to a specific type of artery in the Sinhala context, but the machine has not accurately identified it as such.

|Source: මයෝකාඩියමේ ඔක්සිජනීහෘත රුධිරය |
|Machine translation: oxygenated blood of the miocardium |
|Reference translation: oxygenated blood from the myocardium |

Here, the machine translation is accurate in identifying ""මයෝකාඩියමේ"" (myokādīyame) as ""from the myocardium"" and ""ඔක්සිජනීහෘත"" (oksijanēhitha) as ""oxygenated"". However, it uses ""miocardium"" instead of ""right atrium"" as in the reference translation.

|Source: ලබා දෙයි |
|Machine translation: return the oxygenated blood |
|Reference translation: returns |

The verb ""ලබා"" (labā) in the source text means ""to receive"" or ""to take in"" in this context, not ""to return"". The reference translation correctly uses ""returns"" to indicate the action of the coronary artery.

Overall analysis:
1. The machine translation incorrectly identifies ""කිරීටක කෝඨරකය"" as ""the kiryataka reporter"" instead of ""coronary artery.""
2. It accurately translates the concept of ""oxygenated blood from the myocardium.""
3. The verb ""to receive"" is not accurately translated as ""return"" in the context of blood flow.

To improve the quality of the translation, the machine should recognize ""කිරීටක"" as a type of artery and translate it as ""coronary artery,"" and use the correct verb to describe the blood flow, which would be ""returns"" rather than ""return.""

Analysis:
1. The source text is in Sinhala, discussing the difference between the surface of Venus (පෘථීවි) and the Earth (අපිට).

4. The reference translation correctly uses the possessive form ""Earth's surface"" to make the comparison.

In conclusion, the machine translation is significantly different from the reference translation due to the incorrect identification of ""පෘථීවි"" as ""Fridays"" and the lack of a possessive reference to the Earth's surface.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""දිවාරි"" (Divari) as the island, while the machine translation uses ""dayan"" which is likely a mistake.
- The source text refers to ""පිහිටි"" (attachment) or ""පියාගේ"" (belonging to the father) for the father's home, but the machine translation does not capture this context accurately.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""he"" as ""අතුමන්"" (Ethman) and uses the phrase ""in his father's home"" to convey the relationship.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The main difference is the island name, which should be ""Divari"" in both translations.
- The reference translation better captures the relationship between the father's home and the island.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the island name (dayan vs. Divari) and the clarity of the relationship between the father's home and the island. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

- The source text mentions ""විශදු ලප"" (blemishes) and ""නිරන්තරයෙන්"" (frequent exposure) which are not directly translated in the machine translation.
- The machine translation uses ""peculiar laps"" which is not a direct translation of ""විශදු ලප"" and implies a different context.
- The machine translation mentions ""consumer problems"" which is not as specific as ""chronic problems"" in the reference translation.
- The reference translation includes ""such as inflammation"" which is not present in the machine translation.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""Next connected to the initial mission, initially LTD,"" which seems to be a literal translation of the source text, but it does not convey the intended meaning accurately.
- The reference translation correctly identifies ""Mullaitivu"" as the location and ""L.T.T.E"" as an abbreviation, which is likely referring to the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) in the context of a military operation.
- The machine translation omits the context of a military operation and the abbreviation, which are crucial for understanding the source.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation does not mention ""operation"" or provide the full abbreviation ""L.T.T.E.""
- The reference translation provides a clearer context and a more accurate representation of the source.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of context and the specific details it conveys.

|Machine translation: The period to use euro was used for Vatican coins and ringing similar to the Italian Lira|
|Reference translation: Prior to the use of the euro, Vatican coins and stamps used the Vatican lira, similar to the Italian lira|

|Analysis|
1. **Timeframe**: The machine translation incorrectly refers to ""ringing"" (which is not mentioned in the source) as if it were a type of currency or item that used the euro. The reference translation correctly uses ""Prior to the use of the euro"" to describe the timeframe.
2. **Subject**: The source mentions ""vatican coins and stamps"" (කාසි හා මුද්දර), while the machine translation omits ""stamps"" and incorrectly combines ""coins"" with ""ringing."" The reference translation includes both ""coins"" and ""stamps.""
3. **Currency**: The machine translation incorrectly refers to ""ringing"" as if it were a currency, while the reference translation correctly identifies ""Vatican lira"" as the currency used.
4. **Comparison**: Both the source and the reference translation compare the Vatican lira to the Italian lira, but the machine translation incorrectly uses ""similar to the Italian Lira"" for both coins and ringing, which is not accurate.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of the timeframe, subject (omission of stamps and incorrect association with ringing), and clarity in describing the currency used. The reference translation provides a more accurate and faithful representation of the source text.

|Machine translation: But we couldn't make a decision on that, Hayes handed it over to Alan Horne for Disney.|
|Reference translation: But since we could not make a decision on that, it was handed over to Alan Horn on behalf of Disney.|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation starts with ""But we couldn't make a decision on that,"" which is accurate.
2. The phrase ""Hayes handed it over to Alan Horne"" is correct, but the machine translation adds ""for Disney"" at the end, which is not present in the source text. The reference translation correctly omits this phrase, implying that the handover was done on Disney's behalf without specifying the reason.
3. The reference translation includes ""since we could not make a decision on that,"" which provides context and is not in the machine translation.

Overall, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it adds unnecessary information (""for Disney"") and omits the context provided by ""since."" The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

|Source: අධිරාජකීය චෝළ රාජවංශයේ අගනුවර බවට තන්ජවූර් පත් විය|
|Machine translation: Tanjavur became the capital of the imperial chola dynasty|
|Reference translation: Thanjavur became the capital of the imperial Chola dynasty|
|Analysis:|
1. The source text uses ""අධිරාජකීය"" (imperial) in Sinhala, which is translated to ""imperial"" in both the machine and reference translations. This part is consistent.
2. ""චෝළ"" (Chola) is a proper noun referring to the Chola dynasty, and it is transliterated to ""chola"" in both machine and reference translations. However, the reference translation capitalizes ""Chola,"" which is a common practice for proper nouns in English. The machine translation does not capitalize it.
3. ""රාජවංශයේ"" (of the dynasty) is translated to ""of the"" in both machine and reference translations, but the reference adds a space before ""imperial"" to clarify the relationship, which is not present in the machine translation.
4. ""අගනුවර"" (became the capital) is translated to ""became the capital"" in both machine and reference translations, which is accurate.

In summary, the main difference is the capitalization of ""Chola"" in the reference translation, which is a minor stylistic difference. The core meaning and structure of the sentence are consistent between the machine and reference translations. The machine translation could be improved by capitalizing ""Chola"" to match the reference. Overall, the quality of the translation is good, but with a minor adjustment for better clarity.

|Machine translation: Rather than in western countries, this salad plant is used for various kinds of food taxonomy|
|Reference translation: Compared to western countries, this salad plant is used for a variety of dishes|
|Analysis:|
1. **Difference in meaning**: The machine translation uses ""food taxonomy"" which is a technical term referring to the classification of food, while the reference translation simply states ""a variety of dishes."" The source text does not mention taxonomy but rather implies a wide range of culinary uses.
2. **Omission of context**: The source text starts with ""වඩා"" (Rather than), which suggests a contrast with something else, like ""western countries."" The machine translation omits this contrast, making the sentence less clear.
3. **Word choice**: ""විවිධ"" in the source text means ""various"" or ""diverse,"" which is accurately translated as ""a variety"" in the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation loses some nuance and context from the source text, focusing more on the technical aspect of food classification rather than the culinary applications. The reference translation better captures the intended meaning and comparison with western countries.

|reference_translation| Here the pamphlet discovered by the protagonist is used as a hint to find additional information written in handwriting and typing.|

Analysis:
1. **Source**: The source text refers to ""කථා නායකයා"" (protagonist) discovering a ""ලඝුලේඛනය"" (pamphlet).
2. **Machine Translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""කථා නායකයා"" as ""lagrange"" and ""ලඝුලේඛනය"" as ""a lagrange"" instead of a ""pamphlet."" It also incorrectly mentions ""keyword"" instead of ""typing"" for the type of information.
3. **Reference Translation**: The reference translation correctly translates ""කථා නායකයා"" as ""protagonist"" and ""ලඝුලේඛනය"" as ""pamphlet."" It uses the correct terms ""handwriting"" and ""typing"" to describe the information.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in several aspects: it misinterprets the subject as a ""lagrange"" instead of a ""protagonist"" and a ""pamphlet,"" and it incorrectly uses ""keyword"" instead of ""typing"" to describe the type of information. The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation.

|Machine translation: In 1763 the appointed royal announcement of the western colonies of the Appalachian Mountains was temporarily suspended.|
|Reference translation: A royal proclamation issued in 1763 temporarily prohibited the establishment of western settlements in the Appalachian Mountains.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""අපලේචියන්ගේ"" (of the western colonies), which is not accurately translated as ""of the Appalachian Mountains"" in the machine translation. The machine translation omits the connection to the colonies.
2. The machine translation uses ""appointed royal announcement"" which is a less precise term than ""royal proclamation"" in the reference translation. The reference translation specifies that it's a proclamation, which is a more common term for such an official statement.
3. The machine translation states ""was temporarily suspended,"" while the reference translation says ""temporarily prohibited the establishment."" The reference is clearer about the action being taken (prohibition) and the purpose (establishment of settlements).

Overall, the machine translation loses some context and precision compared to the reference translation. It would be more accurate to say: ""1763වනුග්ගාරින්, අපලේචියන්ගේ බටහිර ජනාවාසයේ ත临时禁止了在阿巴拉契亚山脉设立西方殖民地的皇家公告.""

2. The machine translation omits the word ""වලා"" (hidden) from the source, which is crucial for conveying the meaning that the search is for weapons that are concealed.
3. The phrase ""ගැන"" (for) is translated as ""hidden"" in the MT, which is not correct. It should be translated as ""in the context of"" or ""while looking for"" to indicate the purpose of the search.
4. The reference translation uses ""which are hidden"" to clarify that the artillery is an example of the large weapons being sought, while the MT does not explicitly connect the artillery to being hidden.

Overall, the machine translation is missing important context and nuances, leading to a less accurate representation of the source text compared to the reference translation.

|Machine translation: Since the external eating of many animals is distinct only outside the ""eating"" often seen using its external part.
|Reference translation: The word ""ear"" is often used to refer to the outer part of most animals, as only the outer ear is visible.

Analysis:
1. The source text is about the usage of the word ""කන"" (ear) in the context of animals, specifically referring to the external part that is visible.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""කන"" as ""eating"" and then refers to the external part being used for that purpose, which is not accurate.
3. The reference translation correctly identifies the word ""ear"" and explains that it is often used to refer to the outer part, which is visible.

Differences:
- Machine translation: Incorrectly translates ""කන"" as ""eating"" and focuses on the act of eating, whereas the reference translation correctly identifies it as ""ear.""
- Machine translation: Misinterprets the usage of the word ""කන"" as a tool for external eating, while the reference translation explains that it is used to refer to the visible outer part.

To improve the quality of the machine translation, it should focus on accurately translating the word ""කන"" as ""ear"" and conveying the context that it is the external part that is commonly referred to, not the act of eating.

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""වංශවතුන්"" (vannashavatun) which means ""aristocrats"" or ""noble families"" in Sinhala. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""unofficial officers"" or ""forerunner to the medals,"" which is not a suitable equivalent.

The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""unconscious carrion spots in the intelligence services,"" which is unrelated to the original meaning.
2. **Buddhist reference**: The machine translation does not capture the metaphorical meaning of ""බුද්ධ්‍රාවියාවේම"" (as a Buddha) and instead translates it as ""intelligence services,"" which is a literal and incorrect interpretation.
3. **Scattering Buddhism**: The phrase ""වැඩ සිටි"" (scattering) is not translated accurately, and the context of ""八十 cubits of Buddhism"" is lost in the machine translation.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: A range of advanced individuals who have been welcomed for their contributions have missed this.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Many of the elite who were thus recognized for their contributions have thus missed out.

Step 4: Compare the differences
1. In the source text, ""මෙලෙස"" (thus) is not directly translated in the machine translation, which affects the meaning of the sentence.
2. The machine translation uses ""a range of advanced individuals"" while the reference translation refers to ""the elite."" This is a significant difference in the context, as ""මෙලෙස"" implies a specific group, not just any advanced individuals.
3. The phrase ""රාශියක්"" (missed) is translated as ""have missed"" in both, but the reference translation adds ""out"" after it, which is not present in the machine translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the specific group being referred to (elite vs. advanced individuals) and the inclusion of the word ""thus"" to emphasize the recognition.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: King of Elephants, ""Deviani, what do we know?""

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Then the king said, ""God, to whom shall we give donations?""

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text starts with ""එකල්හි රජතුමා"" (King of Elephants), which is correctly translated as ""King of Elephants"" in the machine translation.
- The source text then asks a question, ""දේවියනි, අපි කා හට නම් දන් දෙමුද"" (Deviani, what do we know?). The machine translation has ""what do we know?"" which is a direct translation of the Sinhala question, but it is missing the context of the question being addressed to Deviani.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation adds the context of the king speaking, ""Then the king said,"" which is not present in the machine translation.
- The reference translation also changes the structure of the question to ""God, to whom shall we give donations?"" which better captures the meaning of the original Sinhala question, asking about the recipient of donations.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of context and structure. It omits the king's address and the implied question about the recipient of donations, making it less clear than the reference translation. The machine translation could be improved by including the context and rephrasing the question to match the reference translation.

1. **Source Text**: The source text is in Sinhala and talks about a clay image found in a place called ""Urvali"" or ""Ur"" (assuming it's a Sinhala spelling of the same word), mentioning that it has similar features to something else.

2. **Machine Translation**: The machine translation states that ""pigs have also found a clay image with very similar points."" This part is incorrect because it attributes the discovery to pigs, which is not mentioned in the source text. The source is about a clay figure, not pigs.

3. **Reference Translation**: The reference translation correctly translates the source to ""A clay figure with very similar features has been found in Ur."" It maintains the context of a clay image and its similarity to something else, without mentioning pigs.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in two main aspects:
- It incorrectly attributes the discovery to pigs, which is not present in the source text.
- It omits the location ""Urvali"" or ""Ur"" from the translation, which is crucial for understanding the context.

To improve the quality of the translation, the machine should be trained to recognize the correct context and avoid adding irrelevant details, such as the mention of pigs. Additionally, it should retain the location information from the source text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: This is why we first identified pachycetus fossil records.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: This is why Pachycetus , which we first identified , disappears from fossil records.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation omits the part ""which we first identified"" and the implied action of disappearance from the fossil records.
- The source text mentions ""අපි මුලින්ම"" (our initial identification), which is not directly translated in the machine translation.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation is missing context about the first identification of Pachycetus and the subsequent disappearance from the records, which is present in the reference translation.
- The source text refers to a specific event (identification) that led to the disappearance, while the machine translation does not convey this connection.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: ""මාසයකට පසු IVවන්"" (A month after that) - Machine translation: ""A month after that""
The machine translation correctly captures the meaning of ""මාසයකට පසු"" (a month later) but omits the reference to ""IV"" in the source.

Step 2: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
Source: ""අමෙන්හොටෙප්"" (Amenhotep) - Machine translation: ""IV's amenhotep""
The machine translation adds ""IV's"" before Amenhotep, which is not present in the source. The reference translation simply uses ""Amenhotep.""

Step 3: Compare the source text with the machine translation for the name change.
Source: ""අක්නාටන්"" (akhnaaton) - Machine translation: ""akhnaaton""
The machine translation accurately translates the name ""අක්නාටන්"" to ""akhnaaton.""

Step 4: Compare the source text with the reference translation for the name change.
Source: ""වෙනස් කොට"" (officially changed) - Machine translation: ""officially changed""
The machine translation correctly translates ""වෙනස් කොට"" to ""officially changed.""

Step 5: Analyze the differences.
The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the inclusion of ""IV's"" before Amenhotep in the machine translation, which is not present in the source text. The rest of the translation is accurate, but the reference translation is clearer and more faithful to the original structure.

Final evaluation: The machine translation is mostly accurate but loses some clarity by adding ""IV's"" which is not in the source. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Sinhala text, making it of higher quality.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

|Source: 1975 දී පීටර් ශෝ විසින් The Character of John Adams නමැති කෘතිය පල කරන ලදී.| Machine translation: In 1975, Peter Shaw published an article named the character of John Adams.| Reference translation: In 1975 , Peter Shaw published The Character of John Adams.| 

Analysis:
1. The source text includes a space after the year ""1975"" in Sinhala, which is not present in the machine translation. This difference is minor and does not affect the meaning.
2. The machine translation uses ""an article named"" while the reference translation uses ""published"", which is a more accurate representation of the action in this context. The reference translation also capitalizes ""The Character of John Adams,"" which is a proper title and should be capitalized.
3. The reference translation includes a space after ""1975"" and before the comma, which is a typographical convention in English but not mentioned in the source text. This is a formatting difference rather than a translation error.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate in conveying the meaning, but it lacks the proper capitalization of the title and a minor formatting difference in punctuation. The main difference lies in the choice of words to describe the action (publishing vs. an article named), which is a stylistic choice rather than a significant error. Overall, the quality of the translation could be improved by addressing these minor issues.

After analyzing the source text, machine translation, and reference translation, the following differences can be observed:

1. **Word order and structure**: The source text is a list of Sinhala words, which are not directly translated into a coherent English sentence structure. The machine translation, on the other hand, presents a repetitive sequence of ""elimination"" in English, which does not convey the intended meaning.

2. **Translation of concepts**: The source text includes a variety of actions and concepts such as ""creation,"" ""revival,"" ""superiority,"" and ""inferiority."" The machine translation only translates a subset of these actions and omits the context, which is crucial for understanding the meaning.

3. **Lack of context**: The machine translation does not provide a clear context or a grammatical structure that would connect these actions together as a list or a concept of being one with all powers.

4. **Omission of key terms**: Terms like ""including"" and ""all the powers"" are missing in the machine translation, which are essential to convey the idea that these actions are part of a broader spectrum.

5. **Repetition**: The machine translation repeats ""elimination"" multiple times, which is not a suitable translation for the source text, as it does not capture the full range of actions.

To improve the quality of the translation, the machine should consider the context and meaning of the source text, and provide a more coherent and accurate translation that reflects the intended message. A more accurate translation would be: ""Being one with all powers, encompassing creation, destruction, revival, superiority, inferiority, and so on.""

|Machine translation: Among the disconnected scientists of this era are important scientists such as portrayal and aryan|
|Reference translation: Among the scholars who lived in this period, scholars like Varahamihira and Aryabhata are important|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""විසූ"" (visu), which likely means ""scholars"" or ""scientists"" in the context of historical figures. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""disconnected scientists,"" which is not a suitable term for referring to historical figures.
2. The source mentions ""වරාහමිහිර"" (Varahamihira) and ""අර්යභට"" (Aryabhata), which are proper names of famous scholars in the field of astronomy. The machine translation mistakenly translates these as ""portrayal"" and ""aryan,"" which are not accurate translations of the names or their context.
3. The reference translation correctly uses ""scholars who lived in this period"" to describe the historical context, while the machine translation does not provide this context.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, context, and proper name translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: It is therefore not suitable for treating alcohol with separate isolated lake only that influenced.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Therefore it is not advisable to treat the affected fish alone in a separate isolation tank.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation seems to have a misunderstanding of the source text, as it mentions ""treating alcohol"" which is not present in the source. The source is about treating ""fish"" (මත්ස්ය) and not alcohol.
- The phrase ""separate isolated lake"" in the machine translation is not accurate, as the reference translation uses ""a separate isolation tank"" which is a more suitable term for the context.
- The reference translation also adds the word ""alone"" (අලුත්) which is not in the source but is necessary to convey the intended meaning that the affected fish should not be treated in isolation without considering other factors.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the subject matter (treating fish vs. alcohol) and the context of the isolation. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Sinhala text, capturing the intended meaning and nuances.

The machine translation provided is not applicable to the source text, as it is a direct translation that does not capture the meaning of the Sinhala sentence. The source text discusses the possibility of something being alive or having freedom, while the machine translation incorrectly interprets it as preventing any species from wind or blockage.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. Read the source text: ""කිසිම ජීවියෙකුටවත් සුළුවෙන් හෝ අවහිරතාවයක් ඇති නොකළ යුතුය"" - This sentence talks about the existence of life or freedom for some entity, not about being obstructed by wind or blockage.

2. Compare with machine translation: ""None of the species should be caused by wind or blockage"" - This translation is unrelated to the source text, as it focuses on the cause rather than the potential for life or freedom.

3. Compare with reference translation: ""No organism should be obstructed in the slightest"" - This translation is closer to the source's meaning, as it conveys the idea of not hindering or obstructing any living thing.

4. Conclusion: The machine translation is not accurate, as it misinterprets the source text. The reference translation better captures the intended meaning of the Sinhala sentence.

Both translations convey the same meaning.

|Source: වායුගෝලය| (atmosphere)
|Machine translation: is displayed as| (is displayed as)
|Reference translation: appears as| (appears as)
The difference here is that ""displayed as"" suggests a more passive or visual representation, while ""appears as"" is a more general term for how something looks or is seen. The reference translation is more accurate in this context, as it refers to the appearance of the atmosphere.

|Source: පටි| (bands)
|Machine translation: several belts| (several belts)
|Reference translation: several bands| (several bands)
Here, ""bands"" is a more common and accurate term for the atmospheric features, especially when referring to the latitudinal divisions.

Overall analysis:
The machine translation captures the general idea but loses some nuance in the choice of words, particularly in describing the appearance of the atmosphere. The reference translation is more precise and faithful to the original Sinhala text, using ""appears as"" and ""bands"" instead of ""displayed as"" and ""belts.""

|Reference translation: Samatha literally means ""to have skill""|

Analysis:
1. The source text states that ""Sinhala-English translation: 'balance' means 'to create skill'"". The machine translation, however, says ""contains talent"" instead of ""to create"" or ""to have"" skill.
2. The reference translation correctly translates the meaning as ""to have skill,"" which is closer to the original intention of the source text, which is to convey the act of developing or acquiring skill through balance.
3. The difference lies in the verb choice: ""to create"" implies a process of formation, while ""to have"" implies possession. The reference translation captures the idea of the skill being present or developed, which is more accurate than the machine translation's suggestion of a passive state.

In conclusion, the machine translation is not entirely accurate as it does not convey the intended meaning of the source text, which is the act of creating or developing skill through balance. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Sinhala meaning.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""hickory proof ritual"" which does not have a direct equivalent in the source text or the reference translation. It seems to be a mistranslation or a literal interpretation that does not convey the intended meaning.
- The reference translation, on the other hand, translates the source as ""the righteous practice disciplined by the Sinhala Buddhist culture,"" which captures the idea of a proper or righteous tradition within the Sinhala Buddhist context.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation misses the concept of ""righteousness"" or ""discipline"" (translated as ""hickory proof"" which is unrelated) in the reference translation.

|Analysis:|
1. **""bben kēmśdaha""** (four verse poem) - The machine translation omits this part, which is crucial to understanding the context as it refers to a specific type of poem.
2. **""sivupādakaviyā""** (poetry of daha siva) - The machine translation uses ""daha siva"" instead of the proper term, which might be a mistranslation or a loss of context.
3. **""uppaya kargannā""** (utilizes) - The machine translation is accurate here.
4. **""kaviyā viśistaratmaka rētīyakīnē""** (in a detailed rule) - The machine translation uses ""in a detailed rule,"" which might be an attempt to convey the idea of a structured approach but loses the specific reference to a ""rule"" or ""method"" (rētīyakīnē).
5. **""buddhatcharitagodannā""** (builds the character of the Buddha) - The machine translation is accurate here.
6. **""ayuru pene""** (intelligence character) - The machine translation translates this as ""intelligence character,"" which is a possible interpretation but not as clear as the reference's ""builds the character of the Buddha.""

In summary, the machine translation loses crucial context by not mentioning the ""four verse poem"" and has a potential mistranslation of ""sivupādakaviyā."" It also omits the specific reference to a rule or method. The translation of the character as ""intelligence"" is less precise than the reference's ""Buddha.""|im_end|

Machine translation: Fish or feeding stops and gulls, may become kittens.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Fish and birds can also stop being healthy and become moldy.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""මාළු"" (fish) as ""Fish or feeding"" which is a redundant and incorrect phrase. It should simply be ""fish.""
- ""පෝෂණය"" (feeding) is not translated accurately, as it is not mentioned in the reference translation. Instead, the reference uses ""healthy.""
- ""ලිහිණියන්"" (gulls) is translated as ""gulls,"" which is correct.
- ""පුස්"" (mold) is not present in the machine translation, while it is a key part of the reference translation to describe the negative outcome.
- ""පත් විය"" (may become) is translated as ""may become kittens,"" which is not relevant to the context and does not match the reference's ""stop being healthy.""

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, clarity, and relevance. It fails to convey the intended meaning of the source text, particularly in the description of the health condition and the outcome.

|Machine translation: It appeared that all of the arms that had been stolen or sunk in the past were removed.
|Reference translation: Everything that had been painted or dipped in it appeared to have been removed in the past.

Analysis:
1. The source text is in Sinhala, discussing objects (probably referring to some kind of containers or vessels) that were either ""�ලේප"" (painted) or ""ගිල්වා"" (dipped) and their past condition.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අතීතයේ"" (in the past) as ""stolen or sunk,"" which is a misinterpretation of the context. The reference translation correctly understands this as referring to the past actions of painting or dipping.
3. The machine translation refers to ""arms"" (which is not present in the source), while the reference translation uses ""Everything"" to encompass the broader meaning of the objects mentioned.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation due to the incorrect interpretation of the past actions and the introduction of a non-related element (arms) in the translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the Sinhala text by focusing on the objects that were painted or dipped and their past removal.

|Machine translation: This disease is caused by protozoan parasites, ammonia and nitrogen exposure, or excessive nitrate.|
|Reference translation: The disease is caused by protozoan parasites and can be caused by exposure to ammonia and nitrite, or high nitrate levels.|

|im_analysis|
1. **protozoan**: Both the machine translation and the reference translation correctly use the term ""protozoan parasites.""
2. **ammonia**: The machine translation uses ""ammonia and nitrogen exposure,"" while the reference translation specifies ""ammonia and nitrite."" The reference is more precise, as nitrite is a specific compound related to ammonia.
3. **nitrogen exposure**: The machine translation combines ""ammonia and nitrogen exposure"" into one phrase, while the reference separates it into ""ammonia"" and ""nitrite exposure."" This distinction is important because nitrite exposure is different from general nitrogen exposure.
4. **excessive nitrate**: The machine translation uses ""excessive nitrate,"" while the reference translation uses ""high nitrate levels."" Both convey the same idea, but ""high nitrate levels"" is more natural in English and provides a clearer context.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its specificity regarding ammonia and nitrite, as well as the way it phrases the nitrate-related aspects. The reference translation is more precise and natural in English, making it of higher quality.

Source: ඉහත ගිවිසුමෙන් ඔවුනට ස්වයං පාලනය සඳහා පුළුල් ප්‍රශෂාවක් ලැබුනි.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the source text
Machine translation: They received wide powers for automatic control over the previous agreement.
Source text: They received powers for self-government in relation to the above agreement.

Step 3: Identify differences
- Machine translation: ""wide powers for automatic control"" vs ""powers for self-government""
- Machine translation: ""previous agreement"" vs ""above agreement""

Step 4: Analyze the differences
- ""Automatic control"" is not present in the source text, which instead refers to ""self-government.""
- ""Previous"" is translated as ""above"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate. The source text uses ""අහිත"" (above) to indicate the agreement that has already been mentioned, but it does not mean ""previous"" in the chronological sense.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality
The machine translation has some inaccuracies, particularly in the interpretation of ""self-government"" and the use of ""above"" instead of ""previous."" The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text.

Step 1: Identify key terms and phrases in the source text
- ""කර්ණශංඛ"" (cochlea)
- ""බද්ධය"" (implant)
- ""මගින්"" (by)
- ""෇සුණු"" (transmitted)
- ""ශබ්දය"" (sound)
- ""ස්නායු"" (neural)
- ""සංඥාවක්"" (signal)
- ""ලෙස"" (as)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""The sound heard by the kernel transplant is derived from the kernel as a neural signal.""
- Reference translation: ""The sound heard by the cochlear implant is transmitted from the cochlea as a neural signal.""

Differences:
1. ""kernel transplant"" vs ""cochlear implant"": The machine translation uses ""kernel transplant"" which is incorrect, as it refers to a part of a computer system, not a medical device for hearing. The correct term is ""cochlear implant"" which refers to the device for the deaf.
2. ""sound"" is translated as ""heard"" in the machine translation, but the reference translation uses ""transmitted"" to convey the action of the sound being sent to the implant.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation is of lower quality due to the incorrect use of ""kernel transplant"" instead of ""cochlear implant"" and the lack of clarity in expressing the transmission of sound. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text, focusing on the cochlea and the neural signal involved in the hearing process.

|Reference translation: Here she represented the role of a hip hop dance teacher.| (English, same as machine translation)

Analysis:
1. The source text in Sinhala is discussing the representation of a character, specifically a ""hip hop dance teacher.""
2. The machine translation accurately captures the meaning, translating ""hip් ෷ොප්"" as ""hip hop"" and ""ගුරුවරියක"" as ""dance teacher.""
3. The reference translation is identical to the machine translation, indicating that there are no differences in meaning or structure.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is of high quality and aligns closely with the reference translation. The differences between the two are minimal and do not affect the overall meaning. The only potential issue could be the slight loss of nuance in the Sinhala-to-English conversion, but the core information is accurately conveyed.

|Machine translation: Meanwhile, Firefly is elected president of the Asian CEO organization.
|Reference translation: Meanwhile, the Southeast Asian CEO is elected chairman of the organization.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""අග්නිදිගාසියානු CEO"" which refers to the CEO of a specific region, likely Southeast Asia, as ""අග්නිදිග"" is a colloquial term for Southeast Asia in Sinhala.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අග්නිදිගාසියානු"" as ""Asian"" and omits the regional context, resulting in ""Asian CEO organization"" instead of ""Southeast Asian CEO.""
3. The reference translation correctly identifies the CEO as from Southeast Asia and uses the term ""chairman"" (which is more appropriate for an organization's leader, especially in the context of a non-American organization), while the machine translation uses ""president.""

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in two main aspects: it lacks the regional specificity of the CEO and incorrectly translates the position as ""president"" instead of ""chairman.""

|Machine translation: And he encouraged the construction of a number of tombs for the noblemen.
|Reference translation: He also encouraged the construction of a number of tombs for the aristocracy.
|Analysis:|
1. The source text refers to ""එසේම වංශවතුන්"" which translates to ""aristocracy"" in the reference translation. The machine translation uses ""noblemen"" which is a more specific term and may not capture the full meaning of the aristocracy in the Sinhala context.
2. The verb ""අනුබල"" in the source text means ""encouraged"" or ""promoted"" in English. The machine translation accurately conveys this action.
3. The phrase ""ගණනාවක්"" in the source text refers to ""the construction"" or ""building"" of tombs. The machine translation correctly translates this.

Overall, the main difference lies in the choice of the term ""aristocracy"" instead of ""noblemen,"" which may lead to a less precise translation in the context of the broader social class in Sinhala culture. The action and the core meaning of the sentence are preserved in the machine translation, but the choice of words could be improved for a more accurate representation.

|Source: sinhala| Machine translation: Over the centuries many prominent officials from that forefront and Confucian theologians were raised.| Reference translation: Over the centuries the same lineage produced many high officials and Confucian scholars.|
|Translation analysis:|
1. **""සියවස්"" (centuries)**: Both translations capture the concept of ""over the centuries,"" but the machine translation uses ""prominent officials from that forefront"" instead of ""the same lineage.""
2. **""ගණනාවක්"" (produced)**: The machine translation uses ""raised"" which implies upbringing or development, while the reference translation uses ""produced,"" which is more appropriate for referring to the lineage's output.
3. **""පුරා"" (from)**: The machine translation omits this word, which is crucial for specifying the origin of the officials and scholars.
4. **""වංශයෙන්"" (lineage)**: The machine translation does not directly translate this term, using ""frontier"" instead, which is not accurate in this context.
5. **""බොහෝ"" (many)**: Both translations convey the idea of multiple individuals, but the machine translation does not specify the type of individuals (officials and scholars).
6. **""අවස්සා"" (officials)**: The machine translation uses ""prominent officials"" which is a broader term, while the reference translation specifies ""high officials,"" which is more precise.
7. **""Confucian theologians""**: The machine translation translates this as ""Confucian theologians,"" which is a direct translation, but the reference translation omits this part, likely assuming the readers would understand the context.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specifying the lineage, using ""frontier"" instead of ""lineage,"" and including ""Confucian theologians"" which is not present in the reference. The reference translation is more precise and faithful to the source text.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text is in Sinhala, discussing a monk (Venerable Monk) understanding a Buddha's idea.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අදහස"" (idea) as ""my lady"" and repeats it multiple times, which is not a suitable translation for the context.

4. The machine translation also adds ""Eleanor"" which is not present in the source text, indicating a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation.

In conclusion, the machine translation is significantly different from the reference translation due to the incorrect interpretation of the idea and the addition of an unrelated name. The machine translation should be revised to convey the monk's action and the idea being understood, as in the reference translation.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: • The rights of individuals not interrupted by the rights of individuals

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Enjoy rights without interfering with the rights of others

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation seems to have a literal interpretation of the source text, which results in a less natural and slightly awkward phrasing in English.
- The source text mentions ""අන්-අයගේ"" (not by the rights of others) and ""අයිතිවාසිකම්"" (individual rights), which are not directly translated into ""interrupted by"" and ""the rights of individuals"" respectively.
- The reference translation conveys the idea of ""not interfering"" and ""enjoying rights"" more clearly, which is closer to the original meaning.

Step 5: Identify differences
- The machine translation misses the nuance of ""not being disturbed"" or ""not interfering"" in the source text.
- The reference translation uses the phrase ""without interfering with"" to better capture the idea of mutual respect for rights.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of conveying the idea of mutual respect for individual rights without interruption, and it lacks the nuance of the original Sinhala text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: So when young, the kids were taught to read.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: So children were taught to read at an early age.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The source text uses ""කුඩා"" (kuda), which refers to ""young"" or ""infant"" in Sinhala, while the machine translation uses ""when young"" which is a more general phrase. The reference translation captures this by saying ""at an early age.""
- The source text uses ""අමයින්"" (amayini), which is a more colloquial way of referring to ""we"" or ""us"" in this context, but the machine translation omits this, making it sound like a third-person statement. The reference translation does not have this issue.
- The source text uses ""පිණිස"" (pinnis), which is a verb form indicating the act of acquiring or learning, while the machine translation uses ""taught to read,"" which is a more direct translation but loses the sense of the process. The reference translation captures this by saying ""were taught.""

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity (using ""kuda"" instead of ""when young""), colloquialism (""අමයින්"" vs. no equivalent), and the nuance of the learning process (""pinnis"" vs. ""taught to read"").

3. The source text uses ""වැටුණු"" (vatuṇu), which means ""fell out"" or ""got stuck"". The machine translation captures this action as ""fell out of"".
4. The source text has ""ජනෙල්වලින්"" (janewalini), which refers to ""in the windows"" or ""inside the windows"". The machine translation correctly translates this as ""out of the windows"".
5. The source text uses ""පිටතට"" (pitattada), which implies ""stuck"" or ""trapped"". The machine translation does not directly translate this, but the context suggests a similar meaning.

Overall, the machine translation captures the main idea of the source text but loses some details about the people's condition and the specific term for ""stuck"". The reference translation is more precise and faithful to the original Sinhala text.

|Reference translation: These can often involve low levels of fish, but acute infections do not occur unless they are affected by factors such as poor pools or poor diet.|

Analysis:
1. The source text discusses ""මාළු"" (low levels) in the context of fish, but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""fish"" without specifying the low levels.
2. The machine translation incorrectly assumes that ""melanoma"" is a factor affecting the uterus, which is not mentioned in the source text. The reference translation correctly omits this connection.
3. The machine translation incorrectly states that the uterus is ""not infected,"" while the reference translation correctly implies that acute infections are prevented if not influenced by certain factors.
4. The machine translation uses ""affected by"" in a way that suggests a cause-and-effect relationship with melanoma, which is not clear from the source text. The reference translation uses ""affected by"" in a more general sense, referring to factors like poor pools or diet.

In summary, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""මාළු"" (low levels), the connection to melanoma, and the description of infection prevention. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Sinhala text.

|Source: පෙර තම පූර්වජයන් ආහාරයට ගත් විලෝපිකයන්|
|Machine translation: The predators that had previously eaten their prey are now considered to be the food of Basilosaurs|
|Reference translation: Predators that previously ate their ancestors have now become the food of bacillosores|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""පෙර තම"" (previous ones), which likely refers to the predators in the context of a food chain or a historical sequence. In the machine translation, this is translated as ""previously eaten their prey,"" which is a direct translation but loses the ancestral connection.
2. ""පූර්වජයන්"" (ancestors) is not directly translated in the machine translation, as it is replaced with ""their prey,"" which is a more general term and does not convey the familial relationship.
3. ""විලෝපිකයන්"" (predators) is correctly translated.
4. ""බැසිලෝසෝරයන්"" (Basilosaurs) is a specific term that appears in the machine translation, but the reference translation uses ""bacillosores,"" which is likely a typographical error or a different term, as Basilosaurs are not the same as bacillosores.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- It does not capture the ancestral relationship between the predators and their ""prey"" (translated as ""ancestors"" in the reference).
- It uses ""Basilosaurs"" as the target of consumption, which is incorrect or at least not the term used in the reference.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should reflect the ancestral connection and use the correct term for the target of consumption, if ""bacillosores"" is the intended reference.

|Reference translation: Antisemitism emerged in the Middle Ages, in the form of persecution, genocide, coercion, expulsion, social restrictions, and ghettoization.|

Analysis:
1. The source text lists several actions and concepts related to antisemitism, such as ""පීඩා"" (persecution), ""සංහාර"" (genocide), ""බල කිරීම්"" (coercion), ""නෙරපා හැරීම්"" (expulsion), ""සමාංග සීමාවන්"" (social restrictions), and ""ghettoization"" in the context of the ""මැද යුගය"" (Middle Ages).
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""පීඩා"" as ""suffered from digestion"" and ""සංහාර"" as ""insanity"" and ""neoplatonism,"" which are not accurate translations of the original concepts. It also combines ""ගොල්කිරීම්"" (coercion) and ""නෙරපා"" (expulsion) into a single phrase, losing the distinction.
3. The machine translation omits the term ""සමාංග සීමාවන්"" (social restrictions), which is present in the source text and the reference translation.
4. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of the source text by listing the actions and concepts in the context of the Middle Ages and using the appropriate English terms for them.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of accuracy and the representation of the original concepts. It incorrectly translates key terms and omits important details from the source text.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""දේව"" (goddess), which is translated correctly in the machine translation as ""the goddess of the church."" However, the reference translation uses ""ministry"" instead, which is more accurate in the context of a religious institution's role in healing.
2. The machine translation incorrectly uses ""psychological healing"" instead of ""mental healing"" in the second part. The reference translation uses ""mental"" which is more precise, as it refers to the emotional or psychological state of a person, rather than a broader term like ""psychological.""

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the specific reference to the ""ministry"" and the use of ""mental healing"" instead of ""psychological healing."" The reference translation is more accurate and contextually appropriate.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The Underground Gava is traumatized by the trauma caused by the ale and the endosa in the cursor.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""අණ්ඩාකාර"" (ale), ""ගවාක්ෂය"" (gavaksha, likely referring to the oval window), ""අන්තෝවසා"" (anathovasa, vestibule), and ""කර්ණශංඛය"" (karunshangha, cochlea).
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""ගවාක්ෂය"" as "" Underground Gava"" and ""අලින්දය"" and ""කර්ණශංඛය"" as ""ale"" and ""endosa"" respectively, which are not accurate. It also mentions ""cursor"" which is not present in the source text.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation accurately translates the concepts from the source text, using the correct terms for the oval window, vestibule, and cochlea.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy and context. It incorrectly identifies the oval window, confuses ""අලින්දය"" and ""කර්ණශංඛය"" with unrelated terms, and introduces a non-existent term ""cursor."" The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a clear and accurate translation of the source text.

|Reference translation: Important town reconstructions were interrupted by the blockade and the Horsemen did not give a place of government significantly within the Senate. |

Analysis:
1. The source text is in Sinhala, and the machine translation accurately captures the meaning, including the key phrases ""වැදගත් නඟර"" (important town reconstructions), ""අවහිර බාධා"" (blockade), and "" Horsemen"" (which is a reference to a historical context or group, possibly ""අසරුවන්"").
2. The machine translation maintains the structure and the core message of the reference translation, which is that the reconstructions were interrupted and the Horsemen's involvement did not result in a significant presence of government within the Senate.
3. The only difference between the machine and reference translations is the absence of the word ""නොදීමෙන්"" (not) in the machine translation. This word is not essential to the meaning, as the reference translation conveys the same idea without it.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the use of the word ""nodīmen"" which is not necessary for the overall meaning. The core message and structure are consistent with the reference translation.

|Machine translation: Shiite fighting rooms under al sadr captured several towns in southern Iraq|
|Reference translation: Under al-Sadr, Shiite militants captured several cities in southern Iraq|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""අල් සදර්"" (al sadar), which is a proper noun referring to a specific person or group. In the machine translation, it is translated as ""al sadr"" without the honorific ""අල්"" (under), which is a crucial context difference.
2. The source uses ""්යටතේ"" (under) to indicate the location, which is not directly translated in the machine translation, leading to a less clear reference to the context.
3. The source mentions ""ශයිට්"" (fighters) or ""කාමීහු"" (militants), which is translated as ""fighting rooms"" in the machine translation. This is a misinterpretation, as ""කාමීහු"" typically refers to fighters, not rooms specifically for fighting.
4. The source uses ""නගර"" (towns) and ""කීපයක්"" (capture), while the machine translation uses ""several towns"" and omits ""කීපයක්"" (capture), which is a loss of detail.
5. The reference translation correctly uses ""cities"" instead of ""towns"" to match the more common term in the source, and it adds the honorific ""al-Sadr"" to the name, which is more accurate.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of context, specific terminology, and the level of detail. The machine translation loses some important nuances and makes some errors in interpretation, leading to a less accurate translation.|im_end|

|Machine translation: The basic model of the season was developed in such a rough form as Holland North's idea.|
|Reference translation: Holland North is of the opinion that the basic model of the period developed in such an approximate form.|

Analysis:
1. The source text uses ""මූලික"" (basic) to describe the model, while the machine translation uses ""season"" instead of ""period"" or ""මුලික"" (which is not directly translated). This difference affects the meaning, as it refers to the model's development in a specific time frame rather than its nature.
2. The machine translation uses ""rough form"" (අදහසයි) which is a direct translation of ""දළ"" (rough), but the reference translation uses ""approximate form"" (අන්තර්ගත) which conveys a similar idea but with a more nuanced meaning, suggesting a less precise or rough version.
3. The phrase ""වූ"" (was developed) is translated correctly in both, but the structure is slightly different in the machine translation, which makes it sound like the idea is attributed to the rough form, while the reference translation clarifies that it's the opinion of Holland North.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific time frame (season vs. period), the choice of words to describe the model's form (rough vs. approximate), and the structure, which affects the clarity of the idea that the basic model was developed in a certain way according to Holland North's opinion.

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""බැක්ටීරියා"" (bacteria) and ""අකීයා"" (acacia), which are two separate entities. The machine translation combines them into ""akia,"" which is incorrect. The reference translation correctly separates them as ""bacteria"" and ""acacia.""
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""මෙන් 15 ගුණයක්"" (15 times) as ""15 times the virus,"" suggesting that the virus is contained within the bacteria and acacia. However, the source text implies that the ocean has 15 times more viruses compared to the bacteria and acacia combined.
3. The structure of the sentence is also different in the machine translation. The reference translation uses ""contains 15 times as many viruses as"" to convey the ratio, which is clearer and more accurate than the machine's attempt.

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""මහලු"" (mahlu), which is a colloquial term for ""sugar"" in Sinhala. The machine translation does not capture this term, using ""the sugar consumption"" instead, which is a more formal and direct translation.
2. The source mentions ""සීනි"" (sini), which refers to the ""yellow mole"" or ""yellow spot"" in the eye. The machine translation translates this as ""the yellow mole of the eye,"" which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""the destruction of the yellow spot.""
3. The source text implies a connection between sugar consumption and the process of ""විනාශ"" (vinashaya), which means ""destruction"" or ""disappearance"" in Sinhala. The machine translation simply states ""connection,"" which does not convey the destructive aspect.

In summary, the machine translation loses the colloquial term for sugar, does not accurately translate the term for the yellow spot, and does not convey the destructive nature of the connection. The reference translation provides a more nuanced and accurate representation of the source text.

Machine translation: He continued to find more oil wells, so.

Step 3: Read the reference translation

- The machine translation omits the phrase ""අබැවිනි"" which is a colloquial way of saying ""that's why"" or ""for this reason"" in Sinhala. This is important to convey the cause-effect relationship in the sentence.
- The machine translation also does not capture the nuance of the phrase ""දිගින් දිගටම"" which means ""more and more"" in Sinhala, making it sound like a simple repetition of ""more"" in English.
- The reference translation uses ""kept trying"" to express the continuous action, while the machine translation uses ""continued to find"" which is a similar but less idiomatic expression.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the missing causal phrase and the nuance of the phrase ""දිගින් දිගටම,"" which affects the meaning and readability of the sentence.

|Reference translation:| After the past, Korea was renamed and the capital was moved back to modern Seoul.|

|Analysis:|
1. The source text mentions ""අගනගරය"" (agannagaraya), which refers to the capital city. In the machine translation, it is translated as ""modern Saul,"" which is incorrect. The correct reference translation uses ""modern Seoul,"" which is the capital of South Korea.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: ""එය ශාට්ස් ෷භාව වෙනුවෙන් යාච්ඤා recites විට, ඔහු අතරමැදියෙකු ලෙස නොව, පහසුකම් සපයන්නා ලෙස කටයුතු කර නැත.""
Machine translation: ""When it was prayer recites for the council of Saints, not as he was a midwife, the facilities were not conducted.""

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- The source text uses ""යාච්ඤා"" (recites) while the machine translation uses ""prayer recites"" which is not grammatically correct in this context.
- The source text refers to ""සභාව"" (Church of Shats) while the machine translation omits this specific reference.
- The source text uses ""අතරමැදියෙකු"" (midwife) and ""පහසුකම්"" (facilities) which are translated differently in the machine translation.
- The source text uses ""කටයුතු"" (act) and ""නැත"" (did not) which are translated correctly, but the structure is slightly different in the machine translation.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: ""When it recites prayers for the Church of Shats, he did not act as a facilitator, but as an not intermediary.""

Step 4: Analyze the differences between the machine and reference translations.
- The reference translation correctly uses ""prayers"" instead of ""prayer recites.""
- The reference translation keeps the reference to ""සභාව"" (Church of Shats).
- The reference translation uses ""facilitator"" instead of ""facilities"" and ""intermediary"" instead of ""not intermediary"" which is a more accurate and natural phrasing.

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences in terms of grammar, specific reference, and phrasing compared to the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

- The machine translation omits the name ""විජිත"" (Victor) and instead translates it as ""subdivisions"" which is not present in the source text. This is a significant difference as it changes the meaning of the sentence.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""විජිත සභාව"" as ""colonies controlled"" instead of ""which had ruled the colonies.""
- The reference translation correctly identifies the subject as ""the colonial council"" and adds the necessary context that it had ruled from the beginning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the omitted name, incorrect interpretation of ""විජිත සභාව,"" and the structure of the sentence. The reference translation provides a more accurate representation of the source text's meaning.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

The machine translation has some differences from the reference translation:

1. The word ""විධි"" is missing in the machine translation, which is crucial for understanding the context.
2. ""අතර"" is translated as ""this"" in the machine translation, while it should be translated as ""which"" to connect the cause and effect.
3. ""නිකායෙන්"" is translated as ""due to"" in the machine translation, but it should be translated as ""caused by"" to indicate the cause of unrest.
4. ""බැහැර"" is translated as ""disagreement"" in the machine translation, but it should be translated as ""unrest"" to match the reference.
5. ""පිරිස්වල"" is translated as ""out of nica"" in the machine translation, which is not clear. The reference translation indicates that it refers to people outside the sect.
6. ""නොසන්සුන්තාවය"" is not translated accurately in the machine translation, it should be translated as ""unrest"" to convey the same meaning.

Overall, the machine translation has some significant errors in terms of vocabulary, grammar, and context, which affect the quality of the translation.

|Source: ශුද්ධ වු අල් කුර් ආන් පරිවර්තනය|
|Machine translation: Performing Holy Al Khur Aan|
|Reference translation: Translating the Holy Qur 'an|
**Difference**: The machine translation refers to ""Performing"" while the reference translation uses ""Translating"". The source text is about the process of translating, not performing a specific ritual.

|Source: එක්සත්‍යාපුරාවිකයින්|
|Machine translation: all times|
|Reference translation: across time|
**Difference**: The machine translation uses ""all times"" which is a literal translation of ""සෑම අවස්ථාවක"", but the reference translation conveys the idea of ""across time"" more accurately, which implies the continuous nature of the task throughout history.

|Source: සෑම|
|Machine translation: problematic and embarrassing|
|Reference translation: problematic and difficult|
**Difference**: The machine translation combines ""problematic"" and ""embarrassing"" while the reference translation uses ""problematic"" and ""difficult"" separately. The source text does not mention embarrassment, only the difficulty of the task.

|Source: ප්‍රශ්නයක්|
|Machine translation: task|
|Reference translation: task|
**Difference**: Both translations are accurate for ""අවස්ථාවක්"" which means ""question"" or ""task"" in this context. However, the reference translation keeps it as ""task"" which is more suitable.

|im_end|>

In summary, the machine translation has differences in terms of verb choice (performing vs. translating), the addition of ""embarrassing"" which is not in the source, and the use of ""across time"" instead of ""all times"" for a more accurate historical context. The translation is not entirely incorrect, but it could be improved by focusing on the core meaning and context of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: එය කෙතරම් දරුණුවුවාද කියතොත් මහනුවර රජතුමාටද මෙය මහත් ගැටලුවක් විය.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: If it's so harsh, the Metropolitan King, this was a fatal problem.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: It was so bad that it was a big problem for the King of Kandy too.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""මහනුවර"" (Metropolitan), which is not translated accurately as ""Metropolitan King"" in the machine translation. It should be translated as ""Kandy"" since it refers to the King of Kandy.
- The machine translation uses ""fatal problem"" which is a stronger and more severe term than the reference translation's ""big problem.""
- The source text does not specify that the problem was for the King of Kandy, but it can be inferred from the context. The machine translation does not make this inference.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation captures the meaning that the situation was very bad and posed a significant issue for the King of Kandy, which aligns better with the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, specifically in identifying the King as the King of Kandy and the severity of the problem. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Sinhala text.

|Machine translation: This rebel species was often given the product in Western European countries.
|Reference translation: This type of rebellion was mostly produced in Western European countries.

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to a ""මෙම කැරලි වර්ගය"" (this rebel species) receiving something, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""the product"" (which is not specified in the source).
2. The source uses ""නිෂ්පත්තිය"" (loss or decline), which is not directly translated into ""given"" in the machine translation, but rather implies a context of decline or production in the reference translation.
3. The machine translation states ""was often given"" which suggests a passive action, whereas the reference translation uses ""was mostly produced"" which indicates a more active process.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the action (production vs. giving) and the focus on the process rather than the passive receipt of something. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text, emphasizing the production of the rebellion in Western European countries.

**Difference 1**: The machine translation omits the word ""අයිස්කරීඅඩුම්"" (ice cream) from the source, which is crucial for understanding the context.

|Source:| අයිස්කරීඅඩුම් පෙන්නුම්|

|Machine translation:| by December it is very large|
|Reference translation:| by the end of April and December

In summary, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of missing key information, incorrect interpretation of words, and incorrect sentence structure, leading to a less accurate representation of the source text.

Machine translation: Then the salad plant is mutilated and the head part grows weak.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: That is, the lettuce is deformed and the growth of the head is impaired.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""salad plant"" while the reference translation specifies ""lettuce,"" which is more accurate.
- The machine translation uses ""mutilated"" which implies a violent act, while the reference translation uses ""deformed,"" which is a more neutral term for plant growth issues.
- The machine translation says ""the head part grows weak,"" while the reference translation says ""the growth of the head is impaired,"" which is a more precise description of the issue.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The source text refers to ""සලාද්‍රව්‍ය"" (salad), not ""salad plant,"" which is a more specific term.
- The machine translation's ""mutilated"" is not the most suitable term for the context, as it implies a more severe action than ""deformed.""
- The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text by using ""impaired"" to describe the growth issue.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: A tooth can have several teeth roots or a single root.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""a few or a single root or a single root,"" which suggests that a tooth can have multiple options for roots, including a few, a single, or another single root.
- The reference translation, on the other hand, says ""several teeth roots or a single root,"" which implies that a tooth can have multiple roots (plural) or just one.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The main difference is the use of ""a few"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference translation. The reference uses ""several"" to indicate multiple roots, which is a more accurate translation of the Sinhala source.
- The machine translation omits the plural form of ""root"" (teeth roots) in the second part, which is crucial for clarity.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation because it incorrectly translates ""දත්"" (plural) as ""a few"" and omits the plural form ""teeth roots."" The reference translation better captures the meaning of the original Sinhala text.

|Reference translation: Allah provided shade from the thick clouds as the Israelites walked through this burning desert|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""පුළුස්සා දවාලන්න්"" (burning desert), which is not directly translated in the machine translation as ""wide daylight"". The reference translation correctly captures the idea of a scorching desert.
2. The machine translation incorrectly states that the Israelis ""planned to give shade of Allah with thick clouds"", suggesting an active action on their part. The reference translation, on the other hand, implies that Allah provided the shade, which is a passive action.
3. The reference translation uses ""walked through"" to describe the Israelites' movement, which is not present in the machine translation.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""බමුණෝද"" (Brahmins), not ""මුස්奎"" (mosque), which is a significant difference.
2. The source uses ""මදුවේ"" (in Madhu), while the machine translation incorrectly assumes it refers to a country, translating it as ""the country of Madhu.""

|Machine translation: The removal of bhagavati and labia minora is a name used for removal entirely or partly.
|Reference translation: A name used to remove the aorta and remove the labia minora completely or partially.

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""kbhagamaniy ivath kiriym"" (kbhagavati removal) and ""labia minora"" (labia minora removal), which are medical terms in Sinhala.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""kbhagamaniy"" as ""bhagavati,"" which is a reference to a deity in Hinduism, not a medical term related to the procedure. The correct term should be ""kbhagamaniy ivath"" (aorta removal).
3. The machine translation omits the second part of the source, ""labia minora"" and its context, which is also a medical term. It translates it as ""labia minora"" without specifying the removal.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways:
- It incorrectly translates ""kbhagamaniy"" as ""bhagavati"" instead of ""kbhagamaniy ivath.""
- It omits the term ""labia minora"" and its context, which is crucial for understanding the context of the removal.
- The reference translation specifies ""aorta"" instead of ""bhagavati,"" which is a more accurate medical term.

To improve the translation, the machine should recognize ""kbhagamaniy"" as a medical term and translate it as ""aorta,"" and include ""labia minora"" with its context. The correct translation would be: ""A name used for aorta removal and partial or complete removal of labia minora.""|im_end|

|Source: විවිධ උප විශේෂයන් |
|Machine translation: Various subspecies |
|Reference translation: Different subspecies |

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the choice of words. The source text refers to ""විවිධ උප විශේෂයන්"" which means ""various subspecies"" in Sinhala, but the machine translation omits the context of ""tablet"" or ""fruits and thorns"" that the reference translation provides. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""වල"" (wala) as ""tablets"" or ""bones,"" which is not the intended meaning in this context.

|Source: ඒවායේ ප්වල්වල් |
|Machine translation: rather than by the differences in the shape of the tablets |
|Reference translation: in the shape of their fruits and thorns |

The machine translation again misunderstands the term ""වල"" and translates it as ""tablets,"" which is not accurate. The correct interpretation would be related to the physical characteristics of the fruits or thorns, as indicated in the reference translation.

|Source: හැඩයේ |
|Machine translation: rather than by the differences in the shape of the bones |
|Reference translation: vary slightly |

The machine translation incorrectly translates ""හැඩයේ"" (haddaye) as ""the differences in the shape of the bones,"" which is not the intended meaning. The correct translation should convey the idea of variation or change, as in ""vary slightly.""

|Source: වෙනස්කම් |
|Machine translation: rather than by the differences |
|Reference translation: in the shape |

The machine translation omits the word ""කටු"" (katu) and its context, which refers to the thorns in the source text. The reference translation correctly includes ""in the shape"" to describe the variation.

In summary, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of context and word choice, particularly in the interpretation of ""වල"" and ""හැඩයේ."" The correct translation should convey the variation in the shape of fruits and thorns, not tablets or bones.

|Source: මේ නිසා භාණ්ඩවලින් ගුණත්වය පිළිබඳව වඩා වැඩි සැළකිල්ලක් ලබා දෙයි|
|Machine translation: This makes it more concerned about the quality of the items|
|Reference translation: This gives more attention to the quality of the goods|

Analysis:
1. The source text uses ""නිසා"" (nisā), which refers to a specific context or situation, while the machine translation omits this context, making it less precise.
2. The source text uses ""බාණ්ඩ"" (bāṇḍa), which refers to a market or store, but the machine translation does not translate this term, leading to a loss of context.
3. The phrase ""ගුණත්වය"" (gūnatvaya) means ""quality"" in Sinhala, which is accurately translated as ""the quality"" in both the machine and reference translations.
4. The machine translation uses ""concerned about"" instead of ""attention to"" in the reference translation. While both phrases convey a similar idea, ""attention to"" is a more direct and natural translation of ""අත්තුරු"" (atturu) in this context.

Overall, the machine translation loses some context and nuance by not translating ""nisā"" and ""bāṇḍa,"" and it uses a slightly different phrasing for the focus on quality. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the meaning and tone of the source text.

|Machine translation: The controversies about the 1876 presidential election were compromised by the 1877 election.|
|Reference translation: The 1877 Reconciliation Agreement was used to settle disputes over the 1876 presidential election.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""මතභේදයන්"" (controversies) and ""සමථයකට පත් කිරීම"" (informing about the agreement), which are not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it uses ""compromised"" which implies a negative resolution, while the reference translation correctly refers to a ""Reconciliation Agreement"" for resolving disputes.
2. The machine translation omits the specific purpose of the 1877 event, which is to ""settle disputes"" in the reference translation.
3. The structure of the sentence is slightly different, with the machine translation placing ""by the 1877 election"" at the end, while the reference translation separates it more clearly with ""was used to settle disputes over the 1876 presidential election"".

Overall, the machine translation loses some context and nuance, focusing on the compromise aspect rather than the specific agreement for resolving the disputes. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

|Machine translation: It was here that the accommodation hall at Eaton was founded by several continuous brickworks.|
|Reference translation: This is because of the fact that several bricks containing the text Ankheperure have been found here in the celebration hall in Atten.|

Analysis:
1. The source text is discussing the discovery of bricks with a specific text (Ankheperure) in the celebration hall at Atten (not Eaton).
2. The machine translation incorrectly assumes that the accommodation hall at Eaton was founded by continuous brickworks, which is not the main point of the source text.
3. The reference translation correctly captures the connection between the bricks containing the text and the celebration hall in Atten.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation by misinterpreting the context and focusing on the wrong aspect (foundations vs. discovery of bricks with a specific text). The reference translation accurately reflects the meaning of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: මේ නිසා 1886දී මෙය ""නිල වශයෙන්"" ලිහා විවෘත කරන්නේ මැස්පරෝ විසිනි.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: So in 1886 this was ""officially"" Liha opened by masparo.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: As a result, it was ""officially"" opened in 1886 by Masparro.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""opened"" without a specific time marker (like ""in 1886""), while the reference translation includes it.
- The machine translation has ""Liha opened"" without quotation marks, while the reference translation has them, indicating a direct quote.
- The machine translation has ""by masparo"" without a possessive marker, while the reference translation uses ""by Masparro"" with proper capitalization.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
1. The time frame is missing in the machine translation, which is ""in 1886"" in the reference.
2. The quotation marks around ""නිල වශයෙන්"" are missing in the machine translation, which is important for the context.
3. The proper noun ""Masparro"" is not capitalized in the machine translation, which is a grammatical error in the reference.

To improve the quality of the machine translation, these differences should be addressed.

|im_start|
After analyzing the source text, machine translation, and reference translation, I can identify the following differences:

1. **Sinhala to English Vocabulary**: The source text uses the Sinhala term ""හෘදයේ"" (heart's) which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation uses ""the upper part of the heart,"" which is a direct equivalent.

2. **Sinhala to English Grammar**: The phrase ""විශාල රුධිර"" (large blood vessels) is translated as ""several large blood vessels"" in both the machine and reference translations. However, the word order is slightly different in the machine translation, which places ""several"" before ""large blood vessels"" while the reference translation places it after.

3. **Sentence structure**: The source text includes the phrase ""වාහිනී කිහිපයකම"" (related to the connection), which is not explicitly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation omits this part, as it is implied by the context that the upper part of the heart is the connection point.

4. **Punctuation**: The source text does not have any punctuation, while the reference translation includes a period at the end. This is a minor difference but necessary for proper sentence structure in English.

In summary, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of vocabulary, word order, and the inclusion of a phrase that is not directly translated. The main difference is the absence of the phrase ""related to the connection"" in the machine translation, which slightly alters the meaning. The reference translation is a more direct and accurate translation of the source text.

|Machine translation:| There is once a mention of the archimedes using a large mirror group that came to attack Syracuse and burned the Roman ships.|
|Reference translation:| Archimedes once set fire to the Roman ships that came to attack Syracuse using a large group of mirrors.|

|Analysis:|
1. **Subject and verb**: The source sentence starts with ""වරක් ආකිමිඩීස්"" (Archimedes) as the subject, while the machine translation incorrectly omits this and starts with ""There is once a mention of"". The reference translation correctly includes the subject.
2. **Action**: The source uses ""අවිස්සාවේ"" (using) to describe the action, which is translated to ""using a large mirror group"" in the machine translation. The reference translation also captures this action accurately.
3. **Purpose**: The source mentions the purpose of the action, ""අමතකාගින්"" (to attack) and ""අවිස්සාවේ"" (using) together, which is translated as ""that came to attack"" in the machine translation. The reference translation conveys the same meaning.
4. **Result**: The source states ""පහර දීම"" (to burn) and ""අවිස්සාවේ"" (using) to describe the outcome, which is translated as ""burned the Roman ships"" in the machine translation. The reference translation is consistent with this.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following aspects:

1. **Word choice**: The source text uses ""විවිධ කාණ්ඩ"" which refers to ""various incidents"" or ""various types of flights"" in a broader context, while the machine translation translates it as ""crew flights,"" which is more specific to flights involving a crew. The reference translation captures the broader meaning by using ""different categories of flying.""

2. **Grammar**: The source text does not explicitly mention ""acquired"" or ""evolution"" as in the machine translation. Instead, it implies the evolution process through the phrase ""අත්පත් කරගත්"" which means ""have come about"" or ""have developed."" The reference translation captures this by saying ""how they acquired during their evolution.""

3. **Sentence structure**: The machine translation combines the ideas of ""acquired"" and ""evolutionary or wonderful stories"" into one sentence, while the reference translation separates them, making the meaning clearer.

In summary, the machine translation is less accurate in capturing the full meaning of the source text, focusing on crew flights and a more specific evolutionary context, whereas the reference translation provides a more nuanced and accurate representation of the original Sinhala text.

The source text is in Sinhala and says, ""යනුවෙන් සද්ධර්ම රත්නාවලිය යන්නෙහි අරුත දැක්විය හැකිය,"" which translates to ""It can be said that it refers to Saddharma Ratnavaliya.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
Machine translation: ""The Summer warmth can be fabricated.""
Reference translation: ""can mean Saddharma Ratnavaliya.""

Step 3: Identify differences
1. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""යනුවෙන්"" (it) as ""The Summer warmth,"" which is a literal translation that does not convey the intended meaning in the context.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""සද්ධර්ම රත්නාවලිය"" (Saddharma Ratnavaliya) as ""fabricated,"" which is a misunderstanding of the term and its meaning, which refers to a sacred text, not something that can be fabricated.
3. The machine translation omits the phrase ""අරුත"" (can be said) from the source, which is crucial for conveying the conditional statement.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of meaning and context. It fails to capture the intended reference to the text ""Saddharma Ratnavaliya"" and incorrectly interprets the source text.

2. **Missing party affiliation**: The source text specifies that the allegations were made by the ""UPN President"" and ""Vice President,"" but the machine translation omits this party affiliation, making it unclear which party the individuals belong to.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the incorrect names of the political figures and the lack of party affiliation, which significantly affects the meaning and accuracy of the translation. The reference translation provides a more faithful representation of the source text.

|Machine translation: A snow bear can hunt a sea bear twice as much as their volume.|
|Reference translation: A polar bear can hunt a sea elephant that weighs twice as much as its body mass.|

Analysis:
1. The source text is about a ""himavalsakut"" (snow bear) hunting a creature based on its size or weight, not a ""sea bear"" as the machine translation suggests. The correct term in the context is likely a ""sea elephant"" or a similar creature, which is more appropriate for a polar bear's prey.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""දේහ"" (size) as ""volume,"" which is not accurate for the context of a bear hunting a large animal based on its body mass.
3. The reference translation uses ""body mass"" to describe the relationship between the prey's size and the bear's hunting ability, which is a more suitable concept than ""volume"" in this context.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation due to the incorrect identification of the prey (sea bear vs. sea elephant) and the use of ""volume"" instead of ""body mass"" to describe the relationship between the two. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: එකල්හි ඒ වනය ෂට්වර්ණ බුදු රැස් වැදී හිරු දහසක්, සඳු දහසක් පෑවුවාක් මෙන් ආලෝකමත් වුණි.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Elephant's forest was a hundred thousand suns, a thousand Mondays light.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: At that time, the forest was illuminated like a thousand suns and a thousand moons were shining from the six colors emitting from the holy rays.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation mentions ""a hundred thousand suns"" and ""a thousand Mondays light,"" which is a literal and somewhat unusual interpretation of the source text. The reference translation, on the other hand, translates ""වැදී"" (forest) as ""illuminated"" and ""අදහසක්"" (days) as ""shining from the six colors.""
- The reference translation adds the detail of ""six colors emitting from the holy rays,"" which is not present in the source text but provides a more vivid and culturally specific image.

Step 5: Identify differences
- The machine translation omits the context of ""at that time"" and the imagery of ""six colors"" and ""holy rays.""
- The machine translation uses a more abstract and less descriptive phrase for the forest's illumination.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the context, the vividness of the imagery, and the specific details about the holy rays and six colors. The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately and provides a more poetic and culturally resonant translation.

|Machine translation: In Wayang Palace at 23, a group of agricultural farmers were killed by vang mang|
|Reference translation: On the 23rd, Wang Mang was killed by a mob of angry farmers inside Weyang Palace|

|Analysis|
1. **Time reference**: The source mentions ""23දී"" (at 23), while the machine translation incorrectly assumes it refers to a specific event within Wayang Palace. The reference translation correctly interprets it as ""On the 23rd"".
2. **Subject**: The source refers to ""කලහකාරී"" (killed farmers), while the machine translation translates it as ""agricultural farmers"" which is not accurate. The reference translation uses ""angry farmers"" which is a more appropriate interpretation.
3. **Location**: The source states ""වෙයෑං"" (Weyang Palace) as the location, but the machine translation omits this detail. The reference translation includes it, specifying ""inside Weyang Palace"".
4. **Victim**: The source mentions ""විසින් මැං"" (Wang Mang), which is not clearly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly identifies the victim as ""Wang Mang"".

In summary, the machine translation has differences in the interpretation of time, the nature of the farmers, and the clarity of the victim's identity. The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation.

Machine translation: These can be produced in pyramids through the enzyme.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: These can be produced in starch by enzymes.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""එන්සයිම"" (enzymes) and ""පිෂ්ඩධාතූන්වල"" (in starch), which refers to a specific substrate for enzyme action.
- The machine translation translates ""එන්සයිම"" as ""through the enzyme"" and omits the context of ""පිෂ්ඩධාතූන්වල"" or ""starch.""

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation incorrectly implies that the enzymes produce something in pyramids, which is not mentioned in the source text.
- The reference translation correctly states that the enzymes produce something in starch.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it incorrectly translates the context of the enzyme's action, specifically mentioning ""pyramids"" instead of ""starch."" The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text.

|Machine translation:| Michael Alcoholic 37, the second day to serve as a travel guide.|
|Reference translation:| Michael Matsuhika 37, the second day he went to work as a tour guide.|

|Analysis:|
1. **Source**: The source text mentions ""මයිකල්"" (Michael) and ""මත්සුහිකා 37"" (Matsuhika 37), which is a name and a number, likely referring to a person. It also mentions ""෷ංචාරක්"" (travel guide) and ""මගපෙන්වන්නෙකු"" (the second day), indicating the context of someone working as a guide on the second day.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""මත්සුහිකා"" (Matsuhika) as ""Alcoholic"", which is a misinterpretation of the name. It also changes the structure to ""the second day to serve as a travel guide"" instead of ""the second day he went to work as a tour guide"", which loses the temporal aspect and the action of going to work.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation correctly keeps the name ""Michael Matsuhika"" and maintains the meaning of ""වන්නෙකු"" (he went) and ""to work"" in the phrase ""he went to work as a tour guide"".

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""Instructions for pregnant women and high blood pressure do not consume durian.""
- Reference translation: ""Pregnant women and people with high blood pressure are advised not to consume durian.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences:
- The machine translation uses ""Instructions"" which is not directly present in the source text. The source text implies advice, but does not explicitly say ""instructions.""
- The machine translation omits the word ""අධි"" (high) before ""රුධිර"" (blood pressure), making it less clear in the translation.
- The verb ""are advised"" in the reference translation is more natural and accurate than ""do not consume"" in the machine translation, as it conveys the same meaning but with a more polite tone.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of clarity, tone, and the absence of the word ""අධි"" for high blood pressure. The reference translation better captures the advice given in the source text.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: But his second son, Myonbok was accepted for it.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""සොහොන්ගැබට"" (entrance to the tomb), while the machine translation uses ""the tomb"" without specifying the entrance. The reference translation correctly includes ""entering the tomb.""
2. The source text refers to ""මමිය වියෝජනය"" (mummy's decomposition), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it says ""the mummy voyage,"" which is a misinterpretation. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""the rate at which the mummy decomposes.""
3. The machine translation uses ""minimize the moisture and temperature"" which is a general term, while the reference translation specifies that the purpose is to ""reduce the rate due to the moisture and temperature caused by tourists entering the tomb,"" which is more accurate.

In summary, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of specificity about the entrance to the tomb, the correct interpretation of ""මමිය වියෝජනය,"" and the cause of the moisture and temperature.

|machine_translation| To prevent drugs and tolerance and circumstances from falling undercover during the tenure.|
|reference_translation| He preaches the Dhamma to prevent drunkenness and procrastination.|

Analysis:

1. **Difference in meaning**: The source text refers to ""අරම්භයේ"" (during the tenure) as a context for the prevention of something, which is not explicitly stated in the machine translation. The reference translation interprets this as ""preaches the Dhamma"" to prevent two specific things: ""මත්බව"" (drunkenness) and ""පිණිස"" (procrastination). The machine translation, on the other hand, translates ""අරම්භයේ"" as ""falling undercover,"" which is a misinterpretation.

2. **Translation of ""අරම්භයේ"":** The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අරම්භයේ"" as ""undercover,"" which does not make sense in this context. The reference translation correctly understands it as referring to the beginning or duration of a period.

3. **Translation of ""අරම්භයේ"":** The source text does not mention ""drugs"" or ""tolerance"" explicitly, but the reference translation infers these from the context of ""අරම්භයේ"" and the mention of ""අරම්භයේ"" (during the tenure). The machine translation, however, translates these concepts separately, which is not accurate.

4. **Translation of ""අරම්භයේ"":** The reference translation uses ""preaches the Dhamma"" as a more direct and culturally appropriate translation for the context, which is a religious teaching in Buddhism. The machine translation does not capture this aspect.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of meaning, context, and cultural nuances. The reference translation provides a more accurate interpretation of the source text, focusing on the prevention of drunkenness and procrastination through the teaching of the Dhamma.

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""කෞතුකාගාරය"" (oil well), while the machine translation uses ""oil well"" without specifying the possessive form. The reference translation correctly adds the possessive 's to indicate it belongs to Derek, so the difference is in the proper noun ""Dirk"" vs ""Derek's"".
2. The machine translation omits the possessive 's for Derek, which is a crucial detail in the context, as it changes the meaning to imply that the oil well is a museum in general, rather than specifically Derek's.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the possessive form of ""Derek"" for ""oil well,"" which is an important distinction in the context. The correct translation should be ""Derek's oil well"" to convey that the oil well belongs to Derek.

|Reference translation:| He learned the Sinhala language under Buddhist monks and learned laymen such as Daskon Adikaram.|

Analysis:

Analysis:
1. The source text is in Sinhala, and the reference translation is a direct and accurate representation of the source, with no changes in meaning.

The machine translation and the reference translation differ in a few key aspects:

1. **Word order and structure**: The machine translation has a slightly different word order, placing ""Holland Aiden's"" before ""determinations"" and using ""profiles of law"" instead of ""various aspects of the law."" In the reference translation, the phrase ""Holland et cetera"" is used to imply a broader context or multiple sources, which is not explicitly mentioned in the machine translation.

2. **Translation of ""නීතියේ විවිධ පැතිකඩ"":** The machine translation translates this phrase as ""profiles of law,"" while the reference translation uses ""various aspects of the law."" The reference translation is more accurate in conveying the idea that the context is about different parts or dimensions of the law, rather than specific profiles.

3. **Reference to sources**: The machine translation does not include the ""et cetera"" part, which is crucial in the reference translation to indicate that the definition is from multiple sources, specifically R. Soltu and possibly other authors.

In summary, the machine translation is less precise in capturing the nuances of the reference translation, particularly in terms of word order, the broader meaning of ""profiles,"" and the acknowledgment of multiple sources. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the original Sinhala text.

|Source: ඇතැම්හු ""ඇතු පුරුද්දට මඟුල් උයනට ගමන් කරනවා"" යැයි කියා ඇතු නවත්වන්නට උත්සාහ කලහ.
|Machine translation: Some ""inside habit"" attempted to stop the fucking garden.
|Reference translation: Some tried to stop the elephant, saying, ""The elephant is in the habit of going to the wedding garden.""

|Analysis|
1. The source text is in Sinhala, discussing an attempt to stop an elephant from going to a specific garden, which is referred to as ""wedding garden"" in the reference translation.
2. The machine translation mistranslates ""ඇතු"" ( elephant) as ""inside habit"" and ""පුරුද්දට"" (wedding garden) as ""fucking garden,"" which are not accurate translations.
3. The verb ""ගමන් කරනවා"" (to go) is not translated in the machine translation, which affects the meaning of the sentence.
4. The phrase ""යැයි"" (saying) is missing in the machine translation, which is crucial for conveying the context of the statement.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: මැස්සාගේ පියාපත රැගෙන යන බින්දු එයින් සුරයක් තනයි.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The binder that carries the fly's wing is suitable.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The drops that carry the fly 's wing make a charm out of it.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""මැස්සා"" (drops), not ""binder"" as in the machine translation.
- The source text uses ""රැගෙන"" (fallen), which implies a natural action, while the machine translation uses ""carries"", which suggests a more active or mechanical action.
- The source text refers to the action of the drops ""මැස්සාගේ"" making ""සුරයක්"" (a charm), which is not directly translated in the machine translation.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text by translating ""මැස්සා"" as ""drops"" and ""රැගෙන"" as ""make a charm out of it"".
- The reference translation also maintains the poetic or metaphorical nature of the phrase, which is lost in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the object being described (drops vs. binder), the action (fallen vs. carries), and the overall meaning (a charm vs. suitability). The reference translation better captures the poetic and cultural context of the Sinhala text.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following aspects:

1. **Omission of context**: The reference translation includes the context ""As the situation worsened"" which provides a clearer understanding of why the deportation occurred. The machine translation omits this crucial context.

2. **Location**: The reference translation specifies ""Jaffna"" as the location of the Catholics, while the machine translation refers to ""this establishment"" without specifying the location, which is incorrect.

3. **Deportation targets**: The reference translation mentions ""Father Jusevas and John"" as the individuals deported, while the machine translation combines them into ""the jesuit fathers of John,"" which is not accurate.

4. **Word order**: The reference translation has a more natural word order, making it easier to read and comprehend.

In summary, the machine translation loses important context, location details, and accurately represents the deportees, leading to a lower quality translation compared to the reference.

|Machine translation: Most of the information about goguryeo is not revealed until many reports are available.
|Reference translation: Much information about Goguryeo has not been revealed, as many reports do not.

Analysis:

1. **Difference in word order**: The source text uses ""ගොගුර්යෝව"" (Goguryeo) at the beginning of the sentence, while the machine translation places it later, after ""information"". The reference translation correctly keeps the subject at the beginning.

2. **Difference in emphasis**: The source text emphasizes that ""information"" is not revealed ""until many reports are available"" (අවල්ලිමිත ප්‍රතිපත්තියන් පෙර) while the machine translation uses ""until"" (අවල්ලිමිත) without specifying the context. The reference translation captures this by saying ""as many reports do not.""

3. **Omission of a word**: The machine translation omits the word ""හෙළිවී"" (revealed) from the source text, which is crucial for conveying the meaning.

4. **Punctuation**: The source text uses a comma (,) after ""reports"" to separate the two clauses, while the machine translation does not. The reference translation includes the comma, which improves the readability.

In summary, the machine translation loses some crucial information and word order, leading to a less accurate representation of the source text compared to the reference translation.|im_end|

|im_start|
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: 12 වැනි සහ වැනි සිය වස්වල සෙන් කෘතීන් බිහි වී තිබුණි.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Zen articles in the 12th and hundredth volumes were created.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Zen works were produced in the 12th century.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation mentions ""Zen articles"" while the reference translation uses ""Zen works."" The term ""works"" is a more general and inclusive term that encompasses various forms of Zen creations, not necessarily limited to articles.
- The machine translation specifies ""12th and hundredth volumes,"" which is likely a mistake, as it suggests two separate volumes with the number 12 and 100. The reference translation correctly implies a single timeframe, the 12th century, without specifying the number of volumes.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The main difference is the specificity of ""articles"" vs. ""works"" and the unnecessary mention of two volumes in the machine translation.
- The reference translation conveys the same general idea as the source text, which is about Zen creations produced during the 12th century, but does so more accurately and coherently.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity and accuracy. It incorrectly translates ""සෙන් කෘතීන්"" (Zen works) as ""Zen articles"" and adds unnecessary details about volumes, which are not present in the source text. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the original Sinhala text.

|Reference translation: The presence of wings, the feet of birds, and the representation of owls as evidence|
|Analysis:|
1. **""පියපත් පැවතීම""** (wingspan) - The machine translation uses ""wingspan for it"" which is not as clear as the reference's ""the presence of wings."" The reference directly states the presence, while the machine translation implies it's related to something.
2. **""පක්ෂීන්ගේ""** (birds') - The machine translation omits the possessive ""of birds"" in ""the feet of birds."" The reference includes this detail.
3. **""බකමූණන්""** (owls) - The machine translation uses ""and owls are represented by evidence"" which is awkward and doesn't convey the meaning of ""the representation of owls"" as in the reference. The reference directly mentions the representation as evidence.

In summary, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of clarity, structure, and the direct representation of the evidence. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Sinhala text.

|analysis|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- Incorrect interpretation of the subject: The machine translation implies that the new member is giving the name, while the source text simply states that a name is being given to the member.
- Incorrect name: The machine translation uses ""Ambulositus Natans"" which is not the correct name provided in the source text. The correct name is ""Ambulocytus natans"" as per the reference translation.

To improve the quality of the translation, the machine should correctly interpret the subject and use the correct name provided in the source text. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Sinhala text.

|im_start|
Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: ""ටවත් පෙනෙන කාරණයක්"" (Another apparent matter)
Machine translation: ""another apparent matter of this service""
The machine translation captures the idea of ""another"" and ""apparent matter"" but omits the word ""this service"" from the source. This is a crucial detail that should be included to provide context.

Step 2: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
Source: ""හිමි වූයේ"" (was that)
Reference translation: ""to receive this treatment""
The machine translation uses ""was that"" which is not a direct translation of ""වූයේ"" in this context. The reference translation correctly conveys the idea of something being done or received.

Step 3: Compare the source text with the reference translation (continued).
Source: ""හට්ෂෙප්සුට්"" (Hatshepsut)
Machine translation: ""the hutshepsut""
The machine translation has a slight error, using ""hutshepsut"" instead of ""Hatshepsut,"" which is a proper noun and should be capitalized.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the reference translation (continued).
Source: ""හට්ෂෙප්සුට් හට"" (to the hutshepsut)

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""සීමා"" (temperature) rather than ""thermodynamic,"" which is a different concept. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""සීමා"" as ""thermodynamic.""
2. The phrase ""අතර"" (while) is not translated in the machine translation, which affects the flow of the sentence.
3. ""නිපදවා"" (made) is translated as ""invented"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate in this context, as it implies a creation rather than a manufacturing process.
4. ""පියාසර කිරීමට"" (to fly) is translated as ""to fly under gravity"" in the machine translation, but the reference translation uses ""it could not fly"" to convey the inability to overcome Earth's gravity.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the wrong interpretation of ""සීමා"" as ""thermodynamic,"" the missing conjunction ""අතර,"" the incorrect translation of ""නිපදවා,"" and the phrasing related to the inability to fly under gravity.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Fingerprints and scratching causes are a type of minimum protective causes.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: A type of protective covering that minimizes fingerprints and scratches.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""minimum protective causes,"" which implies a cause that provides the least amount of protection. 
- The reference translation, on the other hand, describes ""a type of protective covering"" that specifically aims to minimize the effects of fingerprints and scratches, which suggests a product or material designed to prevent or reduce these issues.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation focuses on causes, while the reference translation refers to a protective covering, which is a different concept.
- The reference translation uses the term ""minimizes"" to describe the effect on fingerprints and scratches, whereas the machine translation uses ""minimum protective causes,"" which could be interpreted as a cause rather than an effect.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it incorrectly translates the source text as a type of cause that provides minimum protection, rather than a protective covering that specifically minimizes the effects of fingerprints and scratches.

Analysis:
1. The machine translation uses ""more clearly visible"" which implies a higher degree of clarity, while the reference translation uses ""most evident,"" which suggests a peak or the highest point of visibility. The difference in these phrases changes the emphasis on the age range.
2. The machine translation omits the ""years"" at the end of the age range, which is present in the reference translation. This is a minor difference but important for clarity and accuracy, as it specifies the unit being referred to.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""අධිකරණය"" (adikaranaya), which refers to a court proceeding or indictment, but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""alleged against"" (was alleged against), which implies a accusation without necessarily indicating a formal charge or proceeding.

1. **Term translation**: The source text uses ""අගය"" (value) and ""අරක්ෂාව"" (security) as specific examples, which are translated to ""value and security"" in both the machine and reference translations. However, the machine translation uses ""basic arguments"" instead of ""මූලික වාද"" (key terms), which might lose some nuance in the original context.
2. **Sentence structure**: The machine translation maintains a similar structure to the source, but the reference translation rephrases it to say ""Failure to agree on key terms"" instead of ""The inability to agree with basic arguments"", which makes it clearer that the issue is the lack of agreement on specific terms.
3. **Consequence**: The machine translation states ""can fail the full agreement"" while the reference translation uses ""can lead to the failure of the entire agreement"". Both convey the same idea, but the reference translation is more direct and concise.

4. The machine translation omits the possessive ""වුමුද්ධ"" (its) before ""පැවතිණි"" (remained), which is important to maintain the correct relationship between the photograph and the museum.

In summary, the machine translation loses some context and precision, particularly in the possessive and the specific description of the photograph's popularity. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

|Source: යටත් විජිත යුගයෙන් පරම්පරාවෙන් පරම්පරාවට පැවත ආ ෱ේවය අතිශයින් අමානුෂික හා දුෂ්ඨ|
|Machine translation: Slavery descended from generation within the surreal era was extremely ambitious and villainous|
|Reference translation: Slavery, passed down from generation to generation during the colonial era, was extremely inhuman and cruel|

Analysis:
1. **Source**: The source text refers to ""යටත්"" (colony) and ""විජිත"" (surreal) as a descriptor for the era, not ""සේවය"" (service) as in the machine translation. The correct term to use in this context is ""යුගය"" (era) or ""විජිතය"" (surrealism).
2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""යටත්"" as ""generation within the surreal era"" and omits the context of ""පරම්පරාවෙන්"" (from generation to generation). It also misinterprets ""අතිශයින්"" (inhuman) as ""ambitious"" and ""දුෂ්ඨ"" (cruel) as ""villainous"".
3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text by translating ""යටත්"" as ""colony era"" and maintaining the phrase ""from generation to generation."" It correctly translates ""අතිශයින්"" as ""inhuman"" and ""දුෂ්ඨ"" as ""cruel.""

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of the era description and the interpretation of the adjectives. The reference translation better reflects the meaning and context of the original Sinhala text.

|Source:| භස්මාසුර ශිවගේ හිස ස්පර්ශ කිරීමට උත්සාහ දරන විට|
|Machine translation:| When Bhasmasura tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu imagines Mohini's speed and comes there.|
|Reference translation:| When Bhasmasura tries to touch Shiva 's head, Vishnu disguises himself as Mohini and arrives.|

|Analysis|
1. **""විෂ්ණු""**: In the machine translation, it is translated as ""Vishnu imagines"", while in the reference translation, it is ""Vishnu disguises himself"". The machine translation suggests that Vishnu is visualizing Mohini's speed, which is not the same as disguising himself as her.
2. **""මවාගෙන""**: The machine translation includes this phrase, which is not present in the reference translation. It seems to be a redundant or incorrect addition, as the reference simply states that Vishnu arrives.
3. **""අතැනට""**: The machine translation has this phrase, but it is not necessary in the context. The reference translation omits it, making the sentence more concise.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the action Vishnu takes (imagining speed vs. disguising himself) and the unnecessary addition of ""mwagena."" The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Allium cepa වගා කිරීම මගින්ම දැනගත්තාවූ සුවිශේෂී වර්ගයකි.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Allium cepa is a peculiar species known by the genus Allium.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Allium cepa is a unique variety known for its cultivation.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation describes Allium cepa as a ""peculiar species"" while the reference translation calls it a ""unique variety.""
- The machine translation mentions it being ""known by the genus Allium,"" which is a general statement, whereas the reference translation specifies that it is known for its cultivation.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The main difference lies in the description of the species, with ""peculiar"" in the machine translation implying an unusual or odd characteristic, while ""unique variety"" in the reference translation suggests a distinctiveness based on its cultivation.
- The reference translation adds context by highlighting the reason for its uniqueness, which is cultivation, which is not present in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the description of the species and the emphasis on cultivation as the reason for its uniqueness. The machine translation could be improved by incorporating the aspect of cultivation in its description.

|Machine translation: About 15 such lengths can be seen at the foot of the kuruga.|
|Reference translation: About 15 such caves can be seen at the foot of the rock near Kuragala.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""කුලුගල්"" (kulugala), which refers to a specific type of formation or feature, likely caves, in the context of the mountain. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""lengths,"" which does not convey the intended meaning of a cave.
2. The reference translation specifies ""rock"" as the base where the caves are found, which is not present in the machine translation. This detail is important for understanding the location accurately.
3. The reference translation adds ""near Kuragala"" to provide context, which is not included in the machine translation.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""kulugala"" as ""lengths"" instead of ""caves,"" and it lacks the detail about the rock and the location near Kuragala. The quality of the translation could be improved by capturing the specific context and meaning of the original Sinhala text.

|Machine translation: Peak, dry during the summer and again during the rainy season|
|Reference translation: The top dries out in summer and grows back in the rainy season.|
|Analysis:|
1. **Sinhala to English Vocabulary Translation**: The machine translation seems to struggle with the Sinhala words ""මුදුනත"" (the top) and ""ගිම්හානයේදී"" (in the dry season), which are not directly translated to ""Peak"" and ""summer"" respectively. Instead, it uses ""Peak"" which is a more general term for the highest point, and ""dry during the summer"" which is a partial translation of the source's ""ගිම්හානයේදී වියළී"" (dry during the dry season).
2. **Sentence Structure**: The machine translation does not capture the intended meaning of ""අවසර්"" (again) in the source, which refers to the cycle of drying out and growing back. Instead, it translates it as ""and again during the rainy season,"" which suggests a repetition of dryness, which is not accurate.
3. **Temporal Context**: The reference translation correctly conveys the seasonal context, stating that the top dries out in summer and grows back in the rainy season. The machine translation, however, does not clearly express this connection.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of vocabulary, sentence structure, and the accurate representation of the seasonal context. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the original Sinhala sentence.

Machine translation: How exactly do you say it's 49 million years old fossil?
Source text: How exactly can you say that by looking at a 49 million year old fossil?

Step 3: Identify differences
- The machine translation uses ""it's"" which is a contraction, while the source text uses ""can you say that"" for a more direct question.
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""by looking at"" from the source text, which is important for understanding the context of the question.

Step 4: Compare with the reference translation
Reference translation: How exactly can you say that by looking at a 49 million year old fossil?

Step 5: Analyze the quality
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation because it loses the nuance of the original question and omits a crucial part of the context (looking at the fossil). The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

|Reference translation: It is a guide, an example that guides mankind and is a complete plan of life that came down in Arabic from Allah, the Creator of man, for the last time.

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""එය"" which means ""it"" in Sinhala. The machine translation translates this as ""a guide to the human race"", while the reference translation correctly renders it as ""a guide"".
2. The phrase ""මිනිස්"" is translated as ""the last of the Allah"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly understands it as ""the last of the Arabic"" and refers to the language, not Allah.
3. The phrase ""අවසාන"" means ""end"" or ""last"" in Sinhala. The machine translation incorrectly connects it to Allah mothering something, while the reference translation correctly connects it to the life plan coming down from Allah.
4. The phrase ""අරාබි"" refers to Arabic, and the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""lower elements"", which is not a suitable translation. The reference translation correctly uses ""Arabic"" to describe the language.
5. The phrase ""අවසාන වරට"" means ""for the last time"" in Sinhala. The machine translation omits this part, while the reference translation includes it, providing a clearer context.

In summary, the machine translation has several inaccuracies, particularly in the interpretation of ""මිනිස්"" and the connection to Allah, and it misses the context of the phrase ""අවසාන වරට"". The reference translation provides a more accurate and coherent translation.

The machine translation seems to have a few issues compared to the reference translation:

1. **Source word meaning**: The source text mentions ""එසේම"" (esēm), which is a Sinhala word that refers to ""Nonean"" in English, a term likely referring to a person's name. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""record of Nonean Howard Carter,"" which is a phrase rather than a direct translation of the name.

2. **Grammar**: The source text uses ""වාර්තාවක්"" (vārtāvaka) to indicate possession, meaning ""of the story"" or ""of the event."" The machine translation omits this possessive aspect, resulting in a less clear meaning.

3. **Sentence structure**: The reference translation rephrases the source to say ""He also used Howard Carter's report"" which is a more natural and clear way to convey the information in English. The machine translation, on the other hand, starts with ""Also utilized the record,"" which is awkward and does not directly connect to the subject.

4. **Cremation**: The reference translation states that the body was ""cremated,"" which is a direct translation of the implied meaning in the source text. The machine translation does not mention the act of cremation, which is a key point in the context.

In summary, the machine translation loses the specific reference to the name ""Howard Carter"" and the act of cremation, and has issues with grammar and sentence structure. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

|Machine translation: Wu Weiliang and wu huaiyuan were sentenced to death.|
|Reference translation: Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyuan were sentenced to death.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text is in Sinhala, a language that uses a different script and grammar from English. The machine translation correctly identifies the names ""වූ වෙයිලියෑං"" (Wu Weiliang) and ""වූ හුවායියුවෑන්ට"" (Wu Huaiyuan) as proper names, which are transliterated into English as ""Wu Weiliang"" and ""Wu Huaiyuan.""
2. The machine translation accurately captures the meaning of ""මරණ දඬුවම"" (sentenced to death) in English.
3. The only difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the capitalization of ""Wu"" in the names. In the reference translation, proper nouns are typically capitalized, which is a common practice in English.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with the main difference being the capitalization of the names, which is a stylistic choice in the reference translation. The core information, including the names and the sentence, is correctly conveyed. The quality of the translation can be considered high, given the context and the preservation of meaning.|

1. The source text in Sinhala discusses the extent to which the speaker is aware of any harm or negative impact (අයුරකින්) they may have caused to their brother (මගේ සොයුරාට).

|Machine translation: But by 1877, westernized Tokyo and Osaka cities and compared, Saul and Busan were like the balance of ancient history.|
|Reference translation: But by 1877 , compared to the westernized cities of Tokyo and Osaka , Seoul and Busan looked like remnants of ancient history.|

|Analysis|
1. **Time reference**: The machine translation does not include the ""vන්"" (at that time) from the source, which is crucial to convey the context of the comparison happening in 1877.
2. **City names**: The machine translation uses ""Saul"" instead of ""සෝල්"" (Seoul) and ""Busan"" is not mentioned at all. The reference translation correctly translates these city names.
3. **Comparison**: The machine translation uses ""the balance of ancient history"" which is not as accurate as the reference's ""remnants of ancient history"" to describe the appearance of Seoul and Busan in relation to the westernized cities.
4. **Sentence structure**: The machine translation has a slightly awkward structure, with ""and compared"" inserted, which is not present in the reference translation. The reference translation flows more naturally with the comparison.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of time reference, city names, comparison, and sentence structure. The reference translation provides a more accurate and natural representation of the source text.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: මෙය වර්තමානය වන විට (This is presently)
Machine translation: This is presently
Reference translation: This has now (This is currently in the present)

Difference: The machine translation uses ""growing up to"" instead of ""developed into"" or ""presently"", which changes the meaning from a current state to a process of growth.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: an uneventful pointed social impact
Reference translation: an unresolved protracted social conflict

Difference: The machine translation uses ""uneventful"" and ""pointed"" to describe the social impact, which are not present in the reference translation. The reference translation uses ""unresolved"" and ""protracted"" to convey a more complex and ongoing situation.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the progression of the situation (growth vs. development) and the nature of the social conflict (uneventful and pointed vs. unresolved and protracted). The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the original Sinhala text.

|Machine translation: And, a crew member, hiding in the bags of letters, secretly an escape from the ship that had been reported in this port|
|Reference translation: A crew member was also reported to have sneaked out of the ship, hiding in envelopes at the port|

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""වාර්තාවී"" which means ""while this event"" or ""at this time,"" but the machine translation omits this context, making it unclear when the crew member's action took place.
2. The machine translation uses ""secretly an escape"" which is a phrase, while the reference translation separates it into ""secretly"" and ""an escape,"" making the meaning clearer.
3. The source text uses ""ලියුම් මලු"" to refer to ""bags of letters,"" but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""bags of letters"" without the article ""වා"" (of), which is present in the reference translation.
4. The reference translation correctly uses ""envelopes"" (අවස්ථාවලින්) to describe the hiding place, while the machine translation omits this detail.

Overall, the machine translation loses some context and accuracy in terms of word choice and structure, leading to a less clear and precise translation compared to the reference.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Islam has several instances of translation released in history.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: There have been several instances in which translations of Islamic history have been issued.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""Islam has several instances of translation released in history,"" while the reference translation says ""There have been several instances in which translations of Islamic history have been issued.""
- The main difference lies in the structure and emphasis of the sentence. The machine translation attributes the action of translation to Islam directly, while the reference translation emphasizes the occurrence of these instances in the context of Islamic history.
- The reference translation also uses ""in which"" to introduce a clause that describes the circumstances, which is not present in the machine translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the sentence structure and emphasis. The reference translation provides a clearer context by specifying that the translations are of Islamic history, and it uses a relative clause to describe the instances. The machine translation, on the other hand, implies that Islam itself is the entity doing the translations, which is not the intended meaning.

|Machine translation:| Aid species have kept some records of their evolutionary history.
|Reference translation:| Ancient species have left some records in their evolutionary history.

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""අදී"" (ancient) which is translated as ""Aid"" in the machine translation. This is a mistranslation, as ""අදී"" does not mean ""aid"" but rather ""ancient"" or ""old"" in the context of Sinhala.
2. ""විශේෂ"" (specific) is translated as ""species"" in the machine translation, which is a correct translation but loses the connotation of ""specific"" or ""unique"" in Sinhala.
3. ""පරිණාමික"" (evolutionary) is translated accurately as ""of their evolutionary history"" in both translations.
4. ""වාර්තා"" (record) is translated as ""records"" in both translations, which is correct.
5. ""ගොස්"" (kept) is not present in the machine translation, which might be a loss of information or a mistranslation.

Overall, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the word ""අදී"" and the connotation of ""විශේෂ"" being lost. The correct translation should be ""අදින්"" (ancient) instead of ""Aid"" and ""විශේෂ"" (specific) to maintain the original meaning. The rest of the translation is accurate, but the differences in these key terms affect the quality of the translation.

|Machine translation:| When he was only ten years old, his brother died of unknown causes three years later.|
|Reference translation:| When he was about ten years old, his brother ruled for three years and died of unknown causes.|

|Analysis:|
1. **Time frame**: The source text mentions ""වයස අවුරුදු"" (about ten years old), which is not clearly translated as ""only ten years old"" in the machine translation. The reference translation uses ""about"" to convey a similar uncertainty about the exact age.
2. **Brother's actions**: The source text implies that the brother's death occurred after a certain event, but it does not specify that he ruled. The machine translation adds the detail that the brother ""ruled for three years,"" which is not present in the source.
3. **Sequence of events**: The machine translation presents the brother's death as happening ""three years later,"" which might imply a direct connection to the initial age mention. However, the reference translation suggests a sequence where the brother ruled for three years before dying, which is a more plausible interpretation based on the source.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the brother's age, the implied sequence of events (ruling before dying), and the addition of the brother ruling for three years, which is not directly supported by the source text. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the original Sinhala sentence.

1. **Source meaning**: The source text talks about a ""සෙසු රෝග"" (seisu rog), which refers to a specific type of illness or condition that led to the person's ""අකල් මරණයට"" (akal maramaya), meaning his death.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""අකල් මරණයට"" as ""ukulele death,"" which is a literal translation that does not convey the intended meaning of the original text. The source text is discussing a death, not specifically related to an ukulele.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation correctly translates ""අකල් මරණයට"" as ""untimely death,"" which captures the idea that the person's death was premature or unexpected.

4. **Other causes**: Both the source and the reference translation mention ""other causes"" (යින් තිබිණි) for the death, but the machine translation omits this context, making it sound like the illustrations were proposed as the sole cause.

5. **Illustrations**: The source text does not explicitly mention ""illustrations"" (යින් තිබිණි) as part of the discussion, but the reference translation implies that they were suggested as part of the explanation for the untimely death.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation by misinterpreting the cause of death and losing the context about other suggested causes. The reference translation provides a more accurate and coherent representation of the source text.

- Reference translation: ""A large crowd gathered to welcome the arrival of the Rev. Fr.""

Differences:
1. ""The Father"" in the machine translation is not specific, while the reference translation refers to ""the Rev. Fr."" which is likely a reference to a Catholic priest.
2. ""accept a group of Catholics"" in the machine translation suggests an acceptance process, while the reference translation simply states the crowd is there to welcome the arrival.
3. ""from the sides of its gathering"" in the machine translation is unclear, while the reference translation implies the crowd is gathered around the arrival.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of specificity, clarity, and the context of the gathering. The reference translation provides a clearer picture of a crowd welcoming a Catholic priest, while the machine translation implies a more general acceptance process.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: There [ [ The Battle of Tiantxin _ fierce battles in Tientxin ] ] erupted.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""the battle of tientzin _ the terrible battle of tientzin"" which suggests two separate battles, while the reference translation combines them into ""The Battle of Tiantxin _ fierce battles in Tientxin"" implying a single event with intensity.
- The reference translation uses ""erupted"" to convey the action, which is not directly translated in the machine translation.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation is less concise and might lead to confusion about the context, as it repeats ""the battle of tientzin"" and adds ""terrible"" unnecessarily.
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately by indicating a single significant event (The Battle of Tiantxin) and emphasizing the intensity (fierce battles).

|Analysis:|
1. The source text starts with ""tatpar"" which means ""immediately"" or ""right away"" in Sinhala. The machine translation omits this context, which is important to convey the urgency of the event.
2. The source uses ""අතර"" (athara), which means ""while"" or ""as"" and connects two events. The machine translation does not include this, making the connection between the bombs exploding and the location less clear.
3. The source specifies ""පුපුරා"" (pupura), which means ""underground"" or ""subway"" in Sinhala. The machine translation translates this as ""subway trains,"" which is redundant and less precise than the reference's ""subway.""
4. The reference translation uses ""had exploded"" to indicate the past completed action, which is not present in the machine translation. This is important for the correct temporal sequence.

In summary, the machine translation loses crucial context and nuances, such as the immediacy of the event and the connection between the bombs and the subway system.

The machine translation rephrases this as ""In grave paintings"" and then mentions the preservation. The reference translation directly connects ""Goguryeo art"" with ""well preserved"" and ""tomb paintings"".

2. **Preservation**: The source uses ""අතිරේක"" (atirek) or ""අතිරේකයින්"" (atirekayini) to imply that the preservation is something that can be observed, while the machine translation uses ""as being preserved"" which is a more passive construction. The reference translation uses ""well preserved"" which conveys the same meaning but more directly.

3. **Word order**: The source sentence places ""ගොගුර්යෝ කලාව"" (Goguryeo kalav) at the end, while the machine translation moves it to the middle. The reference translation keeps the same order as the source.

4. **Adjectives**: The source does not use any adjectives to describe the preservation, while the machine translation uses ""as being preserved"" which implies a passive state. The reference translation uses ""well preserved"" which is a more positive and descriptive adjective.

Overall, the machine translation captures the main idea but loses some nuance and word order from the source. The reference translation is a more accurate and natural adaptation of the source text, maintaining the focus on the preservation of Goguryeo art in tomb paintings.

|Machine translation: • The Governor has the ability to develop his powers due to concentration and inhibition|
|Reference translation: Growing power of the Governor due to his emphasized and veto power |

Analysis:

1. **Sinhala words**: The source text uses ""අවධාරිත"" (concentration) and ""නිෂේධ"" (veto) in Sinhala, which are not directly translated into ""concentration"" and ""inhibition"" in the machine translation. Instead, the machine translation seems to interpret these terms as related to the development of powers, which is not accurate.

2. **Meaning**: The machine translation suggests that the Governor's powers are developed because of concentration and inhibition, which implies a control or limitation. However, the reference translation correctly captures the meaning as the Governor's power growing due to the emphasis (අවධාරිත) and the veto power (නිෂේධ).

3. **Structure**: The structure of the sentence is slightly different in the machine translation. The reference translation places ""due to his"" after ""Growing power,"" while the machine translation separates the cause and effect within the sentence.

4. **Translation quality**: The machine translation loses the nuance of the original Sinhala text, particularly in the terms ""අවධාරිත"" and ""නිෂේධ."" The reference translation better reflects the intended meaning and structure.

Analysis:
1. The source text talks about ""වාෂ්ප"" (steam) and ""නිපදවීම"" (navigation) or ""පවත්වය"" (availability) in the context of supporting the ""කාර්මාන්තය"" (oil industry) using ""වාෂ්ප පවත්වය"" (steam power).
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""වාෂ්ප නැව්"" (steam ships) as ""steamships"" and omits the word ""අවිස්සා"" (impossible) which is implied in the source text.
3. The machine translation states that the oil industry was ""an impossible energy without steam power,"" which is not accurate. The source text suggests that steam power was necessary for the oil industry's sustenance, not that it was impossible without it.
4. The reference translation captures the essence of the source text by saying ""steam power became an indispensable force for sustaining the oil industry,"" which aligns with the intended meaning.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the necessity of steam power for the oil industry and the absence of the word ""අවිස්සා"" (impossible). The reference translation better conveys the meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
|Source: මේ අතර ජර්මන් සම්භවයක් ඇති බෞද්ධ භික්ෂුවක් 'සතුරු හමුදාවේ' යයි සැක කොට සිර ගත කරන ලදී.
|Machine translation: Meanwhile, a Buddhist monk in the German s ' hostile army was suspected of being imprisoned.
|Reference translation: Meanwhile, a Buddhist monk of German descent was imprisoned on suspicion of being in the ' enemy army '.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions a ""German sambhava"" (German connection), which refers to the monk's German background. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""German s"" and omits the word ""descent,"" leading to a loss of meaning.
2. The source uses the term 'සතුරු හමුදාවේ' (in the 'enemy army'), which is a direct quote or a way to express the monk's alleged affiliation. The machine translation renders it as 'hostile army', which is a less precise translation and does not convey the same sense of being part of an opposing force.
3. The verb ""සැක කොට"" (was imprisoned) is correctly translated in both the machine and reference translations.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its handling of the monk's German connection and the description of the 'enemy army', losing the nuance and accuracy of the original text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>
