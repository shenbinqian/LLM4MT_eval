A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Neid viimaseid asju ei pruugi mõistuspärane toimija soovida, õieti ei tohi soovida, selleks et olla mõistuspärane soovija.""
- Machine translation: ""These last things may not be wanted by a rational player, or perhaps not wanted, in order to be a rational wish.""

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""õieti ei tohi"" (literally, ""it is not allowed to""), which is present in the source text. This phrase adds a nuance that the act of wanting these things might be prohibited for a rational actor.
- The machine translation uses ""rational player"" instead of ""mõistuspärane toimija"" (rational actor), which is a direct translation but loses the specific Estonian term.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: ""These last things may not be wanted by a rational actor, or more accurately, should not be wanted, in order to be a rational wish-maker.""

Step 4: Analyze the differences between the machine and reference translations.
- The reference translation adds the phrase ""more accurately"" to emphasize that the prohibition is not just a possibility but a stronger recommendation.
- The reference translation changes ""rational wish"" to ""rational wish-maker,"" which better reflects the intention of the original text, as it implies the actor's ability to make rational decisions about their desires.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the nuance conveyed by the phrase ""õieti ei tohi"" and the more precise term ""rational wish-maker"" instead of ""rational wish."" The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the original Estonian text.

|Source: Tuleb otsustada, kui suur erinevus on selle vahel, mida ta tegi, ja tegude vahel, mis näitavad meile mõrva tõsidust.|
|Machine translation: It is important to decide what a difference there is between what he has done and the actions that show us the gravity of the murder.|
|Reference translation: It is important to decide how big a difference there is between what he has done and the actions that show us the gravity of the murder.|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation uses ""what a difference"" instead of ""how big a difference"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference but affects the meaning slightly, as ""how big"" implies a more quantitative assessment of the difference, while ""what"" could be interpreted more generally.
2. The phrase ""mida ta tegi"" in the source text is translated as ""what he has done"" in both, which is accurate.
3. The phrase ""mõrva tõsidust"" in the source text is translated as ""the gravity of the murder"" in both, which is a direct and appropriate translation.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but loses a bit of nuance in the expression of the degree of difference. The reference translation provides a clearer sense of the required assessment, which the machine translation could improve upon by using ""how big"" instead of ""what a.""

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
- Source: Esimesel päeval kohtus ta Kiievis Ukraina peaministri Viktor Janukovõtšiga ja presidendi Viktor Juštšenkoga.
- Machine translation: On the first day in Kiev, he met Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and President Viktor Yushchenko.
- Reference translation: On the first day, he met in Kiev with Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and President Viktor Yushchenko.

The source sentence starts with ""Esimesel päeval"" (on the first day) and then describes the meeting location (Kiievis) and the individuals met. The machine translation and reference translation both convey the same information but with a slight difference in structure.

Step 2: Check for differences in word order
- Machine translation: ""On the first day in Kiev""
- Reference translation: ""On the first day""

The machine translation adds ""in Kiev"" after ""the first day,"" which is not necessary in the reference translation. The reference keeps the phrase ""in Kiev"" as a prepositional phrase, which is more natural in English.

Step 3: Compare the names
- Source: Viktor Janukovõtšiga ja presidendi Viktor Juštšenkoga
- Machine translation: Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and President Viktor Yushchenko
- Reference translation: Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and President Viktor Yushchenko

The names are correctly translated in both the machine and reference translations, but the source uses the full name with the patronymic (Janukovõtšiga and Juštšenkoga), while the machine and reference translations use the last name only.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of word order, specifically placing ""in Kiev"" after ""the first day"" instead of as a prepositional phrase. Additionally, the source includes the patronymic in the names, while the machine and reference translations use only the last names. The overall meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is more natural and idiomatic in English.

|Source: Eesti diplomaatilist esindust ega aukonsulit riigis ei ole.|
|Machine translation: There is no Estonian diplomatic representation or honorary consul in the country.|
|Reference translation: There is no Estonian diplomatic mission or honorary consul in the country.|

Analysis:
1. **""Eesti diplomaatilist esindust""** (Estonian diplomatic representation) - The machine translation captures the essence of ""diplomatic representation"" but omits the adjective ""Eesti"" (Estonian), which is crucial for identifying the nationality. The reference translation includes this detail.
2. **""ega aukonsulit""** (or honorary consul) - The machine translation includes both ""diplomatic representation"" and ""honorary consul"" as separate phrases, while the reference translation combines them into ""diplomatic mission"" which is a more general term that encompasses both. The reference is more concise and accurate.
3. **""riigis ei ole""** (is not in the country) - Both the machine and reference translations convey the same meaning.

In summary, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it separates ""diplomatic representation"" and ""honorary consul"" into distinct phrases, while the reference combines them into ""diplomatic mission."" Additionally, the machine translation omits the adjective ""Estonian"" from the source, which is important for clarity. The reference translation is more precise and faithful to the source text.

1. **Metallid muutuvad raskemaks** (Machine Translation) vs **heavier** (Reference Translation): The machine translation uses ""more difficult"" instead of ""heavier."" In the context of metals changing due to a chemical process like rusting, ""heavier"" is the correct term to describe the increase in mass, not difficulty.

2. **roostetades** (Machine Translation) vs **rust** (Reference Translation): The machine translation has ""roostetades,"" which is likely a typo or a mistranslation. The correct term for the process of metal corroding and turning into rust is ""rust"" in English.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the choice of words ""more difficult"" instead of ""heavier"" to describe the change in metals and the incorrect use of ""roostetades"" for the process of rusting. The correct translation should be ""Some Islamic chemists already knew that some metals would become heavier when they rust.""

|Source: Renneri kroonika kohaselt läksid järgnevalt ""kuningad eestlastega edasi ja piirasid Tallinnat kümne tuhande mehega"".|
|Machine translation: According to the chronics of Renner, 'kings passed on to the Estonians and restricted Tallinn to ten thousand men'.|
|Reference translation: According to the chronicle of Renner, the kings then "" continued with the Estonians and besieged Tallinn with ten thousand men "" .|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""kohaselt"" which means ""according to"" or ""as it is written in"" in Estonian. The machine translation omits this phrase, making it less clear that the information is from the chronicle.
2. The verb ""laskid"" in the source text means ""went"" or ""proceeded"" in the context of the kings moving forward. The machine translation uses ""passed on to"", which is not an exact equivalent and implies a transfer of power rather than a physical movement.
3. The verb ""piirasid"" means ""surrounded"" or ""hemmed in"" in Estonian. The machine translation uses ""restricted"", which could imply limiting access or rights, but does not convey the sense of a military encirclement.
4. The phrase ""kümne tuhande mehega"" means ""with ten thousand men"" in Estonian. The machine translation accurately translates this part.

|Improvement|
To improve the machine translation, it should include the phrase ""kohaselt"" for clarity, and use a verb like ""continued"" or ""marched"" to better convey the movement of the kings. Additionally, the word ""besieged"" would be a more accurate translation for ""piirasid"" to maintain the context of a military action. The final revised translation could be:

""According to the chronicle of Renner, the kings then continued with the Estonians and besieged Tallinn with ten thousand men, as it is written.""

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Popperi demarkatsioonikriteerium teaduse ja pseudoteaduse vahel nägi ette, et teooria peab olema falsifitseeritav.
Machine translation: The Popperi démarches criterion between science and pseudo-science stipulated that theory must be homogenised.

Step 2: Identify key differences.
- ""demarkatsioonikriteerium"" (demarkation criterion) is translated as ""dembarkes criterion"" (a misspelling or incorrect term).
- ""nägi ette"" (saw or recognized) is translated as ""stipulated"" (implies a rule or requirement, but not the act of seeing or recognizing).
- ""falsifitseeritav"" (falsifiable) is translated as ""homogenised"" (which is unrelated to falsifiability).

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Popper's demarcation criterion between science and pseudo-science stipulated that theory must be falsified.

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The correct term for Popper's demarcation criterion is used in the reference translation (""Popper's"").
- The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of ""nägi ette"" as ""stipulated"" (although the verb tense is not the same, the meaning is clear).
- The reference translation correctly translates ""falsifitseeritav"" as ""falsified,"" which is the key concept in Popper's philosophy.

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the term for Popper's criterion, the verb ""nägi ette,"" and the concept of falsifiability. The machine translation is not accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is a more faithful representation of the original Estonian text.

3. Read the reference translation: ""Water is relatively clean, even though sludge gathers in some places.""
4. Compare the source and machine translation: The machine translation uses ""are gathering sludge"" while the reference translation uses ""sludge gathers."" The verb tense is slightly different, with the reference using the simple present tense (""gathers"") and the machine translation using the present continuous tense (""are gathering"").
5. Compare the source and reference translation: The source text uses ""muda"" which is the Estonian word for ""sludge,"" and the reference translation accurately captures this as ""sludge.""
6. Analyze the difference: The main difference is the verb tense, which affects the flow and nuance of the sentence. The machine translation's continuous tense suggests a process happening in the present, while the reference's simple present tense is more straightforward and does not imply a continuous action.

|im_end|>
Final evaluation: The machine translation is different from the reference translation mainly in the verb tense, with the machine using the present continuous tense (""are gathering"") instead of the simple present tense (""gathers""). This difference slightly alters the sentence's emphasis and implies a continuous process in the machine translation, which is not explicitly stated in the source text or the reference. Overall, the meaning is preserved, but the choice of tense affects the clarity and naturalness of the translation.

|Machine translation: The General Affairs Council has made the final preparations to direct the draft EU budget to the European Council.|
|Reference translation: The General Affairs Council has made the final preparations to forward the draft EU budget to the European Council meeting.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""viimased ettevalmistused"" (final preparations), which is translated as ""the final preparations"" in both the machine and reference translations. This part is accurately conveyed.
2. The source text specifies ""Euroopa Liidu eelarveprojekti suunamiseks"" (aimed at directing the EU budget project), which is translated as ""to direct the draft EU budget"" in the machine translation. The reference translation adds ""to the"" before ""European Council meeting,"" which is a more precise way of expressing the destination of the preparations, as it implies the action will happen during the meeting.
3. The source text includes ""Euroopa Ülemkogu kohtumisele"" (to the European Council meeting), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it is implied by the phrase ""to the European Council."" The reference translation explicitly states ""European Council meeting,"" making it clearer.

In summary, the machine translation is accurate in conveying the main idea but omits the explicit mention of the meeting in the destination. The reference translation provides a clearer and more contextually accurate translation by specifying ""European Council meeting.""|im_end|

|Source: Mileetose koolkonna filosoofide järgi pärinevad kõik asjad ühest ürgalgest.| |Machine translation: According to the philosophers in Mileetos School, all the things come from one spinary.| |Reference translation: According to the philosophers of the Milesian school, all things come from one primordial origin.| 

|Analysis:|
1. **""Mileetose koolkonna""** vs. **""Mileetos School""**: The source text uses ""koolkonna"" which is the Estonian word for ""school"" with a genitive ending, while the machine translation translates it as ""School"" without specifying the genitive case. The reference translation correctly uses ""Milesian school"" to indicate the origin.
2. **""filosoofide""** vs. **""philosophers""**: The source text refers to ""filosoofide"" (plural of philosophers), while the machine translation omits the plural form and uses ""philosophers"" in singular. The reference translation also uses ""philosophers"" in plural.
3. **""järgi""** vs. **""following""**: The source text uses ""järgi"" which means ""following"" or ""according to"" in Estonian. The machine translation translates it as ""following"" but omits the preposition, while the reference translation includes ""of"" to connect ""philosophers"" and ""origin.""
4. **""pärinevad""** vs. **""come""**: The source text uses the verb ""pärinevad"" (originate), which is in the present tense. The machine translation uses ""come"" in the present tense, but the reference translation uses ""come"" in the same tense, but with the correct preposition ""from.""
5. **""ühest ürgalgest""** vs. **""one spinary""**: The source text uses ""ühest ürgalgest"" which can be translated as ""from one origin"" or ""from a single source."" The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""one spinary,"" which is not a recognized term in English. The reference translation uses ""primordial origin,"" which is a more accurate and common term.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in terms of genitive case, plural form, prepositions, and the use of a non-standard term. The reference translation provides a more accurate and natural English equivalent of the source text.

|Reference translation: From the complex theories that philosophy must develop, we must return to simple and obvious facts.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject omission**: The machine translation omits the subject ""me"" or ""we"" from the reference translation, which is necessary to indicate who is performing the action of returning to simple facts. The source text does not specify a particular subject, but the reference translation adds ""we"" to make the sentence more clear.

2. **Word order**: The machine translation has a slightly different word order, placing ""simple and obvious facts"" after ""be returned,"" while the reference translation places it after ""return to."" This difference is minor and does not significantly alter the meaning.

3. **Tense**: The machine translation uses the present tense ""must be returned,"" while the reference translation uses the infinitive form ""we must return."" Both are grammatically correct, but the infinitive form is more common in English when expressing a general action.

4. **Punctuation**: The source text does not have any punctuation, but the reference translation adds a comma after ""develop"" for better readability. This is a stylistic choice and does not affect the core meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the subject and has a slightly different word order. The reference translation provides a clearer and more natural-sounding sentence in English, while preserving the original meaning.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Ja kui ongi, siis püüab Laine need kohe välja selgitada.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: And if so, the loan will try to identify them straight away.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: And if so, Laine will try to identify them at once.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""Laine"" (a proper noun, likely a person's name), while the machine translation refers to ""the loan"" (a financial entity, not a person).
- The source text uses ""need"" (referring to something that needs to be identified), while the machine translation omits this word, making it unclear what is being identified.
- The source text has ""kohe välja selgitada"" (immediately explain or clarify), which is translated to ""straight away"" in the reference translation, conveying the same meaning.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The main difference lies in the subject, as the machine translation incorrectly attributes the action to ""the loan"" instead of ""Laine"" as in the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it incorrectly identifies the subject (Laine vs. the loan) and omits the word ""need,"" which is crucial for understanding what is being referred to. The overall meaning is similar, but the accuracy and clarity are compromised due to these differences.

Machine translation: Although Darwin had the last 22 years of life in the hands of periodic disease care, this did not prevent him from continuing his work.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- The machine translation uses ""periodic disease care"" instead of ""perioodiliste haigushoogude käes"" (which means ""in the hands of periodic diseases"").
- The machine translation omits the word ""vaevles"" (which means ""suffered"" or ""struggled"" in this context), making the sentence less clear about the nature of Darwin's condition.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Although Darwin suffered from periodic diseases for the last 22 years of his life, this did not prevent him from continuing his work.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation captures the idea that Darwin was dealing with periodic diseases, using ""suffered from"" to convey the struggle or difficulty.
- The reference translation is more faithful to the source text in terms of conveying the struggle Darwin faced.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its choice of words and the way it expresses Darwin's struggle with periodic diseases. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

Machine translation: The elections were won by the opposition Australian Labour Party.

Difference analysis:
- The source text starts with ""Valimised"" (Estonian for ""Elections""), while the machine translation omits this word, assuming it from context.
- The verb ""võitis"" (Estonian for ""won"") is translated as ""were won"" in the machine translation, which is a correct past tense form but loses the active voice.

- The reference translation uses ""The election"" instead of ""The elections"", which is more accurate as it refers to a singular event, assuming there was only one election in the context.
- Both translations use ""opposition Australian Labour Party"", which is consistent.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
1. It omits ""Valimised"" (Elections), which is crucial for clarity.

|Analysis|
1. The source text starts with ""Üks omapärasemaid,"" which translates to ""One of the most original"" in both the machine and reference translations. This part is correctly translated.
2. ""Minose kultuuri"" refers to ""the Minoan culture"" in English. The machine translation omits ""culture"" and instead uses ""architectural architecture,"" which is redundant and incorrect. The reference translation correctly includes ""culture.""
3. ""arhitektuuri sümboleid"" means ""architectural symbols"" in English. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""architectural architecture,"" which is not a proper term. The reference translation is accurate.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Ta palkas Montréali ajakirjaniku Michael Woloschuki, saamaks selgust isa elukäigus.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: He asked the Montréal journalist Michael Woloschuk to get clarity in his life.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: He hired a Montréal journalist Michael Woloschuk to get clarity about his father's life.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the source text, ""palkas"" means ""hired"" or ""paid"" (referring to hiring someone for a task), while the machine translation uses ""asked"", which is not an accurate representation of the action.
- The source mentions ""isa elukäigus"" which means ""father's life"" in Estonian, but the machine translation omits this context, translating it as ""his life"" without specifying the father.
- The verb ""saamaks"" (to get) in the source is translated as ""to get"" in the machine translation, but the context is about gaining clarity, which is more accurately expressed in the reference as ""to get clarity about"".

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the verb choice (hiring vs. asking) and the lack of specificity about the father's life in the translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the original source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

|im_start|>|im_sep|>|ref|: Normal science in general keeps a distance from philosophy, and probably rightly so.|>|mt|: Normal science in general is keeping the philosophy away, and rightly so.|>|diff|:

1. **Distance vs. Keeping away**: The machine translation uses ""keeping the philosophy away"" which implies a more absolute separation, while the reference translation uses ""keeps a distance,"" which suggests a more nuanced separation, not necessarily complete exclusion.

2. **""Probably"" vs. ""rightly so""**: The reference translation includes the word ""probably,"" which adds a degree of uncertainty or likelihood to the claim that it might be the right thing to do, whereas the machine translation uses ""rightly so"" without this qualification, making the statement sound more definitive.

3. **No comma after ""away""**: The reference translation has a comma after ""away,"" which helps to separate the two clauses and clarify the structure, while the machine translation omits this, making the sentence slightly less clear.

4. **No change in word order**: The source text maintains the same word order as the reference translation, but the machine translation rearranges the phrase ""and küllap õigusega"" to ""and rightly so,"" which slightly alters the meaning and flow.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its choice of words, the degree of certainty, and the sentence structure, which affects the overall meaning and nuance of the sentence. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian text in terms of conveying the intended meaning and tone.

3. Compare the machine translation: ""One day, she will be asked to allow her to receive customers in the New Year.""
4. Identify differences: 
   - ""One day"" is not present in the source, it introduces a time frame that is not specified in the original.
   - ""she will be asked"" is a future tense that is not indicated in the source, which uses present tense.
   - ""to allow her"" is not directly translated from ""luba Annemailt"", the subject and object are switched, making it unclear who is giving permission.
   - ""at Uuevariku"" is missing, which is important context for the location.

5. Compare to the reference translation: ""Ülu asks Annemai for a permission to receive customers at Uuevariku.""

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Ludwig Wittgensteini järgijad kalduvad uskuma, et inimeste õppimine nii käibki.
Machine translation: Ludwig Wittgenstein's followers tend to believe that this is the way people learn.

Step 2: Identify differences in word order and structure.
- In the source text, ""Ludwig Wittgensteini järgijad"" (Ludwig Wittgenstein's followers) is the subject, followed by ""kalduvad uskuma"" (tend to believe), and then ""et inimeste õppimine nii käibki"" (that this is the way people learn).
- The machine translation has the same subject and verb (""Ludwig Wittgenstein's followers tend to believe""), but the phrase ""that this is the way people learn"" is placed at the end, which is different from the source text's structure.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the difference on meaning.
- The difference in structure does not significantly alter the meaning, as both convey the idea that followers of Ludwig Wittgenstein have a belief about how people learn.

Step 4: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Ludwig Wittgenstein 's followers tend to believe that this is the way people learn.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with the main difference being the structure of the sentence. The meaning remains consistent between the machine and reference translations. The only change needed is to place ""that this is the way people learn"" at the end, as in the reference translation, to match the source text's structure more closely. Overall, the quality of the translation is good, but there is room for minor improvement in terms of sentence arrangement.

|Source: Valitsusväed tõrjusid mässulised tagasi, mässuliste positsioonidele linnast väljas anti ka umbes 30 õhulööki.|
|Machine translation: The government forces rejected the rebels, and the rebel positions outside the city were also given around 30 dinner.|
|Reference translation: Government forces repulsed the rebels, and rebel positions outside the city were given about 30 air strikes.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""mässulised tagasi"" (rebels) in the context of being repelled, which is translated as ""rebels"" in both the machine and reference translations.
2. The verb ""tõrjusid"" (rejected) is translated correctly as ""repulsed"" in the reference translation.
3. The phrase ""mässuliste positsioonidele"" (to the rebel positions) is translated as ""the rebel positions"" in both translations.
4. The key difference lies in the translation of ""ka umbes 30 õhulööki"" (also given about 30 air strikes). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""also given around 30 dinner,"" which does not make sense in the context of a military situation.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the part where it incorrectly translates ""õhulööki"" (air strikes) as ""dinner."" The correct translation should reflect the military context, which is ""air strikes"" as in the reference translation.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Margna tahab oma naisega abielluda ja kingib Marele reisi Marokosse.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Margna wants to marry her wife and brings Marek's trip to Morocco to life.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Margna wants to get married to his girlfriend and gifts Mare a trip to Morocco.

Step 4: Compare the subject and verb in the source and machine translation
- Source: Margna tahab (Margna wants)
- Machine: Margna wants to marry her wife (correct subject, but verb ""to marry"" is different from ""to get married"" in the reference)

Step 5: Compare the object and relationship in the source and machine translation
- Source: oma naisega abielluda (to her wife)
- Machine: marry her wife (implies a possessive relationship, but the reference uses ""girlfriend"" instead)

Step 6: Compare the second part of the sentence
- Source: kingib Marele reisi Marokosse (brings Marele's trip to Morocco)
- Machine: brings Marek's trip to Morocco to life (implies a more active event than the reference, which simply states ""gifts"")

Step 7: Compare the final part of the sentence
- Reference: gifts Mare a trip to Morocco (correct verb and object)
- Machine: brings Marek's trip to life (implies a different action)

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
1. The verb ""to marry"" is translated as ""to get married"" in the reference, which is more accurate in terms of the relationship.
2. The source mentions ""naisega"" (to her wife), while the machine translation implies a possessive relationship with ""her wife."" The reference uses ""girlfriend,"" which is a more suitable term for the context.
3. The machine translation adds the phrase ""to life,"" which is not present in the reference and changes the meaning slightly.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should be revised to: ""Margna wants to get married to his girlfriend and gives Mare a trip to Morocco.""

1. **Word choice**: The machine translation uses ""feeling"" (tung) while the reference translation uses ""impulse"" (impulss). The choice of ""impulse"" is more suitable here as it refers to the mental or emotional response, which is a more accurate translation of the Estonian context.

2. **Sentence structure**: The reference translation maintains the structure ""this [noun] does not mean that something else is true,"" which is clearer and more faithful to the original Estonian meaning. The machine translation, on the other hand, omits the ""that something else"" part, making the sentence less precise.

3. **Meaning**: The reference translation captures the idea that the Estonian sentence is about a certain mental state or reaction (impulse) not implying the truth of something else. The machine translation, by translating ""tõsi"" (truth) as ""the truth,"" loses the nuance of the original, which might be a more general concept.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of word choice, sentence structure, and the preservation of the original meaning. The reference translation is a more accurate and faithful representation of the Estonian text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: See ei ole ka lihtsalt enesemääramise võime, kaalutletud teo võime ega iseendale antud põhjenditele tugineva teo võime.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: It is not just self-determination, it is not a considered capacity for action, it is not a self-determination, it is not a self-defeating act.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: It is not just self-determination, the capacity for considered action nor the ability to act based on reasons given to oneself.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation has a repetition of ""it is not a self-determination"" which is not present in the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""self-defeating act"" which is not directly equivalent to the Estonian phrase ""iseendale antud põhjenditele tugineva teo"" (action based on reasons given to oneself).
- The reference translation captures the idea of ""kaalutletud teo"" (considered action) more accurately than the machine translation.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation omits the conjunction ""ega"" (nor) which is important for the parallel structure in the original sentence.
- The machine translation does not convey the concept of ""iseendale antud põhjenditele"" as effectively as the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of repetition, the loss of the conjunction ""ega"" for parallelism, and the less precise translation of the phrase ""iseendale antud põhjenditele tugineva teo"".

Source: Ta katsetas muu hulgas söe, saepuru, tellisepuru ja müüriseguga.
Machine translation: It tested, among other things, coal, sails, bricks and sales.

Step 2: Identify key differences.
- ""söe"" (food) is translated as ""coal"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect.
- ""saepuru"" (sawdust) is not translated at all in the machine translation.
- ""tellisepuru"" (brick rubble) is translated as ""bricks"" in the machine translation, but it's not specific enough to convey the rubble part.
- ""müüriseguga"" (mortar) is translated as ""sales"" in the machine translation, which is a completely unrelated term.

Step 3: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
Reference translation: He experimented, among other things, with coal, sawdust, brick rubble, and mortar.

- The reference translation correctly identifies ""tellisepuru"" as ""brick rubble"" and ""müüriseguga"" as ""mortar.""

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of accuracy and context.

The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly identical, with only a minor difference in punctuation. The source text ends with a period, while the machine and reference translations both include a comma after ""Chile"" and a space before the closing parenthesis. This difference in punctuation does not significantly alter the meaning, but it is a stylistic choice.

The main content, which is the declaration of a state of emergency due to forest fires and the evacuation of thousands of people, is accurately translated by the machine. The subject (""Tšiilis"" or ""Chile""), the action (declaring a state of emergency), and the consequences (evacuating people) are all preserved in the machine translation.

In conclusion, the quality of the machine translation is high, with the main information being accurately conveyed, but there is a minor punctuation inconsistency that could be improved for a more natural-sounding English sentence.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Selle pearivaal Nikaia jäi mongolite retkedest kõrvale ja kogus jõudu Balkani poolsaarel.""
- Machine translation: ""Its main rival, Nicia, stayed out of the shapes of mongos and gained strength on the Balkans peninsula.""

Difference 1: The source text mentions ""mongolite retkedest"" (Mongol invasions), while the machine translation says ""shapes of mongos,"" which is a literal mistranslation.

Difference 2: The source text uses ""kõrvale"" (aside), which implies that Nicia was not directly involved in the Mongol attacks, while the machine translation says ""stayed out,"" which is a similar but not identical concept.

Difference 3: The source text uses ""jõudu kogus"" (gained strength), while the machine translation directly translates this as ""gained strength,"" which is accurate.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""Its main rival, Nicia, stayed out of the shapes of mongos and gained strength on the Balkans peninsula.""
- Reference translation: ""Its main rival, Nicea, was not affected by the Mongol incursions and gained strength on the Balkan peninsula.""

Difference 4: The reference translation correctly translates ""mongolite retkedest"" as ""was not affected by the Mongol incursions,"" which is a more accurate and idiomatic expression.

|Machine translation: There is also poaching, including the killing of rare animals for feed or the sale of ski.|
|Reference translation: There is also poaching , including the killing of rare animals for food or for sale as souvenirs.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""söögiks"" (for food), which is translated as ""feed"" in the machine translation. This is a misinterpretation, as ""söökiks"" specifically refers to the act of killing animals for the purpose of consumption, not as a general source of food.
2. The machine translation has ""ski"" instead of ""suveniirina"" (as souvenirs). This is a direct mistranslation, as ""suveniirina"" is the genitive form of ""suveniir"" (souvenir), indicating that the animals are being killed for sale as items to be kept as souvenirs, not for skiing.
3. The structure of the sentence is slightly different in the machine translation, with ""the sale of ski"" instead of ""for sale as souvenirs."" This is a less significant issue but still affects the clarity of the meaning, as the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural in English.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the meaning of ""söögiks"" and the incorrect translation of ""suveniirina.""

Step 1: Identify the subject in the source text
Source: Võimendaja (amplifier)
Machine translation: The client
Reference translation: The amplifier

Step 2: Compare the subject
The machine translation incorrectly identifies the subject as ""The client"" instead of ""Võimendaja"" (amplifier), which is the main focus of the sentence.

Step 3: Analyze the verb and action
Source: teeb (makes)
Machine translation: makes
Reference translation: makes

The verb ""teeb"" (makes) is correctly translated in both machine and reference translations.

Step 4: Compare the description
Source: taustatingimus (background condition)
Machine translation: a background condition
Reference translation: a background condition

Both translations capture the meaning of ""taustatingimus"" as a ""background condition.""

Step 5: Compare the additional information
Source: mida see muidu oleks (than it would otherwise be)
Machine translation: stronger than it would otherwise be
Reference translation: stronger than it would otherwise be

The phrase ""mida see muidu oleks"" is translated as ""stronger than it would otherwise be"" in both machine and reference translations, which conveys the intended comparison.

Step 6: Conclusion
The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the incorrect identification of the subject ""Võimendaja"" as ""The client."" If we correct this, the machine translation would read: ""The amplifier is a background condition that makes a favourable reason stronger than it would otherwise be."" This would align more closely with the reference translation.

The reference translation is ""All solid balls of pure gold weigh under 100 000 kg,"" which is a more accurate and faithful translation to the source text. It maintains the concept of ""solid balls"" and specifies that they are made of ""pure gold.""

Step 4: Identify the issues
The machine translation mistakes the context, translating ""tahked"" (balls) as ""tales"" and does not clarify that the gold is in the form of physical objects. The reference translation, on the other hand, correctly conveys the meaning.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is of lower quality due to the incorrect interpretation of ""tahked"" as ""tales"" and the lack of clarity about the physical nature of the gold. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Viimasest viiest mängust kaotas Euwe neli ja suutis viigistada vaid ühe.
Machine translation: Of the last five, Euwe lost four, only one was able to fuss.

Step 2: Identify differences in meaning.
- ""kaotas"" (lost) in the source is translated as ""lost"" in the machine translation, which is accurate.
- ""suutis viigistada"" (was able to draw) in the source is translated as ""was only able to fuss"" in the machine translation. This is not an exact match, as ""fuss"" does not convey the same meaning as ""viigistada"" (to draw a tie) in the context of a chess game.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Of the last five games, Euwe lost four, and was only able to tie one.

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The machine translation omits the word ""games"" from the source, which is important for clarity.
- The reference translation correctly uses ""tie"" (or ""viigistada"" in Estonian) to describe the outcome, while the machine translation uses ""fuss,"" which is not an accurate term.

Conclusion: The machine translation has differences in terms of accuracy and clarity compared to the reference translation. It misses the word ""games"" and uses an incorrect term (""fuss"") to describe the result, which should be ""viigistada"" or ""tie."" The correct translation would be: ""Of the last five games, Euwe lost four, and was only able to tie one.""

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Identify key phrases and words in the source text
- Samal päeval (on the same day)
- tõmmati välja (withdrawn)
- Vaivara vanalt kalmistult (from the old cemetery of Vaivara)
- täiendust saanud (upgraded)
- 47. rügemendi I. pataljon (1st Battalion of the 47th Regiment)
- suunati rindele Krivasoosse (sent to Krivasoo)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""On the same day, 47th embryonic element I. pataljon was also thrown out in an old calibre from the ground and put on the front in crisis.""
- Reference translation: ""On the same day, the 1st Battalion of the 47th Regiment, which had been upgraded, was withdrawn from the old cemetery of Vaivara and sent to Krivasoo.""

Differences:
- ""embryonic element"" is a mistranslation, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of ""täiendust saanud"" (upgraded).
- ""thrown out in an old calibre"" is not present in the reference translation, which uses ""withdrawn"" instead.
- ""put on the front in crisis"" is not found in the reference, it seems to be a misinterpretation of the original text, which simply states the battalion was sent to Krivasoo.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation has several inaccuracies, including the incorrect translation of ""täiendust saanud"" and the addition of elements not present in the source text, such as ""embryonic element"" and ""put on the front in crisis."" The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text by using ""upgraded"" and ""withdrawn"" and maintaining the context of the event.

1. **Subject**: The source text refers to ""Läänemaalased"" (Estonian people), while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""The West"". The reference translation correctly identifies the subject as ""The Läänemaa people"".
2. **Action**: The verb ""ründasid"" (attacked) is not translated accurately in the machine translation, which uses ""was attacked"". The reference translation captures the correct verb ""attacked"" in English.
3. **Object**: The source mentions ""kolme üksteisele järgnenud sõjaväega"" (three successive armies), which is not translated as a single phrase in the machine translation. Instead, it is split into ""three consecutive armies"". The reference translation conveys this idea more clearly by saying ""with three successive armies"".
4. **Location**: The source specifies ""Metsepole ja Lēdurga liivlasi"" (Livonians from Metsepole and Lēdurga), which is translated as ""Metseo and Lēdurga"" in the machine translation, losing the context of the Livonians. The reference translation correctly includes ""the Livonians of Metsepole and Lēdurga"".

|Reference translation: From the point of view of the realisation of the necessary elements of an offence, it does not matter for what purpose the material with prohibited content was produced, stored or made available.|

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""Süüteokoosseisu realiseerumise aspektist"" which refers to the aspect of realizing the elements of a crime. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the reorganisation of the offence"", which is not the same concept. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning as ""the realisation of the necessary elements of an offence"".
2. The source text mentions ""keelatud sisuga materjali"" (prohibited content material), while the machine translation omits this detail, simply stating ""material"". The reference translation includes ""material with prohibited content"", which is more accurate.
3. The source text uses ""valmistatud, hoitud või kättesaadavaks tehtud"" to describe the actions of producing, storing, or making available. The machine translation translates this as ""to produce, store or make available material"", but the reference translation keeps the same structure and adds ""for what purpose"", which is crucial for understanding the context.

In summary, the machine translation loses the specific aspect of realizing the elements of a crime and omits the detail about prohibited content. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start| Step 1: Compare the sentence structure and grammar|
The source text starts with ""Selle auks peab märkima,"" which translates to ""It should be noted"" in the reference translation. The machine translation also has ""It should be noted,"" which is consistent.

Next, the source text has ""et just selline inimloomuse kujund inspireeris poliitilist liberalismi,"" while the reference translation has ""in its honour that it was this image of human nature that inspired political liberalism."" The machine translation omits the phrase ""in its honour"" and changes the word order slightly.

|im_end| Step 2: Analyze the differences|
The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the inclusion of ""in its honour"" in the reference, which adds emphasis on the reason for noting the connection. The machine translation omits this phrase, making the sentence less clear about the context.

Additionally, the word order in the machine translation is slightly different, with ""that it was"" coming after ""inspired,"" while in the reference, it is placed after ""human nature."" This change affects the flow of the sentence and the clarity of the cause-effect relationship.

|im_end| Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the emphasis on the reason for noting the connection (""in its honour"") and the word order, which affects the clarity of the sentence.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- In the source text, ""ründab selle vastast"" can be translated as ""attacking the opponent"" (referring to someone he is opposing).
- The machine translation, however, translates it as ""attacking the fact that he is not undermining this power"", which changes the meaning slightly, focusing on the act of not weakening the power rather than directly opposing.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- The reference translation correctly captures the idea of ""ründab selle vastast"" as ""attacking the opponent"" and maintains the context of not undermining the power.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in that it incorrectly translates ""ründab selle vastast"" as ""attacking the fact"" instead of ""attacking the opponent"". This results in a less clear and potentially misleading meaning in the English translation. The reference translation better conveys the original Estonian message.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: On oletatud, et kavatseti demonstreerida oma poliitilist huvi selles piirkonnas ja rünnata riialaste väge.
Machine translation: It has been assumed that it was intended to demonstrate its political interest in the region and to attack the banditry forces.

Difference 1: The source text uses ""riialaste väge"" which refers to ""forces from Riga"" or ""gangsters from Riga"" (assuming ""väge"" is a colloquial term for bandits or criminals). The machine translation translates this as ""banditry forces"", which is a more general term and does not specify the origin.

Step 2: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
Reference translation: It has been assumed that they intended to demonstrate their political interest in the region and to attack the forces from Riga.

Difference 2: The reference translation correctly translates ""riialaste väge"" as ""forces from Riga"", which indicates the specific origin of the attackers.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its use of ""banditry forces"" instead of specifying ""forces from Riga"", which loses the geographical context and potentially implies a broader category of criminals rather than a specific group.

5. Compare the verb: ""valmistab"" in the source means ""prepares"" in Estonian. The machine translation uses ""is preparing,"" which is the present continuous tense, while the reference uses ""prepares,"" which is in the simple present tense. The simple present tense is more suitable for this context, as it describes a general action.
6. Compare the object: ""ette maavägede ohvitserkonda"" refers to a specific type of officer, ""land-force officer"" in the machine translation and ""the Army officers"" in the reference. The machine translation is more specific, mentioning ""land-force,"" while the reference omits this detail but still conveys the same meaning.
7.

However, it is more specific about the type of officer (land-force) than the reference translation, which might lead to a slightly different interpretation. The reference translation is clearer and more concise, but the machine translation is not incorrect. The main difference lies in the level of detail provided about the officer type.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Linnapea kohusetäitjaks nimetati abilinnapea Rafael Amos.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The head of city has been appointed deputy director of the aid city at Rafah Amos.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Rafael Amos, Vice Mayor, was appointed as the Acting Mayor.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- In the source, ""Linnapea kohusetäitjaks"" means ""as the acting mayor"" or ""to serve as the city mayor's assistant.""
- ""Nimetati"" means ""was appointed.""
- ""Abilinnapea"" refers to ""deputy mayor"" or ""assistant city mayor.""
- ""Rafael Amos"" is the name of the person.

Machine translation:
- Incorrectly translates ""kohusetäitjaks"" as ""deputy director of the aid city,"" which is not the same as ""acting mayor"" or ""city mayor's assistant.""
- Omits the title ""Vice Mayor"" from Rafael Amos, making the role less clear.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation does not capture the correct meaning of ""kohusetäitjaks"" and does not include the title ""Vice Mayor.""
- The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the role description (misinterpreting ""kohusetäitjaks"" as ""deputy director"") and the inclusion of the title ""Vice Mayor."" The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian text.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Ahvatlev on öelda, et nad ei teadnud alternatiividest ja pidasid oma ühiskonnakorda paratamatuks.
Machine translation: It is tempting to say that they did not know the alternatives and considered their social order to be inevitable.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- The source text uses ""Ahvatlev on öelda"" (Ahvatlev said), which is a direct quote or attribution. The machine translation omits this attribution, making it unclear who is making the statement.
- The source text has ""pidasid oma ühiskonnakorda paratamatuks"" (considered their social order to be inevitable), which is a direct translation of the idea. The machine translation also conveys this idea but omits the word ""paratamatuks,"" which might be translated as ""unavoidable"" or ""inevitable"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- The reference translation is identical to the machine translation, except for the attribution, which is missing in both.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it lacks the attribution ""Ahvatlev on öelda,"" which is crucial for understanding the context. The main idea of considering the social order as inevitable is preserved, but the word ""paratamatuks"" is not included in the machine translation, which might slightly affect the connotation of inevitability. Overall, the translation is accurate in terms of meaning but could be improved with the attribution and a more precise translation of ""paratamatuks.""

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Mornasse on saabunud üks meesterahvas, kes otsib Almat.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: One male people has arrived in Moravia seeking Alma.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: A man has come to Morna seeking Alma.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""Mornasse"" (which seems to be a misspelling or a different name, possibly ""Morna""), while the machine translation uses ""Moravia,"" which is a different geographical location.
- The source text uses ""meesterahvas,"" which is a compound word that could mean ""master craftsman"" or ""master person"" in Estonian, but the machine translation translates it as ""male people,"" which is a less specific and potentially incorrect interpretation.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""meesterahvas"" as ""a man.""

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation incorrectly places the location as ""Moravia"" instead of ""Morna.""
- The reference translation omits the unnecessary ""male"" from ""male people"" and keeps it as ""a man,"" which is more accurate.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the location (""Mornasse"" vs. ""Moravia"") and the more precise gender reference (""meesterahvas"" vs. ""a man""). The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

- Machine translation: ""The resignation of Slipperi further weakened the position of Prime Minister Julia Glarard's minority government.""

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- In the source text, ""nõrgendas veelgi"" (weakened even further) is translated as ""further weakened"" in the machine translation, which conveys the same meaning.
- The name ""Julia Gillardi"" in the source text is translated as ""Julia Glarard"" in the machine translation, which is a typo. The correct name should be ""Julia Gillard"" as in the reference translation.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- The machine translation has the correct structure and meaning, except for the typo in the name ""Julia Glarard.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with the main difference being the correct name ""Julia Gillard"" in the reference translation. The core message about the resignation weakening the minority government is preserved, but the typo in the name reduces the overall quality.

1. ""Varem olid"" (In the past) - The machine translation captures the meaning of ""varem"" (past) but omits the aspect of time, which is present in both the source and reference translations. This is a minor difference.
2. ""koalitsiooni"" (the coalition) - Both translations use the correct term for ""coalition.""
3. ""tunnustanud"" (recognised) - The verb ""tunnustanud"" is translated as ""recognised"" in both, but the word order is slightly different.
4. ""Süüria"" (Syria) - The name is correctly translated in both.
5. ""kõrgeima võimu"" (highest power) - The meaning is preserved, but the word order is different in the machine translation.
6. ""esindajana"" (as a representative) - The machine translation omits this prepositional phrase, which is crucial for conveying the relationship between the coalition and Syria's power.
7. ""mitmed Pärsia lahe piirkonna riigid"" (several Gulf states) - The source specifies ""Pärsia lahe piirkonna"" (Gulf region), which is not included in the machine translation. This is a significant difference, as it provides geographical context.

Overall analysis: The machine translation captures the main idea but loses some details and nuances, particularly the geographical context. The differences in word order and the absence of ""esindajana"" and ""Pärsia lahe piirkonna"" affect the quality of the translation.

- Machine translation: ""In the context of climate tolerance, retrographical movements explained somewhat ad hoc, adding special episodes.""

Difference: The machine translation introduces ""climate tolerance"" which is not present in the source text. The source text is discussing Ptolemy's explanation of retrograde movements, not climate.

Step 2: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
- Source: ""Ptolemaios seletas retrograadseid liikumisi mõnevõrra ad hoc, lisades spetsiaalsed epitsüklid.""
- Reference translation: ""Ptolemy used a somewhat ad hoc explanation for retrograde movements, by adding special epicycles.""

Difference: The reference translation accurately captures the main idea of the source text, mentioning ""ad hoc explanation"" and ""special epicycles"" which are key elements from the source. The difference lies in the reference's use of ""used"" instead of ""seletas"" (explained), but this is a minor difference in verb choice.

|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the names
- Machine translation: Mikhail Asen
- Reference translation: Mikhail Asen I

The difference here is that the reference translation specifies ""I"" after Mikhail Asen's name, indicating that it refers to a specific individual with that title. The machine translation omits this, which might lead to confusion about whether it's referring to a different Mikhail Asen or a specific one.

Step 2: Compare the locations
- Machine translation: Nicaragua
- Reference translation: Nicea

The machine translation uses ""Nicaragua,"" which is incorrect in this context. The reference translation uses ""Nicaia,"" which is likely a historical or geographical name, possibly referring to a region or city, and is more consistent with the source text.

Step 3: Compare the rest of the sentence
- Both translations convey the idea that Mikhail Asen's indecision led to the exception of Tsepina, with the lost territory being regained.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in two main ways: it omits the ""I"" after Mikhail Asen's name, potentially causing confusion about the individual, and it mistakenly translates ""Nikaial"" as ""Nicaragua,"" which is not accurate. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text in terms of specifying ""I"" and using the correct historical name ""Nicaia.""

1. The source text mentions ""ajalooline mõistemoodustus"" (historical conception of concepts), which the machine translation has translated as ""Historical conception."" The reference translation uses ""Historical formation of concepts,"" which is a more accurate and specific term that includes the idea of concepts being formed over time.
2. The source text compares ""reaalsuse kujutamisele"" (to the depiction of reality) with ""loodusteaduslik"" (natural science-like). The machine translation simply states ""the perception of reality"" instead of specifying ""depiction"" or ""representation."" The reference translation, ""that of natural science,"" clarifies that it's the depiction aspect that is being contrasted.
3. The reference translation adds the word ""formation"" to the beginning, which is crucial for conveying the idea that the process of forming concepts is being compared, not just the subject matter.

Overall analysis:
- The machine translation is less precise in terms of specifying ""formation"" and ""depiction"" compared to the reference.
- The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text's meaning by including the process aspect and specifying ""that of natural science.""

Machine translation: The language narrowly escaped a life; the black hole, including the crown and the cross, fell into the hands of the victorious Bulgarians.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The Emperor narrowly escaped with his life ; the Imperial treasury chest , including the crown and the cross , fell into the hands of the victorious Bulgarians.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- In the source, ""keiser"" (emperor) is translated as ""language"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect.
- ""põgenes napilt eluga"" (barely escaped with his life) is translated as ""narrowly escaped a life"" in the machine translation, which is a less precise but understandable approximation.
- ""keiserlik varalaegas"" (Imperial treasury chest) is translated as ""black hole"" in the machine translation, which is a significant error, as it changes the meaning of the term.
- ""sealhulgas kroon ja rist"" (including the crown and the cross) is translated as ""including the crown and the cross"" in both the machine and reference translations, which is accurate.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly translates ""keiser"" as ""The Emperor"" and keeps the context of the escape with his life.
- It also accurately translates ""keiserlik varalaegas"" as ""Imperial treasury chest,"" which is a crucial part of the sentence.

2. **""pidi maksu""** (had to charge) - Both the machine and reference translations use ""had to charge,"" which conveys the obligation or necessity of the action.

3. **"" oma hõimu liikmetelt""** (on his tribal members) - The machine translation correctly translates this as ""on his tribal members,"" while the reference translation uses ""his tribal members"" without the definite article ""oma."" This is a minor difference, as ""his"" is implied in both translations.

4. **""sisse nõudma""** (to demand) - The machine translation omits this part, which is not present in the English reference translation. The reference might be missing the context or the intended meaning, as ""nõudma"" could imply demanding payment or permission, but without more context, it's difficult to determine if it's a mistake or intentional simplification.

Overall, the machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but there is a slight loss of nuance in the translation of ""sisse nõudma."" The differences are minor and do not significantly affect the overall meaning.

2. **""niisuguse asja""**: The phrase means ""this kind of thing"" in Estonian. The machine translation has ""this kind of thing"" as well, but it uses ""fashionable"" instead of ""modal"" to describe the difference, which is a misinterpretation.
3. **""ja tema seesmse mooduse""**: This part means ""and its internal way of doing it.""

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Epicharmos ütleb ka, inimesed peavad üksteist kõige ilusamateks, nii nagu ka koerad üksteist.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Eminarmos also say, people consider each other to be the most beautiful, just as dogs say each other.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Emicharmos also says that people consider each other to be the most beautiful, just as dogs consider each other.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The source text mentions ""Epicharmos ütleb"" (Epicharmos says), but the machine translation incorrectly translates it to ""Eminarmos also say"" (which is a different name and a wrong verb form).
- The machine translation adds ""dogs say each other"" at the end, which is not present in the source or reference translations. This part is unnecessary and might lead to confusion, as it implies dogs are communicating the same sentiment, which is not the point being made.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The name ""Epicharmos"" is not translated correctly.
- The verb ""ütleb"" (says) is translated to ""say"" without the correct form for the subject ""Eminarmos.""
- The machine translation includes an unnecessary part about dogs communicating, which is not in the source or reference.

Conclusion: The machine translation has differences in terms of the proper name, verb form, and an extra, irrelevant detail. The reference translation is more accurate, maintaining the original meaning and structure of the source text.

|Reference translation: The main environmental problems in Portugal are soil erosion, air pollution caused by industry and vehicles, and water pollution, particularly affecting coastal areas.|

Analysis:
1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same essential information: the main environmental problems in Portugal include soil erosion, air pollution from industry and vehicles, and water pollution, with a focus on coastal areas.
2. The sentence structure and grammar are similar in both versions, with the only difference being the inclusion of a comma after ""areas"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference translation. This comma is optional in English and does not change the meaning significantly.
3. The word ""iseäranis"" in the source text, which means ""specifically"" or ""especially"" in Estonian, is translated as ""particularly"" in both versions, which conveys the same emphasis.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in punctuation.

However, differences in courage do not create a new kind of new kind.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
However, differences in courage do not create a new kind.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation adds the phrase ""new kind of"" after ""new kind,"" which is redundant and not present in the reference translation.
- The source text in Estonian does not mention anything about creating a ""new kind"" twice, so this is an unnecessary addition.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
The main difference is the redundancy in the phrase ""new kind of new kind,"" which is not found in the reference translation. The source text simply states that differences in courage do not create a new kind, without specifying any additional attributes.

Conclusion: The machine translation is less accurate than the reference translation because it introduces unnecessary redundancy. The correct translation should be: ""However, differences in courage do not create a new kind.""

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus I was killed with most of his troops and his skull was used as a drinking utensil.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- In the source, ""Bütsantsi keiser"" refers to ""Byzantine Emperor"" (a historical figure, not ""Buying Emperor"").
- ""Nikephoros I"" is the correct name, but the machine translation has ""Nlingphoros I"" which is a mistranslation.
- ""vägedega"" means ""with his troops"" in Estonian, but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""his yellow"" (which likely refers to a color, not troops).
- ""jooginõuna"" means ""as a drink-war"" in Estonian, but the reference translation correctly translates it as ""drinking utensil.""

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation incorrectly identifies the emperor as ""Buying Emperor"" instead of ""Byzantine Emperor.""
- It also mistranslates ""vägedega"" as ""his yellow"" and ""jooginõuna"" as ""drink-war.""
- The reference translation accurately translates the name ""Nicephorus I"" and the use of the emperor's skull as a drinking utensil.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the correct identification of the emperor, the translation of ""vägedega,"" and the meaning of ""jooginõuna.""

|Machine translation: A number of trade points were built on the African coast in the 15th century, which later turned into colonies.|
|Reference translation: A number of trading posts were established on the African coast in the 15th century, which later turned into colonies.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Aafrika rannikule rajati""** (built on the African coast) - Machine translation: ""A number of trade points were built on the African coast"" - The reference translation uses ""established"", which is a more accurate term for the act of setting up trading posts, rather than ""built"" which implies physical construction.
2. **""15. sajandil""** (in the 15th century) - Both translations use this phrase correctly.
3. **""mitmeid kaubanduspunkte""** (a number of trade points) - Machine translation: ""A number of trade points"" - This is a direct match.
4. **""millest kujunesid hiljem kolooniad""** (which later turned into colonies) - Machine translation: ""which later turned into colonies"" - The meaning is preserved, but the structure is slightly different. The reference translation uses ""which later became"" for a smoother flow.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the choice of words for the establishment of trading posts. The main difference lies in the use of ""built"" instead of ""established"" and the phrasing ""turned into"" versus ""became"".

|im_start| Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Alma rejoices to hear that Allan has improved.

|im_start| Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""Alma rõõmustab"" (Alma rejoices), which is a verb phrase in Estonian.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates this to ""I will start by hearing,"" which is a future action and does not convey the emotion of rejoicing.
- The source text has ""kui kuuleb"" (when she hears), which is a condition, while the machine translation omits this part.
- The source text ""et Allan on ennast parandanud"" (that Allan has improved himself) is translated to ""corrected itself"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate as ""ennast parandanud"" implies personal improvement.

|im_start| Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly captures the verb ""rõõmustab"" (rejoices) and the condition ""kui kuuleb"" (when she hears).
- It also translates ""parandanud"" (improved) accurately, maintaining the context of personal improvement.

Analysis:
1. The machine translation has an error in the word ""sooja"" (meaning ""hot"" or ""temperature"" in Estonian) which is translated as ""salt"" in English. This is a mistranslation, as the context refers to the temperature, not the presence of salt.
2. The reference translation correctly uses ""temperature"" to describe the 47.4 °C value, while the machine translation incorrectly uses ""salt.""
3. The punctuation in the source text is not preserved in the machine translation, as there is no apostrophe in ""summer's"" in the MT, while it should be present according to the reference translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the incorrect translation of ""sooja"" as ""salt"" and the lack of the possessive apostrophe in ""summer's.""

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Ta peab silmas, et teo väärtus ei ole mingis muus sihis kui kohuses, st mingis soovist või kalduvusest tulevas sihis; mitte et üldse sihti ei oleks.""
- Machine translation: ""He means that the value of the act is not in any other place than the duty, that is to say in any place coming from a desire or a propensity; not at all the target.""

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- The machine translation uses ""not at all the target"" instead of ""mitte et üldse sihti ei oleks"" (which means ""not that there is no purpose at all"").
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""st mingis soovist või kalduvusest tulevas sihis"" (which means ""that is to say, in a purpose coming from a desire or propensity"").

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: ""He means that the value of an act is not in a purpose other than duty , that is to say , in a purpose coming from a desire or propensity ; not that there is no purpose at all .""

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation is missing the clarification that the value is not in a purpose other than duty, which is provided in the reference translation with ""other than duty.""
- The reference translation includes the phrase ""coming from a desire or propensity,"" which is not present in the machine translation, but is important to convey the full meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the exclusion of the phrase ""other than duty"" and the inclusion of the detail about the purpose coming from a desire or propensity. The machine translation is less precise and misses some nuances in the original Estonian text.

Step 1: Compare the subject and main action
- Source: Käsundiandja (mandator)
- Machine translation: The facilitator
- Reference translation: The mandator

The subject is different: ""Käsundiandja"" in Estonian refers to a ""mandator"" or ""party responsible for providing the service,"" while ""facilitator"" in the machine translation is a broader term that could also include someone assisting in a process, not necessarily the party responsible for payment.

Step 2: Compare the object and related action
- Source: tasu (fee)
- Machine translation: fee
- Reference translation: a fee

Both ""tasu"" and ""fee"" are translated correctly, but the reference translation adds ""the amount of which"" to clarify the relationship between the fee and the agreement.

Step 3: Compare the context of agreement
- Source: tavaliselt lepingus kokku lepivad (usually agreed in the agreement)
- Machine translation: the size of which is usually agreed by the parties to the agreement
- Reference translation: usually agreed in the contract between the parties

The meaning is similar, but the reference translation uses ""contract"" instead of ""agreement"" for a more specific term, and the structure is slightly different.

Conclusion:
The machine translation captures the main idea but has a few differences in terms of subject and context. It would be more accurate if it translated ""Käsundiandja"" as ""mandator"" and used ""contract"" instead of ""agreement."" The reference translation provides a clearer and more precise translation, especially with the addition of ""the amount of which.""

1. **Sentence structure**: Both the machine translation and the reference translation maintain the same sentence structure, which is a straightforward statement about the existence of two possible approaches to the value of human beings.

2. **Word-for-word translation**: The words ""väärtuse"" (value), ""kohta"" (about), ""on"" (are), ""võimalikud"" (possible), ""kaks"" (two), and ""hoiakut"" (approaches) are accurately translated in the machine translation.

3. **Grammar**: The grammar in both translations is correct, with the subject-verb-object order preserved.

4. **Idiomatic expression**: The phrase ""väärtuse kohta"" (about the value) is directly translated, which is an idiomatic expression in Estonian. The machine translation captures this meaning without altering it.

5. **Punctuation**: Both the machine and reference translations have the same punctuation, which is a period at the end of the sentence.

6. **Comparison**: The only difference between the machine and reference translations is the absence of a space after the period in the machine translation. This is a minor formatting issue and does not affect the meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality, with only a minor formatting difference from the reference translation. The meaning and structure are accurately conveyed, and the key words and phrases are translated correctly.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- In the source text, ""Pasteur näitas"" refers to ""The Pasteur has shown"" (imperfective past tense).
- ""eterve koer"" is translated as ""a whole dog"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate. It should be ""a healthy dog"" as in the reference translation.
- ""kellele oli süstitud marutaudi surnud koera kuivatatud ja purustatud seljaaju"" is translated as ""who had been dried up and destroyed by a dead dog of rabies"", which is a bit awkward. The reference translation is ""who was injected with dried and milled spinal cord of a dog who died of rabies"", which is clearer and more accurate.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- The main difference lies in the description of the experiment. The machine translation incorrectly states that the dog was ""dried up and destroyed"" by the dead dog, while the reference translation specifies that it was the spinal cord of the dead dog that was dried and milled, and then injected into the healthy dog.

Conclusion:
The machine translation has several inaccuracies, particularly in the description of the experiment. It incorrectly translates ""surnud koera kuivatatud ja purustatud seljaaju"" as ""dried up and destroyed by a dead dog of rabies"" instead of specifying that it was the spinal cord that was used.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Selle põhjuseks võis olla kogenematus kahe kahuritekiga laevade ehitamisel või kava laevale hiljem veel võimsam relvastus paigutada.""
- Machine translation: ""This may be due to the impenetration of vessels with two cannon-personnel or to the more powerful introduction of a plan for a ship later on.""

Difference 1: ""kogenematus"" (inexperience) is translated as ""impenetration"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate. The source text refers to a lack of experience, not the inability to penetrate.

Difference 2: ""kahuritekiga"" (with two cannon decks) is translated as ""with two cannon-personnel"" in the machine translation, which is a less precise term. The source text specifically mentions the two decks, not the personnel.

Difference 3: ""võimsam relvastus paigutada"" (to place even more powerful weapons) is translated as ""the more powerful introduction of a plan for a ship"" in the machine translation. While the idea of a more powerful weapon system is present, the translation is not clear and omits the context of placing it on the ship.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""This may be due to the impenetration of vessels with two cannon-personnel or to the more powerful introduction of a plan for a ship later on.""
- Reference translation: ""This may have been due to inexperience in building ships with two cannon decks or a plan to place even more powerful weapons on board later.""

Difference 4: The reference translation uses ""inexperience in building ships"" instead of ""impenetration,"" which is a more accurate representation of the source text.

Difference 5: The reference translation keeps the concept of ""two cannon decks"" as ""two cannon decks,"" making it clearer.

Difference 6: The reference translation ""a plan to place even more powerful weapons on board later"" is a clearer and more direct translation of the source's ""võimsam relvastus paigutada hiljem.""

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the areas of accurately conveying the lack of experience and the specific details about the two cannon decks and the plan for more powerful weapons. The reference translation provides a more faithful and clear representation of the source text.

1. **Source**: The source text mentions ""Alfons Rebane tegi Wagnerile ettepaneku"" (Alfons Rebane made a proposal to Wagner), which is correctly translated as ""Alfons Rebane proposed to Wagner"" in both the machine translation and the reference translation.

2. **Location**: The source specifies that the fight group should ""liinus mööda Emajõe kallast"" (move along the bank of Emajõgi), which is translated as ""move on to the city's shores"" in the machine translation. The reference translation captures this as ""along the bank of Emajõgi"", which is more precise and maintains the original meaning.

3. **Action**: The source describes the purpose of the movement as ""piirates sillapea sisse"" (surrounding the bridgehead), which is translated as ""restricting the bridge's head"" in the machine translation. The reference translation, ""surrounding the bridgehead"", is a better translation, as it conveys the idea of encircling the strategic point.

4. **Verb tense**: The source uses the conditional past tense ""oleks"" (would be), which is not explicitly indicated in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly uses ""would have moved"" to express the same future conditional idea.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of precision and clarity. The reference translation better captures the original meaning by specifying the riverbank and the action of surrounding the bridgehead, while the machine translation uses a less precise term and omits the future conditional aspect.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: pisivasakulMahleri teine loomingumajake [[Klagenfurti lähedal Maierniggis, Wörthersee kaldal

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Second Livestock of the Power Left Mahler [near Klagenfurt in Maiernigg, Wörtheras on the side of Maiernigg

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: pisivasakulMahler 's second creative cabin near [ [ Klagenfurt in Maiernigg , on the shore of Wörthersee

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation seems to have a misunderstanding, as it translates ""pisivasakulMahleri"" (which likely refers to a person's name or a place) as ""Second Livestock of the Power Left Mahler,"" which is a nonsensical phrase.
- The machine translation also incorrectly translates ""lähedal"" (near) as ""on the side of Maiernigg,"" which is not accurate. It should be translated as ""near"" or ""close to.""
- The reference translation correctly identifies the location as a ""creative cabin"" (loomingumajake) and specifies that it is near Klagenfurt, Maiernigg, and the shore of Wörthersee.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of accuracy and meaning. It misinterprets the source text and provides a nonsensical phrase instead of a clear and coherent translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, accurately conveys the location of the cabin.

|Machine translation: In Chittagoni, Bangladesh, there was an explosion on a naval base which caused serious injuries to 6 navies.|
|Reference translation: In Chittagong, Bangladesh, there was an explosion on a naval base which caused serious injuries to 6 marines.|

1. **Translation of location**: The source text mentions ""Chittagongis"" (implying Chittagong in the context), which is a misspelling or incorrect word choice in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly uses ""Chittagong"".

2. **Translation of subject**: The source uses ""mereväebaasis plahvatus"" (naval base explosion), which is translated to ""naval base"" in both the machine and reference translations. However, the machine translation incorrectly refers to the injured individuals as ""navies"" instead of ""marines"" as in the reference.

3. **Translation of injured personnel**: The source mentions ""6 mereväelast"" (6 naval personnel), which should be translated to ""6 marines"" in English, as marines are typically the naval infantry. The machine translation incorrectly uses ""navies"" instead.

4. **Grammar and structure**: The structure of the sentence is generally similar in both translations, but the word choice and the incorrect use of ""navies"" in the machine translation affect the meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation has differences in terms of the correct location term (""Chittagongis"" vs. ""Chittagong"") and the identification of the injured personnel as ""navies"" instead of ""marines"". These differences result in a less accurate translation compared to the reference translation.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Need vähesed, mis seda tegid, lakkasid varsti andmast uusi probleeme ja muutusid inseneride töövahendiks.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The few that did so soon ceased to give up new problems and became a tool for engineers.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The few that did so soon ceased to generate new problems and became a tool for engineers.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""give up"" (cease to give up), which is not the most accurate term in this context. The reference translation uses ""generate"" (cease to generate), which better conveys the idea of creating or causing problems.
- The machine translation omits the word ""and"" between ""ceased to give up new problems"" and ""became a tool for engineers,"" which is a minor difference but affects the flow of the sentence.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The main difference lies in the verb choice for ""new problems,"" where the machine translation uses ""give up"" and the reference translation uses ""generate.""
- The machine translation also omits the conjunction ""and,"" which slightly changes the sentence structure.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of verb choice (generate vs. give up) and sentence structure (omission of the conjunction ""and""). The reference translation is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text.

Machine translation: So the question of whether someone is doing their duty depends on the extent to which they are complying with moral law.

The machine translation captures the essence of the source text, maintaining the structure and meaning. The key phrases ""kas keegi täidab oma kohust"" (whether someone is doing their duty) and ""kui tugevasti ta moraaliseadust täidab"" (on the extent to which they are complying with moral law) are accurately translated.

Machine translation: So the question of whether someone is doing their duty depends on the extent to which they are complying with moral law.
Reference translation: So the question of whether someone is doing their duty depends on the extent to which they are complying with moral law.

The reference translation is identical to the machine translation, indicating that there are no differences in meaning or structure.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality and closely matches the reference translation. There are no significant errors or discrepancies that would affect the overall meaning or clarity of the sentence. The translation accurately conveys the source text from Estonian to English.

|Machine translation: The fight against abuses of power, especially in the police and other forces, is ineffective.|
|Reference translation: The fight against abuses of power , especially in the police and other enforcement authorities , is ineffective.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""jõuametkondades"" which refers to ""authorities"" or ""forces"" in a broader sense, including police and other similar institutions. The machine translation translates this as ""forces,"" which is a common but less precise term.
2. The reference translation adds a comma after ""power"" to clarify that ""other"" is referring to ""enforcement authorities,"" making the context more specific.
3. The machine translation omits the comma, which results in a slightly less clear meaning, as it could be interpreted as ""other forces"" without the additional context.

Overall, the main difference lies in the precision of the term ""forces"" versus ""enforcement authorities,"" which affects the clarity of the reference to the specific context of law enforcement. The machine translation is less precise in this regard, but the meaning is still generally understandable.

|Analysis:|
1. **""Vaeste inimeste suur osakaal""** (High percentage of poor people) - Both machine and reference translations capture this concept correctly.
2. **""madal haridustase""** (low levels of education) - Machine translation: ""low levels of education"" - Reference translation: ""low levels of education"" - Both are identical.
3. **""juriidilise süsteemi ja võimu nõrkus""** (weakness of the legal system and power) - Machine translation: ""the weakness of the legal system and power"" - Reference translation: ""the weakness of the legal system and government"" - The machine translation omits ""government"" which is present in the reference translation.

1. **Source**: The source text mentions ""teadus saab moraali mõnes asjas juhendada"" (science can guide morals) and ""selle suunda muuta"" (change its direction).
2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""juhendada"" as ""dictate"" and omits the concept of ""direction"" in the second part, saying ""it cannot add value"" instead of ""it cannot accommodate morals.""
3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation accurately conveys the idea of guiding morals and the inability to accommodate them, which is crucial for understanding the context.

The main differences are:
- The machine translation misses the nuance of ""juhendada"" (guide) and replaces it with ""dictate,"" which is not as precise.
- The machine translation omits the concept of ""direction"" in the moral guidance, focusing on the value aspect instead.
- The reference translation includes ""morals"" and ""consequently, moral philosophy,"" which are important aspects of the original statement.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Nad võisid saarele jääda ainult Jonesi armust; Jones oli hiljuti kaks eurooplasti, kes talle ei meeldinud, avamerele hulpima saatnud.""
- Machine translation: ""They could only stay on the island of Jones, who had recently sent two Europeans who did not like her to the high seas.""

Step 2: Identify differences in meaning or structure.
- The machine translation adds ""the island of"" before ""Jones,"" which is not present in the source text. This might be a minor issue, as the context suggests it's clear that Jones is the island's name.
- The machine translation uses ""who did not like her"" instead of ""kes talle ei meeldinud"" (which means ""whom he did not like"" in English). This changes the subject of the clause, making it sound like the two Europeans didn't like Jones, rather than Jones not liking them.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: ""They could only stay on the island at the mercy of Jones ; Jones had recently sent two Europeans whom he did not like floating on the high seas.""

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation captures the idea of being at Jones' mercy (""at the mercy of Jones"") more accurately than the machine translation, which uses ""on the island of Jones.""
- The reference translation rephrases ""avamerele hulpima saatnud"" as ""floating on the high seas,"" which is a more natural and idiomatic way to express the same idea.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of structure and emphasis. It adds unnecessary words (""the island of"") and changes the subject of the clause, which affects the meaning. The reference translation better conveys the original Estonian text's meaning and maintains a more natural English structure.

1. **Sentence structure**: The source text maintains the same structure in Estonian, with ""osa"" (some) followed by three adjectives describing the categories: ""üleriigilised"" (nationwide), ""regionaalsed"" (regional), and ""suunatud peamiselt välisriikide elanikkonnale"" (mainly targeted at foreign populations). The machine translation also follows a similar structure but omits the space between ""some"" and ""nationwide"" in ""Some of them are nationwide"", which is a minor difference.

2. **Adjectives**: The machine translation accurately captures the meaning of ""üleriigilised"" as ""nationwide"" and ""regionaalsed"" as ""regional"". However, it combines ""suunatud"" (targeted) and ""peamiselt"" (mainly) into ""mainly targeted"", which is a correct but slightly condensed version of the original.

3. **Punctuation**: The source text uses a comma after ""regionaalsed"" to separate it from the next phrase. The machine translation omits this comma, but the reference translation includes it. This is a minor difference that does not affect the overall meaning.

4. **Word order**: The word order in the machine translation is slightly different from the reference, with ""mainly targeted"" coming after ""some regional"". The reference translation places it after ""some"", which is more natural in English. This difference is not significant, as both convey the same meaning.

In conclusion, the machine translation is mostly accurate, with minor differences in punctuation and word order. The main idea is preserved, and the meaning is effectively conveyed. The main difference is the absence of a comma after ""regional"" in the machine translation, which is a stylistic choice but not a major error.

Reference translation: For example, a document or dossier, etc., from the KGB archive would serve as direct evidence.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""the KGB archipelago"" instead of ""a document or dossier"" as in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as the archipelago implies a group of islands, which is not the intended meaning here. The reference translation specifically refers to a document or dossier, which are more relevant to the context of evidence.
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""from the KGB archive"" which is crucial for providing context and clarity about the source of the evidence.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in two main aspects: it incorrectly translates ""document või toimik"" as ""the KGB archipelago"" instead of ""a document or dossier,"" and it omits the phrase ""from the KGB archive"" that provides essential context. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Üle seitsmekümne inimese sai viga, neist viiskümmend kaheksa toimetati haiglatesse.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: More than seventy people were injured, of whom fifty-eight were taken to hospitals.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: More than seventy people were injured, of whom fifty-eight were taken to hospitals.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""seitsmekümne"" (seventy) and ""viiskümmend"" (fifty), which are numbers in Estonian.
- The machine translation correctly translates these numbers as ""more than seventy"" and ""fifty-eight"".
- The source text also mentions ""neist"" (of them), which is a pronoun indicating the relationship between the injured people and those taken to hospitals.
- The machine translation includes this phrase as ""of whom"", which is a correct way to express the relationship in English.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Both translations are identical, except for a possible minor formatting difference (a space before ""of whom"" in the machine translation, which is common in informal text but not a significant issue).

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation only in terms of formatting, with a space before ""of whom"" in the machine translation. The content and meaning are the same, so the quality of the translation can be considered high, given that the main ideas and numbers are accurately conveyed.

|Reference translation: It would be more illuminating to think about the impact of Pedro 's projects on Jim 's decision and not about the impact of Jim projects on Pedro.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to the impact of ""Pedro's projects"" on ""Jimi's decision"" and contrasts it with the idea of not considering the impact of ""Jimi's projects"" on ""Pedro"".
2. In the machine translation, the phrase ""on the paedophiles"" is inserted, which is not present in the source or reference translation. This is an incorrect interpretation and introduces an irrelevant and inappropriate subject.
3. The reference translation accurately maintains the original meaning, keeping the focus on the impact on Jim and not on Pedro.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it incorrectly introduces the term ""paedophiles"" and shifts the focus to an unrelated party, which is not supported by the source text. The reference translation better captures the intended meaning by focusing on the impact on Jim and not Pedro's projects.

|Reference translation:| The meeting focused on the future of the European Union as regards the process of the Constitutional Treaty for Europe, the enlargement of the European Union and cooperation with Russia.

|Analysis:|
1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same essential information: the meeting's focus on the future of the European Union, the Constitutional Treaty process, enlargement, and cooperation with Russia.
2. The structure of the sentence is preserved in both translations, with ""keskenduti"" (focused) and ""menetlemist"" (process) being accurately translated.
3. The phrase ""Euroopa Liidu laienemist"" (enlargement of the European Union) is translated correctly in both versions.
4. The term ""koostööd Venemaaga"" (cooperation with Russia) is also translated accurately.

The only difference between the two translations is the inclusion of the comma after ""Europe"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference translation. This is a minor punctuation difference and does not affect the overall meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality and captures the essence of the source text. The main difference is a minor punctuation issue, which does not significantly alter the meaning. Overall, the translation is accurate and faithful to the original content.|

|Reference translation: In 1920, Robert Rebas's family moved to Narva, where they built a house on Jaama Street.|

1. **Family name difference**: The machine translation uses ""Robert Real"" while the reference translation uses ""Robert Rebas"". This is a difference in the proper name, which should be ""Rebas"" according to the source.

2. **Location difference**: The machine translation mentions ""Narun"" instead of ""Narva"" in the source. This is a geographical error, as ""Narva"" is the correct city name.

3. **Verb tense**: The source uses ""kolis"" (moved) in the past tense, while the machine translation omits the tense. The reference translation correctly uses ""moved"" in the past tense.

4. **Street name**: The source specifies ""Jaama tänavale maja"" (a house on Jaama Street), but the machine translation simply says ""on the streets,"" which is less specific and loses the original detail.

5. **Article**: The reference translation uses the possessive apostrophe for ""Robert Rebas's"" to indicate that the house belongs to his family, while the machine translation omits this, making it less clear.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in proper name, location, verb tense, and specificity of the street name, which affect the overall quality and accuracy of the translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text.

|ref|: Abdution is a deliberation in which we accept a certain proposition as a hypothesis, that is to say we recognise it as a hypothesis.|

|step2| Identify differences between the source and machine translation|
1. ""arutlus"" (source) vs ""deliberation"" (ref): The source uses ""arutlus,"" which refers to a discussion or debate, while the reference uses ""deliberation,"" which is a more formal term for considering and deciding on a matter.
2. ""ehk"" (source) vs ""that is to say"" (ref): The source includes ""ehk,"" which is an Estonian expression that adds emphasis, while the reference uses ""that is to say"" as a direct translation to clarify the meaning.

|step3| Evaluate the impact of these differences on translation quality|
1. The difference in ""arutlus"" vs ""deliberation"" might slightly affect the tone and level of formality, but both convey the idea of a discussion or examination.
2. The use of ""ehk"" is not directly translated, but the reference provides a clear equivalent with ""that is to say,"" which helps clarify the meaning.

|step4| Conclusion|
The machine translation captures the essence of the source text, but with a few adjustments for clarity and style. The main difference is the choice of ""deliberation"" instead of ""arutlus"" and the inclusion of ""that is to say"" to explain the recognition of the proposition as a hypothesis. Overall, the translation is accurate but could benefit from a more direct translation of ""ehk"" or a slight modification to better align with the English context.

Machine translation: The US army convoy in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, caused 7 fatal road accidents.

Difference 1: The source text uses ""Afganistani pealinnas Kabulis"" (in the capital of Afghanistan) while the machine translation combines it into ""Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan,"" losing the prepositional phrase.

Difference 2: The source text uses ""7 surmaga lõppenud liiklusõnnetuse"" (an accident with 7 fatalities) while the machine translation translates it as ""7 fatal road accidents,"" which is a rephrasing but implies multiple accidents instead of one.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: The US army convoy in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, caused 7 fatal road accidents.
Reference translation: A US army convoy in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, caused a road accident with 7 casualties.

Difference 3: The reference translation uses ""a road accident with 7 casualties,"" which is a more concise and accurate representation of the source text's ""7 surmaga lõppenud liiklusõnnetuse.""

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of structure and nuance.

- Machine translation: ""He believes that his value has increased because he has won someone who has, in general, very high values.""

Difference: The machine translation uses ""in general"" to convey the idea of ""üldtunnustatult"" (generally recognized or acknowledged), which is not directly translated but implied. The phrase ""kellel on üldtunnustatult väga kõrge väärtusaste"" is translated as ""who has, in general, very high values.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""He believes that his value has increased because he has won someone who has, in general, very high values.""
- Reference translation: ""He believes that his value has increased because he has won over someone who is generally deemed to have a very high level of value.""

Difference: The reference translation adds the phrase ""is generally deemed to"" to clarify that the high level of value is a perception or evaluation, not an inherent quality of the person. The machine translation omits this part, which might slightly affect the nuance of the sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation captures the main idea but loses some nuance by not explicitly stating that the high value is a perception. The reference translation provides a more precise and idiomatic translation by including the phrase ""is generally deemed to."" Overall, the machine translation is accurate but could be improved by adding the phrase ""is generally deemed to"" for a more accurate representation of the source text.

2. **Machine Translation**: All morals, metaphysics and justice depend on it.
3. **Reference Translation**: All morals, metaphysics and justice depend on it.

**Step 1: Compare the word-for-word translation**
- ""Kogu"" in the source is translated to ""All"" in both machine and reference translations, which is accurate.
- ""moral"" and ""metafüüsika"" are both translated correctly as ""morals"" and ""metaphysics"" in both versions.
- ""ja"" is translated to ""and"" in both, which is correct.
- ""õigus"" is translated to ""justice"" in both, which is accurate.
- ""sõltuvad"" is translated to ""depend"" in both, which is the correct verb for the dependency relationship.
- ""sellest"" is translated to ""on it"" in both, which refers back to an implied subject (although the reference omits the ""it"" for brevity).

**Step 2: Analyze differences**
- The main difference is the inclusion of ""it"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference. The reference omits ""it"" to avoid redundancy, assuming the reader understands the context that ""it"" refers to the subject of the previous sentence or a previously established idea.

**Conclusion:**
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with the main difference being the inclusion of ""it"" in the sentence, which is not present in the reference for the sake of conciseness.

|Reference translation: Despite glaring, but rare exceptions, the natural egoism of the human being seems unquestionable.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Vaatamata"" vs ""Despite""**: The machine translation uses ""erroneous"" instead of ""glaring"" to describe the exceptions. ""Vaatamata"" in Estonian implies a disregard or overlooking of something, while ""glaring"" in English emphasizes the obviousness or prominence of the exceptions. The reference translation captures the idea of exceptions being strikingly evident.
2. **""eranditele"" vs ""exceptions""**: Both translations are accurate here, as ""eranditele"" in Estonian refers to exceptions.
3. **""inimeste loomupärane"" vs ""the natural""**: The machine translation omits the possessive ""loomupärane"" (of people) and simply uses ""the natural,"" which is a reasonable simplification but loses the specific connection to humans.
4. **""egoistlikkus"" vs ""egoism""**: The machine translation uses ""egoism"" as a direct translation, which is correct but loses the genitive form ""egoistlikkus"" in Estonian, which implies the nature of egoism.
5. **""kaheldamatuna"" vs ""unquestionable""**: Both translations convey the same meaning, that the natural egoism is seen as undeniable.

2. **Verbs and action**: The source states ""võitis valimised"" (won the elections), which is translated as ""won the elections"" in the machine translation. The verb and action are accurately conveyed.

3. **Secondary information**: The source adds ""teiseks jäi Rick Santorum"" (secondly, Rick Santorum remained), which is translated as ""secondly, Rick Santorum remained"" in the machine translation. The structure ""with Rick Santorum coming second"" in the reference translation conveys a similar meaning but with a slight difference in phrasing.

4. **Conjunction and structure**: The reference translation uses ""with"" to connect the two pieces of information about Romney's win and Santorum's position, which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it uses ""secondly"" which is a more direct translation but omits the implied connection.

5. **Overall meaning**: The machine translation conveys the main points of the source text, but the reference translation provides a slightly more nuanced and idiomatic English structure, emphasizing the connection between Romney's win and Santorum's second place.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate but loses some of the nuance and flow in the English sentence compared to the reference translation.

   - The machine translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text, using ""Such positions"" as a direct equivalent.
2. ""saab avastada"" -> ""can be detected""
   - The verb ""avastada"" (to discover or recognize) is translated to ""can be detected"" in both the machine and reference translations, which conveys the ability to identify the positions.
3. ""pelga mõtlemisega"" -> ""with just one thought""
   - The source text includes the adverb ""pelga"" (just) and the noun ""mõtlemisega"" (with thinking), which is translated to ""with just one thought"" in the reference translation. The machine translation omits ""just one"" but still conveys the idea of a single thought, so it's not a significant difference.
4. ""sõltumatult"" -> ""independently""
   - The adverb ""sõltumatult"" (independently) is translated correctly to ""independently"" in both versions, maintaining the meaning of not depending on external factors.
5. ""maailmas olemasolevast"" -> ""what exists in the world""
   - The phrase ""maailmas olemasolevast"" is translated to ""what exists in the world"" in both the machine and reference translations, which is a clear and accurate representation of the source's meaning.

Overall analysis: The machine translation is quite accurate, with only minor differences in the choice of words (omitting ""just one"" in ""with just one thought""). The meaning and structure of the sentence are preserved well, and the differences do not significantly affect the quality of the translation. The main difference is the choice of ""with just one thought"" instead of ""with a mere thought,"" which is a stylistic choice but does not alter the meaning.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Identify key phrases and words in the source text
- Keskkooli (secondary school)
- ""kuldne"" (golden)
- lõputunnistus (certificate)
- vabastas (released or exempted)
- sisseastumiseksamitest (entry examinations)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""The average school's 'golden' certificate was released from the entry examinations.""
- Reference translation: ""The 'golden' certificate of the upper secondary school exempted him from admission examinations.""

Difference analysis:
- ""Keskkooli"" is translated as ""average school"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate. It should be ""upper secondary school"" (or ""gymnasium"" in Estonian) to match the reference.
- ""Vabastas"" is translated as ""released"" in the machine translation, but it's more accurately translated as ""exempted"" in the reference, indicating that the person was not required to take the entry exams due to the certificate.
- ""Sisseastumiseksamitest"" is translated as ""entry examinations"" in both, but the reference adds ""him"" (or implied subject) to make it clear who was being exempted.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation has differences in accuracy and specificity compared to the reference translation. It should be improved to better convey the meaning of the source text, such as by translating ""keskkooli"" as ""upper secondary school"" and using ""exempted him"" instead of ""released from.""

|Source: Ta lükkas oma esimese etenduse järgmise aasta jaanuarisse ning kandis siis Wagneri ""Reinikulla"" ja ""Valküüri"" ette ungari keeles.|
|Machine translation: He kicked his first performance in January of next year, and then appealed to the Wagner 'Reinikulla' and 'Valletta' in Hungarian.|
|Reference translation: He postponed his first performance until the January of next year, and then performed Wagner 's ""Rheingold"" and 'Valkyrie' in Hungarian.|

|Analysis|
1. **""lükkas oma esimese etenduse""** (kicked his first performance) - Machine translation: ""He kicked his first performance"" (imprecise, should be ""postponed"")
2. **""järgmise aasta jaanuarisse""** (until the January of next year) - Machine translation: ""in January of next year"" (correct, but lacks the context of postponement)
3. **""siis Wagneri""** (then Wagner's) - Machine translation: ""and then appealed to the Wagner"" (implies a call or request, not the performance of Wagner's works)
4. **""Reinikulla"" ja ""Valküüri""** (Reinikulla and Valküüri) - Machine translation: ""Reinikulla"" and ""Valletta"" (incorrect, ""Reinikulla"" is a character, not a title, and ""Valküüri"" should be ""Valkyrie"")
5. **""ette ungari keeles""** (in Hungarian) - Machine translation: ""in Hungarian"" (correct)

|Conclusion|
The machine translation has several differences from the reference translation. It incorrectly translates ""Reinikulla"" as a title, confuses the character with a place, and does not convey the correct meaning of ""kandis"" (which means ""performed"" in this context). Additionally, it implies an appeal rather than a performance of Wagner's works. The reference translation is more accurate in terms of both content and context.|im_end|

5. Compare with the reference translation: ""One option would also now be to deny that there is a requirement to love at all.""
6. Analysis: The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it incorrectly translates ""armastada"" as ""merge"" and alters the meaning of the sentence, which originally discusses a requirement to love, not merge.

1. Read the source text:
   Source: Õigeusu kirikule oleks antud Katoliku kirikuga võrdsed õigused ja õigeusu piiskopid oleks saanud kohad senatis.

2. Read the machine translation:
   Machine translation: The Orthodox Church would have been given the same rights as the Catholic Church, and Orthodox bishops would have had their seats in the Senate.

3. Read the reference translation:
   Reference translation: The Orthodox Church would have been given the same rights as the Catholic Church, and Orthodox bishops would have had seats in the Senate.

4. Compare the machine translation to the reference translation:
   - Both translations convey the main idea that the Orthodox Church would have received equal rights to the Catholic Church and that Orthodox bishops would have had seats in the Senate.
   - The only difference is the use of ""their seats"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the source text. In Estonian, ""kohad"" can be translated as ""places"" or ""seats"" but does not require an article like ""their"" in English.

5. Analyze the difference:
   The machine translation adds the article ""their"" before ""seats,"" which is not necessary in this context. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian, as it omits the article.

6. Conclusion:
   The machine translation is slightly different from the reference translation due to the unnecessary addition of the article ""their."" The core meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is more accurate in terms of word choice and structure.

|Machine translation: President Saakashvili, through his spokesman, announced that he was not going to meet the Prime Minister's request.|
|Reference translation: President Saakashvili , through his spokesperson , announced that he was not going to accept the Prime Minister 's request .|

Analysis:
1. The source text uses ""nõudmisele vastu tulla"" which means ""to come to the request"" or ""to comply with the request"". The machine translation translates this as ""meet the Prime Minister's request"", which is a close but not exact match. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""accept the Prime Minister's request"", which conveys the same idea of not giving in to the request.

2. The comma after ""pressiesindaja kaudu"" in the source text is not present in the machine translation, but it is included in the reference translation. This comma is not crucial for the meaning but adds a slight pause for clarity in the sentence.

3. The reference translation adds quotation marks around ""Prime Minister's request"" which is not present in the machine translation. This is a stylistic choice in the reference to emphasize the direct quote, but it's not a significant difference in meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but loses a bit of nuance and style compared to the reference translation. The main difference lies in the choice of words to convey ""coming to"" or ""complying with"" the request, which is better expressed in the reference translation as ""accept"".

|Reference translation: While Kristjan and Jürka fraternized at the end of the last year, it is now the turn for their wives, Laine and Leili, to find common ground.|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation uses ""Christians and Jürka"" instead of ""Kristjan ja Jürka,"" which is a direct translation error, as it refers to a different context (assuming ""Christians"" is a misinterpretation of the Estonian names).
2. The phrase ""siis nüüd leiavad üle hulga aja ühise keele"" in the source is translated as ""their women will now also find common ground,"" which is a reasonable attempt but loses the sense of a progression or change of roles from the source. The reference translation captures this with ""it is now the turn for their wives.""
3. The names ""Laine"" and ""Leili"" are correctly translated in both the machine and reference translations.

Overall, the machine translation has issues with the interpretation of the context and the phrasing, which results in a less accurate representation of the source text compared to the reference translation.

|im_start|
The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly in line with each other, with only a minor difference in punctuation. The machine translation uses a comma ("","") after ""meeting,"" while the reference translation omits it. This difference is likely due to the style or preference in punctuation between the two translations, as the meaning conveyed is essentially the same.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. Both translations convey the same information: that ministers approved a relocation scheme for 120,000 refugees.
2. The source text mentions ""kiitsid"" (thanked or approved), which is translated as ""approved"" in both versions.
3. The key phrase ""120 000 põgeniku ümberpaigutamise kava"" (relocation scheme for 120,000 refugees) is accurately translated.
4. The reference to ""Euroopa Komisjoni välja töötatud kvoodid"" (quotas developed by the European Commission) is also preserved in both translations.

The main difference is the comma after ""meeting"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference translation. This does not significantly alter the meaning but may affect the flow or style of the sentence in English. Overall, the machine translation is of good quality, with the main content accurately captured.

|Reference translation: In Kenya, four senior judges were declared unfit for the office by a special committee on the independence of the courts.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text starts with ""Keenias kuulutas"" which means ""In Kenya declared"" in English. The machine translation correctly captures this as ""In Kenya, the independence of the courts was declared"".
2. The source mentions ""kohtute sõltumatust uurinud erikomisjon"" which means ""a special committee investigating the independence of courts"". The machine translation omits this detail, referring to the committee as ""the Special committee"" without specifying its purpose.
3. The source states ""neli kõrgemat kohtunikku"" (four senior judges) and "" ametisse sobimatuks"" (unfit for the office). The machine translation correctly translates these as ""four senior judges"" and ""unfit for the office"", but the word order is slightly different.

|Reference translation: In France , there was a general strike by the aircraft manufacturer Airbus ' workers , to demonstrated against the large-scale redundancies planned by the firm .|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""toimus"" (happened) in the past tense, while the machine translation uses ""was"" which is also in the past tense, but the reference translation omits the verb ""to be"" and uses ""to demonstrated"" instead, which is a bit awkward but still conveys the past action.
2. The source text has ""üldstreik"" (general strike), which is translated as ""general strike"" in both machine and reference translations, so there's no difference here.
3. The source text includes ""meelt firma poolt"" (with the company's consent), which is not directly translated in the machine translation, but the meaning is implied through ""planned by the firm."" The reference translation omits this part, which might lead to a slightly less clear understanding of the context.
4. The source text ends with ""vastu"" (against), which is translated as ""against"" in both machine and reference translations.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation captures the main points of the source text, but it omits some details and has a slightly awkward phrasing in the reference translation. The differences mainly lie in the verb construction and the inclusion of ""with the company's consent"" in the source text.

**Analysis:**
- **Subject**: In the source, the subject is ""Andrew Wotherspoon"" and the role is ""kooliõpetaja"" (school teacher) and ""juhataja"" (head). In the machine translation, the subject is ""a school teacher Andrew Wotherspaon"" and the role is ""chaired"", which is not the same as ""juhataja"" in Estonian.
- **Verb tense**: The source uses the past tense ""sai"" (became) to indicate that Andrew became the post office head. The machine translation uses ""was chaired"", which is a passive construction, but the Estonian verb ""sai"" is not directly translated to English as ""was"" in this context.
- **Order of information**: The source presents the information with the subject (Andrew) first, followed by the role and the fact that he became the first head. The machine translation reverses the order, stating the role first and then the subject.

**Translation quality evaluation:**
- **Accuracy**: The machine translation does not capture the correct verb tense and the role of Andrew Wotherspoon as the head of the post office.
- **Fluency**: The sentence structure in the machine translation is awkward, with ""chaired"" not being the most natural way to express the role in this context.

2. **Machine translation**: The fundamental principles were described in Lakatos as the core of the research programme.
   - The machine translation is slightly different from the reference in the choice of words. ""Kõvaks tuumaks"" (strong core) is translated as ""the core"" without the adjective ""strong"" or ""hard."" Additionally, ""nimetas"" (referred to) is translated as ""were described,"" which is not an exact equivalent.

3. **Reference translation**: Lakatos called the fundamental principles the hard core of the research program.

|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- The source text and machine translation both convey the same information: the growth in industrial production led to population growth, and Podolsk became the city in the Moscow Oblast with the fastest-growing population.
- The structure and meaning are preserved in both translations.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- The machine translation and the reference translation are identical, except for the trailing period at the end of the sentence. The reference translation omits the period, which is a minor difference in punctuation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality and closely aligns with the reference translation, with only a minor punctuation difference. The meaning and content are accurately conveyed, and the structure is similar. The main difference is the absence of a period at the end of the sentence in the reference, which is a stylistic choice rather than a mistake.

**Analysis:**

1. **Source to Machine Translation**: The source text mentions ""temalt ja temale"" (from him and to him), which is translated as ""from him and him"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""from and to him,"" which is more accurate and maintains the intended meaning.

2. **Machine Translation to Reference Translation**: The main difference lies in the phrase ""their direction"" in the machine translation, which is translated as ""their school"" in the reference translation. The reference translation is more contextually appropriate, as ""school"" is more likely to be a metaphorical reference to a philosophical or artistic movement, while ""direction"" could be a broader term that might not convey the same level of specificity.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the choice of ""direction"" versus ""school,"" which affects the level of specificity and the metaphorical meaning conveyed. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian text by using ""predecessor of their school,"" which implies a deeper connection to a specific intellectual or artistic lineage.

|Source: Edward I Toweri laiendamise ajal loodi kolmas müür, kuna kitsas tara ümbritses lossi täielikult.|
|Machine translation: The third wall was created during the different expansion of Edward I, as the narrow fence surrounded the Castle completely.|
|Reference translation: The third wall was created during the Tower expansion by Edward I, as the narrow fence completely surrounded the castle.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Edward I Toweri laiendamise ajal""** (During the expansion of Edward I's Tower) - Machine translation: ""the different expansion of Edward I"" suggests a change or variety in expansion, while the reference translation correctly states ""the Tower expansion by Edward I.""
2. **""kolmas müür""** (the third wall) - Both translations are the same.
3. **""kuna kitsas tara ümbritses lossi täielikult""** (because the narrow fence surrounded the loss completely) - Machine translation: ""the narrow fence surrounded the Castle completely"" is a more direct and clear translation, but it should be ""loss"" instead of ""Castle"" as it refers to the loss or moat, not the castle itself.
4. **""lossi"" vs ""castle""** - The source text refers to ""lossi"" (loss or moat), while the machine translation and reference translation both use ""castle."" The reference translation is more accurate in this context.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation has a minor error in translating ""lossi"" as ""Castle,"" which changes the meaning slightly. The reference translation is more accurate, capturing the intended meaning that the narrow fence surrounded the moat, not the castle itself. The rest of the sentence structure is similar, and the main idea is preserved, but the choice of ""loss"" over ""Castle"" is crucial for the correct translation.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: Romantiline armastus on sõpruse vorm, ja sõprus võib olla sama kirglik ja pühendunud nagu romantiline armastus.
- Machine translation: Roma love is a form of friendship, and friendship can be as passionate and as committed as romantic love.

Difference: The machine translation has changed ""romantiline armastus"" (romantic love) to ""Roma love,"" which is incorrect. The source text specifically refers to romantic love, not a specific type of love called ""Roma.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: Roma love is a form of friendship, and friendship can be as passionate and as committed as romantic love.
- Reference translation: Romantic love is a form of friendship, and friendship can be as passionate and as committed as romantic love.

Difference: The reference translation accurately maintains the term ""romantiline armastus"" (romantic love) as in the source text, while the machine translation mistakenly translates it to ""Roma love.""

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its incorrect handling of the term ""romantiline armastus,"" which should be translated as ""romantic love"" to maintain the meaning and context of the source text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: In the evening, the Ukrainian flag was returned to Kramatorski's administrative building.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In the evening, the Ukrainian flag was hoisted again on Kramatorsk's administrative building.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""returned to"" while the reference translation uses ""hoisted again."" The difference suggests that the machine translation might not capture the action of raising the flag, which is a more common way to describe the event when a flag is displayed.

- The machine translation omits the word ""uuesti,"" which means ""again"" in Estonian. This implies that the context of the flag being raised previously might be lost in the machine translation.

- The word order in the machine translation is slightly different, with ""Kramatorski's administrative building"" following ""returned to,"" while in the reference translation, it is placed after ""hoisted again"" for better flow.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the action description (hoisting vs. returning), the inclusion of the word ""uuesti"" (again), and the word order. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the original Estonian sentence.

|Reference translation: The International Criminal Court issued a warrant for the arrest of Simone Gbagbo, the spouse of the former president of Côte d'Ivoire, Laurent Gbagbo.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""Elevandiluuranniku"" which refers to ""former first lady"" or ""former wife of the president"" in Estonian. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Laurent Gbagbo's husband,"" which is not accurate as it implies a marital relationship between Simone Gbagbo and Laurent Gbagbo, whereas the reference translation correctly identifies Simone as the spouse.
2. The source specifies ""endise presidenti Laurent Gbagbo abikaasa"" which means ""former president Laurent Gbagbo's associate"" or ""former wife"" in Estonian. The machine translation omits this context, making it unclear that Simone Gbagbo is the former first lady, while the reference translation includes this information.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""Elevandiluuranniku"" and the lack of context about Simone Gbagbo being the former first lady, rather than just the husband of Laurent Gbagbo. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

|Machine translation: Before eating, they wash their hands in the common roof, because they are cooked with their hands.|
|Reference translation: Before eating , they wash their hands in a shared bowl , because Nsima is eaten with hands .|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""ühises kausikeses käsi"" (common bowl), which is translated as ""common roof"" in the machine translation. This is a misunderstanding, as the Estonian phrase is about a bowl, not a roof.
2. The machine translation incorrectly assumes that the hands are cooked, which is not the case in the source text. The correct meaning is that Nsima is eaten with hands.
3. The phrase ""nsima't süüakse käega"" (Nsima is eaten with hands) is not translated accurately in the machine translation, as it is missing the connection to the act of eating with hands.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the incorrect interpretation of the ""kausikeses käsi"" as a roof and the incorrect assumption that the hands are cooked. The translation should be revised to: ""Before eating, they wash their hands in a shared bowl, because Nsima is eaten with hands.""

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Linnavõrgustik Teises Bulgaaria tsaaririigis kasvas 13. ja 14. sajandil; esile kerkis arvukalt uusi linnakeskusi.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Urban networks in another Bulgarian federal state grew in the 13th and 14th centuries, and numerous new city centres emerged.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The network of cities in the Second Bulgarian Empire grew in the 13th and 14th centuries, and numerous new city centres emerged.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation adds ""urban networks"" which is not directly present in the source text. The source text refers to ""linnavõrgustik"" (city network), which is a more specific term.
- The machine translation omits ""Teises Bulgaaria tsaaririigis"" (in the Second Bulgarian Empire), which is crucial for context. The reference translation includes this phrase.
- The machine translation uses ""federal state"" instead of ""tsaaririigis"" (empire), which changes the meaning slightly.
- The machine translation has ""and numerous new city centres emerged"" as a separate clause, while the source text combines this with the previous sentence using ""; esile kerkis"" (emerged). The reference translation combines them as well.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity (omitting ""Teises Bulgaaria tsaaririigis"" and using ""urban networks"" instead of ""linnavõrgustik""), context (referring to an empire instead of a federal state), and sentence structure (combining the two clauses differently).

|Reference translation: The tense situation only deteriorated when Napoleon sent the expeditionary forces to break the revolution in Haiti.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Pingeline"" vs. ""dramatic""**: The source text uses ""pingeline,"" which can be translated as ""tense"" or ""pressing"" in this context, referring to the intensity of the situation. The machine translation uses ""dramatic,"" which is a more general term for a situation that is intense or emotionally charged, but not necessarily tense. The reference translation uses ""tense,"" which is a more accurate translation of ""pingeline"" in this context.

2. **""vaid halvenes"" vs. ""only deteriorated""**: Both ""vaid halvenes"" and ""only deteriorated"" convey the idea that the situation worsened, but the former is a bit more specific, suggesting that it was already in a delicate state before the event. The machine translation captures this idea, but the reference translation uses ""only"" to emphasize the same point.

3. **""purustama"" vs. ""to break""**: The source text uses the verb ""purustama,"" which means ""to crush"" or ""to suppress"" in this context, referring to the act of putting down the revolution. The machine translation uses ""to break,"" which is a more general term that could include the idea of ending or disrupting the revolution. The reference translation uses ""to break,"" which is a suitable translation that conveys the same meaning.

4. **Overall**: The machine translation captures the essence of the source text, but there are minor differences in nuance, particularly in the choice of ""dramatic"" instead of ""pingeline"" and the use of ""to break"" instead of ""purustama."" The reference translation is more precise and faithful to the original Estonian, especially in terms of the tense and the verb choice.|

Machine translation: ""Iraq, which joined in 1932, was the first Member State to have been the mandate of the UPM.""

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- The machine translation uses ""UPM"" instead of ""Rahvasteliidu"" (League of Nations) from the source text.
- The phrase ""varem ühtlasi olnud"" in the source text is translated as ""to have been the mandate"" in the machine translation, but it's not directly translated.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: ""Iraq, which joined in 1932, was the first member state that had been a mandate territory of the League of Nations.""

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The main difference is the use of ""UPM"" in the machine translation, which should be replaced with ""Rahvasteliidu"" or ""League of Nations"" as in the reference translation.
- The phrase ""varem ühtlasi olnud"" is translated more accurately in the reference translation as ""that had been a mandate territory.""

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the correct name of the organization (UPM vs. Rahvasteliidu/League of Nations) and the structure of the sentence to convey the idea of the mandate status.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Uus peapiiskop pühitsetakse ametisse 2. veebruaril 2015.
Machine translation: The new Archbishop will be inaugurated on 2 February 2015.

Step 2: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- Uus peapiiskop (new Archbishop)
- pühitsetakse ametisse (inaugurated into office)
- 2. veebruaril 2015 (2nd February 2015)

Step 3: Compare the key phrases and words with the machine translation.
- ""The new Archbishop"" corresponds to ""Uus peapiiskop.""
- ""will be inaugurated on"" is a correct translation of ""pühitsetakse ametisse.""
- ""2 February 2015"" is the same in both the source and machine translation.

Step 4: Analyze any differences or discrepancies.
- There are no significant differences or discrepancies in the translation. The machine translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is of high quality and closely aligns with the reference translation. The only difference is the formatting, but since dates are often presented in a consistent format, it does not affect the meaning. The translation is faithful to the original Estonian text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Identify the main subject and action
Source: Norra kuningate dünastia ühendati (The dynasty of Norwegian kings was merged)
Machine translation: The Norwegian kings' syndrome was merged
Reference translation: The dynasty of Norwegian kings was merged

Difference: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""dünastia"" (dynasty) as ""syndrome"" which is a medical term and not the historical context.

Step 2: Identify the time frames
Source: 1319 Rootsi omaga ja 1380 Taani omaga (with Sweden in 1319 and Denmark in 1380)
Machine translation: 1319 Swedish and 1380 Danish
Reference translation: with the Swedish one and in 1380 with the Danish one

Difference: The machine translation omits the prepositions ""with"" and ""in"" and does not clearly indicate the relationship between the time frames and the countries.

Step 3: Identify the outcome
Source: suri välja (died out)
Machine translation: died out of
Reference translation: died out

Difference: The machine translation adds ""of"" which is not necessary in this context and slightly changes the meaning, making it sound like the death was caused by something.

Step 4: Combine the analysis
The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the interpretation of ""dünastia"" as ""syndrome,"" the lack of prepositions to connect the time frames and countries, and the unnecessary addition of ""of"" in the outcome. The correct translation should maintain the historical context and accurately convey the information about the dynasty, its mergers, and its extinction.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Ordu lähemaks eesmärgiks peab ta ülestõusu leviku peatamist ja läbirääkimiste teel aja võitmist vägede kogumiseks.
Machine translation: It must aim more closely to halt the spread of the uprising and to gain time through negotiation to gather troops.

Step 2: Identify differences in sentence structure and word choice.
- ""Ordu lähemaks eesmärgiks"" (closer to the goal of the Order) is translated as ""It must aim more closely"".
- ""ta ülestõusu leviku peatamist"" (halt the spread of the uprising) is translated as ""halt the spread of the uprising"".
- ""ja läbirääkimiste teel aja võitmist"" (and to gain time through negotiation) is translated as ""and to gain time through negotiation"".
- ""vägede kogumiseks"" (to gather troops) is translated as ""to gather troops"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The phrase ""lähemaks eesmärgiks"" is not directly translated, but the meaning is preserved in the phrase ""more closely to aim"".
- The verb ""peab"" (needs) is implied in the machine translation, but not explicitly stated.

Step 4: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: He believes that the immediate goal of the Order is to halt the spread of the uprising and to gain time through negotiation to gather troops.

Step 5: Conclusion.
The machine translation captures the main ideas of the source text but loses some nuance and structure. It omits the subject ""He believes"" and the word ""immediate"" from the reference translation, which slightly alters the meaning. The translation is accurate in terms of conveying the core message but could be improved by including these details.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Nhamadjo volitused presidendina jõustusid alles 11. mail.
Machine translation: As President of Nhamadjo, the mandate entered into force only on 11 May.

Step 2: Identify differences in structure and word order.
- The source text uses ""volitused presidendina"" (mandate as president), while the machine translation separates it into ""As President of Nhamadjo.""
- The source text uses ""jõustusid alles"" (entered into force), while the machine translation uses ""entered into force.""

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences on meaning.
- The machine translation adds ""As President of"" which clarifies the role but changes the sentence structure, making it less direct.
- The phrase ""jõustusid alles"" is translated as ""only on 11 May"" in the machine translation, which conveys the same meaning but with a different phrasing.

Step 4: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Nhamadjo 's Presidential mandate entered into force only on 11 May.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation captures the essential meaning but loses some of the directness and word order from the source text.
- The reference translation is more faithful to the original structure, with the possessive 's added to ""Nhamadjo"" and a similar phrasing for ""entered into force.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is accurate in conveying the meaning but with a less direct and slightly altered structure. The reference translation is a more faithful representation of the source text, particularly in terms of word order and clarity. The quality of the machine translation could be improved by maintaining a closer adherence to the original structure and word choice.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Aga sel juhul peab esimese teo pretsedendiks pidamine põhinema segiajamisel.
Machine translation: In this case, however, setting a precedent for the first act must be based on adventures.

Step 2: Identify key differences.
- ""pretsedendiks pidamine"" (setting a precedent) is translated as ""adventures"" in the machine translation, which is not an accurate equivalent. ""Pretsendendiks pidamine"" refers to the act of establishing a precedent, while ""adventures"" implies a series of exciting or risky events.

Step 3: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
Reference translation: In this case, however, setting a precedent for the first act must be based on confusion.

Step 4: Analyze the difference.
- The reference translation uses ""confusion"" to convey the idea behind ""segiajamisel"" in the source text, which is a more fitting term for the context, as it suggests a lack of clarity or order, which is often associated with establishing a precedent.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it translates ""segiajamisel"" as ""adventures,"" which is not an accurate representation of the concept in the source text. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses ""confusion,"" which better captures the meaning in Estonian. The quality of the machine translation could be improved by using ""confusion"" or a similar term that conveys the idea of establishing a precedent based on uncertainty or lack of clarity.

Source: Mingi praktika võib olla meie kogemusega nii otseselt seotud, et põhjend, mille see annab, on tugevam kui mis tahes põhjend selle kasuks.
Machine translation: Some of these practices may be so directly linked to our experience that the cause it gives is stronger than any reason for doing so.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- The machine translation has ""the cause it gives"" instead of ""põhjend, mille see annab"" (the reason it provides). This is a slight difference in phrasing, but the meaning is preserved.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Some of these practices may be so directly linked to our experience that the reason it gives is stronger than any reason for doing so.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation uses ""the reason it gives"" which is a more concise way of expressing the same idea as ""põhjend, mille see annab."" The reference translation omits the word ""mille"" (which means ""which"" in English), but the meaning is clear from the context.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in phrasing. The core meaning is preserved, and the difference does not significantly affect the quality of the translation. The main difference is the reference translation's more concise use of ""the reason it gives"" instead of ""the cause it gives."" Overall, the machine translation is of good quality.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly in line with each other, with only a minor difference in punctuation. The machine translation uses an Oxford comma ("", and by"") before ""Secretary-General Kadri Must,"" while the reference translation omits it. This difference is a matter of style rather than a significant change in meaning. The core information, such as the names and positions, is accurately conveyed in both translations.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. Both translations identify the subject: ""The candidate's list.""
2. The source mentions ""erakonna esimees"" (party chairman) and ""peasekretär"" (secretary-general) in Estonian, which are accurately translated to ""party's chairman"" and ""Secretary-General"" in English.
3. The names, ""Edgar Savisaar"" and ""Kadri Must,"" are identical in both translations.
4. The machine translation includes the Oxford comma, while the reference translation omits it, which is a stylistic choice.

Overall, the machine translation is of high quality and conveys the meaning of the source text effectively, with only a minor punctuation difference.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Iga kord kui ta püüab mõnd sündmust ära hoida
Machine translation: Every time he tries to prevent one event

The machine translation omits the word ""ära"" which means ""to not"" or ""away from"" in Estonian. This is important to convey the intended meaning of preventing an event from happening.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: Every time he tries to prevent one event
Reference translation: Every time he tries to prevent an event

The reference translation uses ""an event"" instead of ""one event."" In this context, ""an event"" is a more appropriate choice as it is a general term and does not imply a specific, singular event.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in two ways:
1. It omits the word ""ära,"" which is crucial for understanding the action of preventing an event from happening.
2. It uses ""one event"" instead of ""an event,"" which is a less precise choice in English.

To improve the quality of the translation, the machine translation should include ""ära"" and use ""an event"" instead of ""one event."" The revised machine translation would be: ""Every time he tries to prevent an event, it fails.""

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: In 1265, Baibars Caesarea, Haifa and Arsufi were seized; 1266 Safe and Toron were closed in 2009.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In 1265 , Sultan Baibars occupied Caesarea , Haifa and Arsuf ; in 1266 , Safad and Toron .

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""vallutas"" (conquered) as ""were seized"" (implies a more violent or administrative action, not necessarily conquest), which changes the meaning.
- It omits the title ""sultan"" from ""Baibars"" in the machine translation, which is important for context and proper identification of the subject.
- The machine translation incorrectly adds the detail about ""closed in 2009"" for Safad and Toron, which is not present in the source text and is irrelevant to the historical context.
- The word order is slightly different in the machine translation, with ""1266"" coming before the locations, while the reference translation places the locations first.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation because it inaccurately conveys the meaning, omits important context, and adds irrelevant information. The differences highlight the need for a translation that accurately reflects the historical event and maintains the original meaning and structure.

|Reference translation: The Prime Minister of Estonia, Andrus Ansip, began a formal visit to the United States, meeting, among others, with Vice-President Richard Cheney in Washington.|

Analysis:
1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same essential information: Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip started a formal visit to the United States and met with Vice-President Richard Cheney in Washington.
2. The main difference lies in the phrase ""kohtudes Washingtonis teiste seas ka asepresident Richard Cheneyga"" in the source text, which is translated as ""meeting with Vice-President Richard Cheney in Washington, among others"" in the machine translation. The reference translation omits the phrase ""teiste seas ka"" (among others) and instead uses a more concise structure ""meeting, among others, with Vice-President Richard Cheney in Washington.""

The machine translation is slightly less precise than the reference translation because it includes the ""among others"" part, which is not strictly necessary in the English context, but it does not lose any essential information. The meaning is still clear that there were other meetings in addition to the one with Cheney. Overall, the machine translation is of good quality, but the reference translation is more concise and idiomatic.

Machine translation: They initially invaded the East, where there were Hutu refugees to Tanzania.

Step 2: Identify differences in sentence structure and word choice.
- ""esialgu"" (initially) is translated correctly as ""initially.""
- ""idaosa"" (eastern part) is translated as ""the East,"" which is a generalization, losing the specific reference to a part.
- ""kust"" (from where) is not directly translated, but implied by ""where there were.""
- ""hutud põgenesid"" (the Hutu escaped) is translated as ""Hutu refugees to Tanzania,"" which changes the meaning, suggesting the refugees were already in Tanzania, rather than escaping.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: They initially invaded the eastern part, from where the Hutu escapted to Tanzania.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation maintains the specific reference to ""eastern part"" (idaosa) and keeps the meaning of the source text by using ""from where"" (kust) to indicate the origin of the escape.

|Machine translation: Those who grow cattle, sheep and goats themselves consider them to be surroundings of status and are not happy to kill them.|
|Reference translation: Those who grow cattle, sheep and goats consider them to be status symbols and are reluctant to slaughter them.|

|Analysis:|
1. The source text refers to ""staatusesümboliteks"" (status symbols), which is a compound noun in Estonian. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""surroundings of status,"" which is a less precise and accurate representation of the original meaning.
2. The machine translation uses ""are not happy to kill them"" (ega taha neid hea meelega tappa), which implies a negative emotional response to killing. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses ""are reluctant to slaughter them"" (are reluctant), which conveys a more nuanced idea of hesitation or unwillingness, rather than a negative emotion.
3. The word ""ega"" in the source text is a conjunction that negates the verb ""taha"" (to want), but the machine translation does not capture this nuance, making the sentence less clear.

|Conclusion:|
The machine translation has some inaccuracies in capturing the nuances of the original Estonian text. It would be more accurate to translate the source as ""Those who raise cattle, sheep, and goats consider them to be status symbols and are reluctant to slaughter them,"" which better aligns with the reference translation.|im_end|

|Reference translation: An argument is satisfactory when clearly speaking according to the substance ; accuracy must not be sought in all arguments in the same way , as in the case of handicrafts.|

|Analysis:|
1. **""Arutlus"" vs. ""An argument"":** The machine translation uses ""The debate"" while the reference translation uses ""An argument."" In Estonian, ""arutlus"" can refer to a general discussion or debate, but it's not necessarily limited to a formal argument. The reference translation chooses ""An argument"" to convey a more specific context, which is more accurate.
2. **""rahuldav"" vs. ""satisfactory"":** Both translations capture the meaning of ""rahuldav"" as ""satisfactory,"" but the reference translation uses ""satisfactory"" for consistency with the English language.
3. **""kui räägitakse selgelt vastavalt ainele"" vs. ""when clearly speaking according to the substance"":** The machine translation is close, but the reference translation rephrases it to sound more natural in English: ""when clearly speaking according to the substance.""
4. **""kõikidest arutlustest ei tule ühtemoodi täpsust otsida"" vs. ""accuracy must not be sought in all arguments"":** The machine translation attempts to convey the idea but is not as clear as the reference translation.

Machine translation: On the other hand, the obligation on the other side to make it possible for the other side to change the law granting the right of command of an item.

Step 2: Identify key differences.
- ""võimalikuks eseme käsutusõigust"" (possible use of an item) in the source is translated as ""the right of command of an item"" in the machine translation. This is a difference in meaning, as ""käsutusõigus"" refers to the right to use or dispose of an item, not necessarily command.
- ""üleminek"" (transfer) in the source is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it is translated as ""change the law"", which is not the same as a transfer of rights.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: On the other hand, the party will be obliged to make it possible for the other side to transfer the right granting the right of disposal of an item.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation captures the idea of ""võimalikuks"" (possible) and ""üleminek"" (transfer) more accurately, translating it as ""to transfer the right"" and ""the right of disposal.""
- The reference also uses ""party"" instead of ""side,"" which might be a more natural choice in English, but the meaning is still clear.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific rights (käsutusõigus vs. disposal) and the action of transferring the right rather than changing a law. The reference translation better conveys the meaning of the source text in English.

|mt|: <b>This is proven by the fact that the Pope, on his own initiative, released Christian warrants from the pledge to continue the campaign against Pühale Maale.</b>|
|diff|:

1. **Pope's legate**: In the reference translation, it specifies that the legate is acting on behalf of the Pope, which is important for understanding the context. The machine translation omits this distinction, referring to ""the Pope"" directly.

2. **Christian warrants**: The machine translation uses ""Christian warrants"" which might imply some legal documents, while the reference translation uses ""the crusaders from their oath,"" which is more specific and refers to the crusaders' commitment to continue the campaign.

3. **Pledge**: The reference translation uses ""pledge"" to describe the commitment or vow the crusaders made, which is clearer than the machine translation's ""pledge to continue the campaign,"" which is less direct.

4. **Holy Land**: The machine translation uses ""Pühale Maale,"" which is a less common or accurate term for the Holy Land in English. The reference translation uses ""the Holy Land,"" which is the standard term.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of clarity, specificity, and the use of terminology. The reference translation provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the source text.

1. Read the source text: ""Ranniku ja jõgede lähedal on suur osa metsast maha võetud.""
2. Read the machine translation: ""A large part of the forest has been taken off the coast and along the rivers.""
3. Read the reference translation: ""A large part of the forest has been cut down near the coast and rivers.""

4. Compare the verb phrases: In the source, ""on suur osa maha võetud"" means ""has been taken down"" or ""has been cut down."" The machine translation uses ""has been taken off,"" which is not an exact match for the original meaning, as ""take off"" typically refers to removal from a surface or location, not the act of cutting down.

5. Compare the prepositional phrases: The source mentions ""Ranniku ja jõgede lähedal,"" which means ""near the coast and rivers."" The machine translation translates this as ""off the coast and along the rivers,"" which is close but not identical, as ""along"" is not as precise as ""near"" in this context.

6. Analyze the differences: The main difference lies in the verb ""taken off"" vs. ""cut down,"" which changes the meaning slightly. The prepositional phrase ""off the coast and along the rivers"" is a reasonable approximation but not a perfect match for ""near the coast and rivers.""

7. Conclusion: The machine translation captures the general idea but loses some nuance and accuracy in the verb choice and the prepositional phrase. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian text in terms of meaning and expression.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Pharmaceutical products used in emergency medicine are primarily suitable for treating life-threatening conditions.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the source text
- The source text mentions ""kiirabis kasutatavad ravimid"" which refers to medicines used in emergencies (implying a context of urgent care).
- The machine translation omits this context, translating it as ""used in the country"" which is a more general statement.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation does not specify ""emergency medicine"" as in the reference translation, which is crucial for understanding the intended meaning.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it lacks the specific context of ""emergency medicine,"" which is important for accurately conveying the meaning of the source text. The reference translation provides a clearer and more precise translation by specifying the context.

|Machine translation: The demonstrations in Papua province in Indonesia called for the closure of a gold mine near the town of Jayapura.|
|Reference translation: The demonstrations in Papua province in Indonesia called for the closure of a gold mine near the town of Jayapura.|

|Analysis|
1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same essential information: demonstrations in Papua province, Indonesia, are requesting the closure of a gold mine located near Jayapura town.
2. The sentence structure is preserved in both translations, with the subject being ""the demonstrations"" and the action being ""called for the closure.""
3. The phrase ""nõuti Jayapura linna lähistel asuva"" is translated as ""near the town of Jayapura"" in both, which is accurate and consistent.
4. The only difference between the two is the presence of a comma after ""Jayapura"" in the machine translation. In Estonian, a comma is often used to separate the location from the main clause, while in English, it is not standard. However, this does not significantly alter the meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality and captures the essence of the source text. The only minor difference is the comma usage, which does not affect the clarity of the message. Overall, the translation is accurate and faithful to the original meaning.

|Reference translation:| As can be seen from the title of the album, the musician returned to the early days of blues music by performing these songs.

|Analysis|
1. **Difference in context**: The machine translation uses ""bluustorusness"" which is not a standard term in English. The reference translation correctly uses ""blues music,"" which is a well-known genre.
2. **Missing information**: The source mentions ""plaadi pealkirjastki näha"" (from the title of the album), but the machine translation omits this detail, making it less clear that the context is an album title.
3. **Action description**: The source states ""pöördus"" (return) and ""esitades"" (presenting), while the machine translation combines these into ""returned to"" and ""presenting these stories,"" which is less specific about the act of performing songs.

|Reference translation: In Georgia, the Commander of the Joint Headquarters of the Defence Forces, Georgi Kalandadze, was arrested under the suspicion of acting in excess of his powers.|

|Analysis:|
1. **Commander's title**: The source mentions ""ülem"" which refers to a high-ranking position, but the machine translation uses ""Commander of the Defence Force"" which is more specific. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""Commander of the Joint Headquarters of the Defence Forces.""
2. **Arrest context**: The source states that Kalandadze was arrested ""öösel"" (at night), but the machine translation omits this detail. The reference translation includes it, providing a clearer picture of the timing.
3. **Suspicions**: The source mentions ""kahtlustus võimupiiri ületamises"" (suspected of exceeding his powers), which implies a broader context than just crossing borders. The machine translation simplifies this to ""crossing the borders of power,"" which loses the nuance of power abuse.

|Reference translation: As a result of the accident, vehicles caught fire, twenty-four died and seventeen people were injured.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""süttisid"" which means ""caught fire"" in Estonian. The machine translation uses ""burned,"" which is a close but not exact equivalent. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""caught fire.""
2. The source text includes ""põlema"" (burning), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation omits this detail, but it's not crucial for understanding the main point.
3. The number of fatalities is ""kakskümmend neli"" (twenty-four) in the source, which is accurately translated as ""twenty-four"" in both the machine and reference translations.
4. The number of injured people is ""seitseteist"" (seventeen) in the source, which is also correctly translated as ""seventeen"" in both translations.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the verb choice for the fire event (""burned"" vs. ""caught fire""). The reference translation omits the word ""põlema"" but still conveys the same meaning. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, with only a slight loss of nuance in the fire description. The numbers and the main points are correctly translated.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The disease from Darwin was never fully diagnosed, and no attempt to cure it was very successful.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The disease that Darwin suffered from was never fully diagnosed, and no attempt to cure it was particularly successful.

Step 4: Compare the differences
1. In the machine translation, ""Darwini poolt põetavale haigusele"" is translated as ""The disease from Darwin,"" which omits the implied connection that the disease was related to Darwin (likely referring to Charles Darwin). The reference translation uses ""The disease that Darwin suffered from,"" which makes the connection more explicit.
2. The machine translation uses ""never fully diagnosed"" while the reference translation uses ""never fully diagnosed,"" which is a direct match.
3. The machine translation states ""no attempt to cure it was very successful,"" which implies a high level of success, whereas the reference translation says ""no attempt to cure it was particularly successful,"" which suggests a more nuanced or less successful attempt.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the relationship to Darwin and the degree of success in attempts to cure the disease. The reference translation provides a clearer context and a more accurate representation of the original Estonian text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The city protected only around 7 000 people, 2 000 of whom were foreigners.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The city was protected by only around 7 000 armed individuals, 2 000 of whom were foreigners.

Step 4: Compare the key elements
- In the source, ""kaitses"" (protected) is translated as ""protected"" in both the machine and reference translations.
- ""vaid ligi 7000 relvakandjat"" (only around 7000 relvakandjat) is translated as ""only around 7 000 people"" in the machine translation, but it should be ""around 7 000 armed individuals"" to match the reference.
- ""kellest 2000 olid võõramaalased"" (2000 of whom were foreigners) is translated as ""2 000 of whom were foreigners"" in both, which is consistent.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
The main difference is the translation of ""relvakandjat"" (relva means ""armament"" or ""weapon"" and ""kandja"" means ""carrier"" or ""carrier person"" in Estonian). The machine translation incorrectly assumes ""people"" when it should be ""armed individuals"" to match the context of protection.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the description of the protected individuals as ""armed individuals"" instead of ""people."" The rest of the sentence structure and meaning are similar. The quality of the translation could be improved by specifying that the individuals were armed.

Step 2: Compare the subjects in the machine translation and reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""German Order"" and ""its branch of Libya""
- Reference translation: ""Teutonic Order"" and ""its Livonian branch""

The subjects are different. The machine translation incorrectly identifies the order as ""German Order"" instead of ""Teutonic Order"" and refers to a ""branch of Libya"" instead of ""Livonian branch.""

Step 3: Compare the actions and context.
- Machine translation: ""One of the main preoccupations for Egena""
- Reference translation: ""One of the main contenders for Estonia""

The context is slightly different, as ""preoccupations"" suggests a more general concern, while ""contenders"" implies a more direct competition. The reference translation is more accurate in this context.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways:
- Incorrect identification of the order as ""German Order"" instead of ""Teutonic Order.""
- Incorrect translation of ""Liivimaa haru"" as ""branch of Libya"" when it should be ""Livonian branch.""
- The reference translation uses ""contenders"" to describe the relationship between Estonia and the order, which is more precise than the machine translation's ""preoccupations.""

|im_start|>|im_sep|>|ref|: Reference - It is currently mainly trusted only by highly optimistic Marxists, who are in favour of its materialistic version.

Analysis:
1. The machine translation (MT) omits the word ""Marxists"" from the source, which is a crucial part of the context, as it specifies the group that trusts the statement.
2. The MT uses ""markers"" instead of ""optimistlikud marksistid,"" which is a mistranslation. ""Markers"" does not convey the meaning of ""optimistic Marxists"" in this context.
3. The phrase ""peamiselt ainult"" in the source means ""mainly only,"" which implies a sense of exclusivity or limited trust. The MT does not capture this nuance, using ""mainly"" without the ""only.""

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of specificity (omitting ""Marxists"") and nuance (misinterpreting ""optimistlikud marksistid"" and not conveying the exclusivity of ""peamiselt ainult"").

Conclusion: The machine translation could be improved by using ""thick books"" instead of ""shackles"" and leaving out ""paksudesse"" to better align with the reference translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start| Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Siiski, mitte just päris nii nagu Aino oleks lootnud.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: However, not as if the only one had hoped.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: However, not exactly as Aino had hoped.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""the only one"" instead of ""Aino"" which is a specific name in the source text. This is a loss of context and personalization.
- The machine translation uses ""not as if"" while the reference translation uses ""not exactly."" The latter is more precise and conveys the nuance that Aino's hope was not met exactly, rather than just not at all.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity (using ""Aino"" instead of ""the only one"") and nuance (using ""not exactly"" instead of ""not as if""). The reference translation better captures the original meaning and context of the source text.

|ref|: Musk estimated that it would take ten years to build a Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

|im_diff|1. ""Muski hinnangul"" (Musk's estimate) vs ""The Roma estimate"" - The machine translation attributes the estimate to ""The Roma"" instead of Musk, which is incorrect.
|im_diff|2. ""väljaehitamiseks"" (to build) vs ""to build"" - The machine translation omits the English verb ""to build"" after ""it would take"", making the sentence less clear.

The machine translation and the reference translation are almost identical, with only a minor difference in punctuation. The machine translation has a comma after ""race"" while the reference translation omits it. This difference is likely a typographical error or a minor variation in style, as the meaning is the same in both cases.

**Analysis:**

1. **Subject and verb**: The source text refers to ""uuemad autorid"" (newer authors) sharing ""Feyerabendi skepsist"" (Feyerabend's skepticism), while the machine translation incorrectly suggests that the authors are ""shared"" according to a ""Feyerabit scheme."" The reference translation correctly uses ""Feyerabend 's skepticism"" as the subject being shared.

2. **Possessive form**: The source uses ""kellel"" (of whom) to indicate the authors' possession of a sociological or postmodernist view, which is not clearly expressed in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly uses ""who have"" to convey this idea.

3. **Skepticism vs. scheme**: The machine translation incorrectly equates Feyerabend's approach with a ""scheme,"" whereas the reference translation specifies that it is his ""skepticism"" that is shared.

4. **Word order**: The source text has a more direct structure, while the machine translation rephrases the sentence in a way that is less natural and more complex. The reference translation maintains a similar structure to the source.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of Feyerabend's approach, the possessive relationship between the authors and their views, and the word order, which results in a less accurate representation of the source text. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuances of the original Estonian text.

|Machine translation: On 31 March, the Latvian branch stopped registering new customers and opening deposits.|
|Reference translation: On 31 March, the Latvian branch of the bank stopped registering new customers and opening deposits.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""panga Läti filiaal"" (bank's Latvian branch), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation includes ""the Latvian branch of the bank"" to clarify that it's a branch of a specific bank.
2. The verb ""lõpetas"" (ended) in the source text is translated as ""stopped"" in both the machine and reference translations, which is accurate.
3. The phrase ""uute klientide registreerimise"" (registration of new customers) is translated as ""registering new customers"" in both, which is correct.
4. ""ja hoiuste avamise"" (and service opening) is translated as ""and opening deposits"" in the machine translation, but it's not clear if ""hoiuste"" refers specifically to deposits or services in general. The reference translation omits this part, which might be a loss of information.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by including ""the bank"" after ""Latvian branch"" to provide clarity and by potentially rephrasing ""and opening deposits"" to better convey the context, as it's not clear if ""hoiuste"" refers only to deposits or services. The reference translation is more precise in this regard.

|Reference translation: According to a study carried out in 2012 by Save the Children, the Estonian maternal welfare index is ranked 10th in the world.|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation uses ""the 10th most important"" to describe the position, while the reference translation uses ""ranked 10th."" The difference here is that ""ranked"" more accurately conveys the idea of a position in a list, whereas ""most important"" implies a level of importance rather than a specific ranking.
2. The source text includes ""kohaselt"" which means ""according to"" or ""based on"" in Estonian. The machine translation omits this, making the sentence slightly less clear about the source of the information.
3. The punctuation at the end of the sentence is different: the source has a period after ""maailmas 10. kohal"", while the machine translation omits it. The reference translation includes a period, but it's not a significant difference in meaning.

Overall, the machine translation captures the main idea but loses some nuance and clarity in the phrasing. The reference translation is more faithful to the original structure and meaning.

1. ""Kuigi luuletajad"" (Although poets) - The machine translation uses ""poet had to be expelled"" which is a singular form, while the reference translation is plural, referring to multiple poets. This is a difference in number agreement.
2. ""tuli tema riigist välja"" (from his country) - The machine translation omits the possessive pronoun ""tema"" (his) and uses ""his country"" directly, which is less clear than the reference translation.
3. ""tänu"" (because) - The machine translation does not include this word, which is necessary to convey the cause in the original sentence.
4. ""ajada"" (to be expelled) - The machine translation uses ""expelled"" as a verb, but it's not in the past participle form, which is needed to match the structure of the sentence. The reference translation uses ""had to be expelled"" in the past participle form.
5. ""oli ta ise"" (he himself) - The machine translation omits ""ta ise"" (himself), which is important for emphasizing that the subject is the same as the one being expelled.
6. ""kõige suurem"" (the greatest) - The machine translation uses ""the biggest"" instead, which is not as accurate as ""the greatest"" in conveying the superlative meaning.
7. ""luuletaja"" (poet) - The machine translation is correct here.
8. ""valetaja"" (liar) - The machine translation uses ""deceit"" which is a noun, while the reference uses ""liar"" as a direct translation of the term.
9. ""šarlatan"" (charlatan) - The machine translation uses ""the shamblest"" which is not a correct translation. The reference uses ""charlatan"" directly.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Alates 1960ndatest sai tavaliseks järeldada, et adekvaatsem teaduse teooria peab lähtuma teoreetilise raamistiku mõistmisest.
Machine translation: Since the 1960s, it was common practice to conclude that a more adequate scientific theory must be based on an understanding of the theoretical framework.

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The source text starts with ""Alates"" (meaning ""Since"" in Estonian), while the machine translation correctly uses ""Since the 1960s"".
- The source text uses ""sai tavaliseks"" (became common), which is not directly translated in the machine translation, but the meaning is preserved with ""it was common practice"".
- The source text has ""et"" (that) before ""adekvaatsem teaduse teooria"", which is not present in the machine translation, but the meaning is still clear in the context.
- The rest of the sentence is identical in both the source and machine translations.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: Since the 1960s, it was common practice to conclude that a more adequate scientific theory must be based on an understanding of the theoretical framework.
Reference translation: Since the 1960s, it was common practice to conclude that a more adequate scientific theory must be based on an understanding of the theoretical framework.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The only difference is the absence of ""et"" in the machine translation, which is a minor grammatical difference but does not change the overall meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor grammatical difference in the absence of ""et"". The meaning is preserved, and the core message from the source text is conveyed effectively. The main difference is the style, as the reference translation omits the conjunction ""et"" for a more concise English sentence. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is high.

The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly consistent, with a minor difference in the phrasing. The source text uses ""küsistanud,"" which means ""to visit"" in English, but the verb is in the past participle form, suggesting a completed action. The reference translation, however, uses ""to visit in the last 68 years,"" which is a more direct and clear way of expressing the same idea.

The machine translation correctly identifies Rama as the first Albanian Head of State and specifies the time frame of the last 68 years. The main difference lies in the choice of words to convey the temporal context. The reference translation provides a clearer and more natural English sentence by using ""in the last 68 years"" instead of ""over the last 68 years,"" which is a more common construction in English.

In summary, the machine translation is accurate in terms of content but could be improved in terms of naturalness by using ""in"" instead of ""over"" to indicate the time frame. The core meaning is preserved, but the reference translation offers a more idiomatic English sentence.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- The source text starts with ""Neil aastatel"" which means ""In these years"" in English. The machine translation accurately captures this phrase.
- ""rajati uued elamukvartalid"" translates to ""new residential blocks were created"" in both the machine and reference translations, which is correct.
- ""ja pöörati erilist tähelepanu"" means ""and particular attention was paid"" in English. The machine translation also has this phrase, but it's slightly different from the reference translation, which omits ""erilist"" (particular) and uses ""to"" instead of ""pöörati"" (paid attention).

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- The main difference lies in the phrase ""transpordiühenduste loomisele"" in the machine translation, which is translated as ""to the creation of transport links"" in the reference translation. The machine translation omits ""transpordiühenduste"" (transport links) and uses a more general phrase.

Conclusion:
The machine translation captures the overall meaning of the source text but loses some nuance by not including the specific term ""transpordiühenduste"" and using a slightly different structure for the attention paid part. The reference translation is more precise and faithful to the original Estonian text. The quality of the machine translation could be improved by including the specific term for transport links and maintaining the same structure as the reference.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: It must therefore be a cross-border definition.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: It must therefore be beyond empirical definitions.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the source text
- The machine translation uses ""cross-border"" to translate ""teispool"", which refers to the other side or both sides in this context. The source text does not specify a border but rather implies a contrast with empirical definitions.
- The machine translation uses ""definition"" to translate ""määratlusi"", which is the plural form of ""määratlemine"" (definition) in Estonian. The translation is accurate in this aspect.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""beyond empirical"" from the reference translation, which is crucial to convey the intended meaning that the definition should not be limited to empirical criteria.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not capture the idea of going ""beyond empirical"" as the reference does. Instead, it suggests a cross-border aspect, which is a different emphasis. The reference translation implies a need for a definition that transcends empirical observations, while the machine translation simply states that it should be a cross-border one without the nuance of being outside empirical boundaries.

|Reference translation: Emotion can be described as a feeling in the sense that it is somehow perceived, experienced.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Emotsiooni võib nimetada tundeks""** (Machine: ""Estimating can be described as being felt"") - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""emotsiooni"" (emotion) as ""estimating"", which is a different concept. The correct translation should be ""feeling"" or ""emotion"" as in the reference.
2. **""selles mõttes""** (Machine: ""in the sense that"") - This phrase is translated correctly, but the context is slightly different in the machine translation. The reference keeps the idea of a ""sense"" but does not include the word ""that"" explicitly.
3. **""et seda kuidagi teadvustatakse""** (Machine: ""it is somehow recognised"") - The machine translation is not accurate here. ""Teadvustatakse"" means ""to be perceived"" or ""to become aware of,"" while ""recognised"" implies a more conscious act of identifying. The reference translation uses ""perceived,"" which is a better fit.
4. **""elatakse läbi""** (Machine: ""is being pushed through"") - This phrase is not a suitable translation for the Estonian ""elatakse läbi,"" which means ""lived through"" or ""experienced."" The reference translation uses ""experienced,"" which is more accurate.

In summary, the machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the handling of the concept of emotion, the verb ""teadvustatakse,"" and the overall meaning of the passage.

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
- Source: ""Canberra päevale eelneb tihtipeale kümnepäevane ürituste sari Celebrate Canberra.""
- Machine translation: ""Canberra's day is often preceded by a ten-day series of events in Celebrate Canberra.""
- Reference translation: ""Canberra Day is often preceded by a ten-day series of events, Celebrate Canberra.""

The source sentence starts with ""Canberra päevale"" (literally ""to Canberra's day""), while the reference and machine translations start with ""Canberra Day"" and ""Canberra's day,"" respectively. The reference translation omits the possessive ""päevale"" and places ""Celebrate Canberra"" after the series of events.

Step 2: Check for differences in word order
- Source: ""tihtipeale kümnepäevane ürituste sari""
- Machine translation: ""a ten-day series of events in""
- Reference translation: ""a ten-day series of events""

The source uses ""tihtipeale"" (weekly) and ""kümnepäevane"" (ten-day) to describe the duration, while the machine translation omits these adjectives and combines them into ""a ten-day series."" The reference translation correctly omits these adjectives and keeps the meaning clear.

Step 3: Evaluate the translation of the event name
- Source: ""Celebrate Canberra""
- Machine translation: ""in Celebrate Canberra""
- Reference translation: ""Celebrate Canberra""

The source includes ""Celebrate Canberra"" at the end of the sentence, while the machine translation adds ""in"" before it, making it ""in Celebrate Canberra."" The reference translation keeps it as ""Celebrate Canberra"" without the ""in,"" which is more accurate.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:
1. It omits the possessive ""päevale"" and starts with ""Canberra's day"" instead of ""Canberra Day.""
2. It combines the adjectives ""tihtipeale"" and ""kümnepäevane"" into ""a ten-day series"" without them, while the reference omits them.
3. It adds ""in"" before ""Celebrate Canberra"" in the sentence, which is not present in the source or reference.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should be revised to match the reference translation: ""Canberra Day is often preceded by a ten-day series of events, Celebrate Canberra.""

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: President Obama kõneisik lükkas need süüdistused tagasi.
Machine translation: President Obama's spokesman rejected these accusations.

Step 2: Identify differences in translation.
- In the source text, ""kõneisik"" refers to a ""spokesman"" or ""representative"" in Estonian, while ""spokesman"" is directly translated in the machine translation.
- The verb ""lükkas"" means ""dismissed"" or ""threw back"" in Estonian, which is translated as ""rejected"" in English, but the word order is different in the machine translation.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
- The reference translation is ""President Obama 's spokesman rejected these accusations."" It has the same structure as the machine translation, with the possessive 's added to ""President Obama"" and a similar verb phrase.

Step 4: Analyze the quality.
- The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but it loses some nuance by not directly translating the Estonian word ""kõneisik"" as ""spokesman"" and by changing the word order slightly. The reference translation, while not entirely identical, is a close approximation and maintains the meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of word choice (""kõneisik"" vs. ""spokesman"") and word order, but it conveys the core message. The quality is decent but not perfect, as it omits the Estonian word for ""spokesman"" and adjusts the sentence structure.

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
Source: Inimese kogu elu tuleks järjestada inimelu ülimale ja viimsele eesmärgile.
Machine translation: The whole life of human beings should be ranked for the supreme and ultimate purpose of human life.
Reference translation: The whole life of human beings should be set to the supreme and ultimate purpose of human life.

The source sentence uses the verb ""järjestada"" (to arrange or set in order), while the reference translation uses ""set to"" or ""määrata"" (to assign or direct to). The machine translation uses ""ranked for,"" which is not as accurate as the other two options.

Step 2: Check for word choice and meaning
""Järjestada"" implies arranging or giving a hierarchical order, while ""set to"" or ""määrata"" convey the idea of assigning or directing something towards a specific goal. The machine translation's ""ranked for"" suggests a competition or comparison, which is not the intended meaning.

Step 3: Analyze the impact on meaning
The difference in verb choice affects the meaning slightly. The source and reference translations imply that a person's entire life should be guided or directed towards the ultimate purpose, whereas the machine translation might imply a ranking system, which is not the original intent.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in its choice of verb, which changes the meaning from a straightforward assignment or direction towards a life purpose to a suggestion of ranking or competition. The reference translation more accurately conveys the original Estonian idea of aligning one's life with the ultimate goal.

|im_start|>

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: 1381. aasta talupoegade mässu ajal piirati ümber Tower, kus viibis ka kuningas.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: During the riots between the peasants in 1381, I was surrounded by a person who was also Queen.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: During the peasant riots in 1481, the Tower was surrounded while the King was there.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation incorrectly identifies the subject of the event as ""I"" (which is not present in the source text) and translates ""kuningas"" (king) as ""a person who was also Queen,"" which is a misinterpretation.
- The year is incorrect in the machine translation, it says ""1381"" instead of ""1381. aasta"" (1381 year).
- The structure of the sentence is altered, with the Tower being the focus in the reference translation, while the machine translation suggests a personal experience.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, including incorrect identification of the subject, a misplaced year, and a change in sentence structure that does not accurately convey the original meaning. The quality of the translation is poor.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Ukrainas Donetski oblastis Zasjadko söekaevanduses toimus umbes kilomeetri sügavusel metaaniplahvatus.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: There was a metal explosion in the Donetski Oblastis Zmindko coal mine in Ukraine, at about a kilometre depths.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: There was a methane explosion at the dept of about one kilometre in the Donetsk Oblast, Zasyadko coal mine in Ukraine.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The source text mentions ""Zasjadko söekaevanduses"" (Zasjadko coal mine), while the machine translation has ""Zmindko coal mine."" This is a mistranslation.
- The source text uses ""söekaevanduses"" (coal mine), which is not directly translated to ""coal mine"" in the machine translation, but it is implied. However, the word ""söekaevandus"" is not translated correctly.
- The source text specifies ""umbes kilomeetri sügavusel"" (approximately one kilometre depth), while the machine translation says ""at about a kilometre depths,"" which is a slightly different phrasing but conveys a similar meaning.
- The reference translation correctly identifies the event as a ""methane explosion"" (metaaniplahvatus), which is not mentioned in the machine translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation has some errors, such as the incorrect name of the mine (Zasjadko vs. Zmindko) and the lack of explicit mention of the methane explosion. The depth is translated approximately correctly, but the overall quality is lower than the reference translation due to these discrepancies.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: Siseminister Arsen Avakovi nõuniku andmetel
- Machine translation: According to Mr Arsen Offkov's adviser
- Reference translation: According to the adviser to Arsen Avakov, Minister of the Interior

Difference: The machine translation incorrectly identifies ""Arsen Avakovi"" as ""Arsen Offkov"" and omits the title ""Minister of the Interior"" from the reference.

Step 2: Compare the rest of the sentence.
- Source: interventide valduses kaks Buk raketisüsteemi
- Machine translation: the intervention authorities hold two Buk missile systems
- Reference translation: the interventionists hold two Buk missile systems

Difference: The machine translation uses ""intervention authorities"" instead of ""interventionists"" which is a more accurate term to describe the group in this context.

Step 3: Combine the analysis.
The machine translation has differences in two main areas: it misidentifies the person as ""Arsen Offkov"" instead of ""Arsen Avakov"" and omits the title ""Minister of the Interior."" Additionally, it uses ""intervention authorities"" instead of the more specific ""interventionists."" The reference translation is more accurate in these respects.

- Machine translation: ""In cooperation with his Chancellor and later on Jan Zamoyski""
- Reference translation: ""In cooperation with his Chancellor and later Hetman Jan Zamoyski""

The main subjects are the person (who is successful in the war) and their cooperation with their Chancellor and Jan Zamoyski. The difference lies in the title ""hilisema hetmani"" (later hetman) in the source, which is not translated accurately.

Step 2: Compare the context
- The source specifies ""Liivimaa sõjas"" (war in Livonia), which is a historical context related to a specific region.
- Machine translation: ""war in Libya"" - This is a different geographical context, as Libya is not related to Livonia.

Step 3: Analyze the translation accuracy
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Liivimaa"" as ""Libya"", which is a mistranslation of the historical region.
- The reference translation correctly identifies ""Livonia"" as the historical context.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the geographical context, as it incorrectly translates ""Liivimaa"" as ""Libya"" instead of ""Livonia"". Additionally, the reference translation includes the title ""Hetman"" to describe Jan Zamoyski's role, which is not present in the machine translation.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Now the dispositions are no longer confronting each other, but the person is trying to resist an attack of disposition.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- In the machine translation, ""vastamisi"" is translated as ""tendencies"", which is not accurate in this context. The source text uses ""kalduvused"" (dispositions) which is a more suitable term for the situation.
- The machine translation says ""is opposed to an attack of a tendency"", while the reference translation says ""trying to resist an attack of disposition"". The reference translation is more precise, as it uses ""resist"" to describe the action, which is a better fit than ""opposed to"" in this context.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the term used for ""kalduvused"" (tendencies vs. dispositions) and the verb choice to describe the person's response (opposed to vs. trying to resist). The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Estonian text.

Step 1: Identify key phrases and words in the source text
- ""aasta üleminekupõhiseaduse järgi"" (under the transitional constitution)
- ""üldistel valimistel"" (general elections)
- ""5 aastaks"" (for 5 years)
- ""esimese presidendi pärast üleminekuaega"" (after the transition, the first President)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""Under the transitional constitution of the year for a general election of 5 years; after the transition, the National Assembly elected 2005.""
- Reference translation: ""transitional constitution, in a general election for 5 years; the first President after the transition was elected by the National Assembly in 2005.""

Step 3: Analyze differences
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""in a general election"" and combines it with the duration ""5 years"" in a way that is less clear than the reference translation.
- The machine translation incorrectly places ""the National Assembly elected 2005"" without specifying what was elected, while the reference translation specifies ""the first President.""
- The reference translation uses the correct preposition ""by"" to indicate the action of the National Assembly, which is missing in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation has several differences from the reference translation, including a lack of clarity in the election context, incorrect placement of events, and missing prepositions. The reference translation provides a more accurate and coherent representation of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start| Analyzing the machine translation and reference translation step by step:

1. **Source text**: The source text discusses the possibility of someone questioning whether they should still take into account other people's unpleasant feelings, specifically in the context of considering them as a certain type of thing (eelarvamustega, which refers to preconceived opinions).

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation states, ""He may start to ask whether he can consider people's unpleasant feelings as such."" Here, the phrase ""as such"" is used to refer to the feelings being considered in isolation or without context.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation adds the word ""are prejudices"" to the end, which changes the meaning to imply that the unpleasant feelings are being seen as a form of prejudice or preconceived judgment.

4. **Difference**: The machine translation does not explicitly mention the connection to prejudices, which is an important aspect of the source text's meaning. Instead, it suggests considering the feelings ""as such,"" which could be interpreted more generally without the negative connotation of prejudice.

5. **Quality evaluation**: The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it omits the crucial nuance that the feelings are being questioned in the context of being potentially prejudicial. The reference translation provides a more precise and complete understanding of the source text.

In conclusion, the machine translation could be improved by including the reference's clarification that the feelings are being considered as prejudices, to better align with the original Estonian text.

- Machine translation: ""In accordance with the provisions of the Settlement Contract, the Commission has the obligation to issue, to report and to maintain secrecy.""

Step 2: Identify key differences.
- ""käsunduslepingu"" (authorisation agreement) vs ""Settlement Contract""
- ""komisjonäril"" (to the Commission) vs ""the Commission""
- ""väljaandmisekohustus"" (obligation to release) vs ""to issue""

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: ""In accordance with the provisions of an authorisation agreement, a broker has the obligation to release, the obligation to notify and the obligation of confidentiality.""

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation uses ""Settlement Contract"" instead of ""authorisation agreement,"" which is a more precise term for the context.
- ""komisjonäril"" is translated as ""the Commission"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""a broker,"" which is more appropriate for the subject matter.
- The verb ""väljaandmisekohustus"" is translated as ""to issue"" in the machine translation, but the reference translation uses ""release,"" which is a more accurate term for the context.
- ""teatamiskohustus"" is translated as ""to report"" in the machine translation, which is correct, but the reference translation uses ""obligation to notify,"" which is clearer and more concise.
- ""saladuse hoidmise kohustus"" is translated as ""to maintain secrecy"" in the machine translation, which is accurate, but the reference translation uses ""obligation of confidentiality,"" which is more standard and idiomatic.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some differences in terminology and structure compared to the reference translation. It captures the main ideas but could be improved by using more specific terms like ""authorisation agreement"" and ""broker"" and by slightly rephrasing the verb phrases for better clarity.

3. **Comparing with reference translation**: ""What is living is dying, and that is simply because the living as such is carrying a seed of death.""
4. **Difference analysis**: 
   - **""Elav sureb""** (Machine: ""Living is dying"") - The machine translation captures the idea but omits the implied causality (""sureb"" means ""is dying"" in Estonian).
   - **""ja nimelt lihtsalt sellepärast""** (Machine: ""and that is simply because"") - The machine translation is accurate, but the word order is slightly different in English.
   - **""et elav kui niisugune kannab""** (Machine: ""as such is a seed"") - The machine translation simplifies the phrase, using ""as such"" instead of a more literal translation, and ""kannab endas surma seemet"" is translated as ""carrying a seed of death"" which is a good approximation.
   - **""surma seemet""** (Machine: ""death"") - The machine translation directly translates the word ""surma seemet"" as ""seed of death"", which is a common metaphor in English.

5. **Overall evaluation**: The machine translation captures the essence of the source text but loses some nuance in the causality and word choice. It is a decent translation but could be improved by maintaining a closer adherence to the original structure and using a more precise term for ""seed of death"" to convey the metaphor.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: This is a roughly two-metre piece of fabric that is worn on the skirt.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""kangatükk"" (carpet), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""two-metre-metre carpet"" (which is redundant and doesn't make sense).
- The source text uses ""umbes"" (approximately) to describe the size, but the machine translation omits this, making the size less precise.
- The source text refers to the fabric being ""kantakse seeliku peal"" (carried on the skirt), while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""being carried on the skirts"" (plural, which suggests multiple skirts, but the context is singular).

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation accurately translates ""kangatükk"" as ""piece of fabric"" and conveys the approximate size as ""roughly two-metre"".
- The reference translation correctly captures the idea of the fabric being ""worn on the skirt"" instead of being carried.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, precision, and the correct interpretation of the context.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly in line with each other, with only a minor difference in punctuation. The machine translation has a comma after ""history"" while the reference translation omits it. This difference is likely due to the choice of style or the way the sentence is constructed in the original source. The meaning conveyed by both translations is the same: they both state that it is the longest historical period in Estonia, spanning over 10,000 years.

In terms of quality evaluation, the machine translation is accurate in terms of content and structure, with the main subject, duration, and the comparison being correctly translated. The only potential issue is the punctuation, which might be slightly less standard in the machine translation. Overall, the quality is high, but the reference translation might be slightly more preferred for its adherence to the English language conventions.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Identify the main subject and action
Source: Rüütlite vägi (knight's army) oli aga oodatust väiksem (was smaller than expected)
Machine translation: the straw (incorrect subject, should be ""the army"")
Reference translation: the army (correct subject)

Step 2: Compare the description of the size
Source: väiksem (smaller)
Machine translation: smaller (correct)
Reference translation: smaller (correct)

Step 3: Identify the issue with financial resources
Source: puudusid piisavad rahalised vahendid (lacked sufficient financial resources)
Machine translation: lacked sufficient financial resources (correct)
Reference translation: lacked sufficient financial resources (correct)

Step 4: Analyze the target of the payment
Source: et maksta veneetslastele (to pay the Venetians)
Machine translation: to pay the Russian people (incorrect, should be ""Venetians"")
Reference translation: to pay Venetians (correct)

Step 5: Compare the context of shipping
Source: laevatranspordi eest (for shipping)
Machine translation: shipping (implied, but not explicit)
Reference translation: for shipping (correct, but not as explicit as the reference)

Conclusion: The machine translation has several errors, including the incorrect subject (straw instead of knight's army), the target of payment (Russian people instead of Venetians), and the lack of explicit context for shipping. The reference translation is more accurate in terms of subject, size, financial resources, and target audience, but the machine translation could be improved by specifying the payment for shipping to the Venetians.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Identify key terms and phrases in the source text
- Kuberneripuu (Julbernardia trees)
- kasvab (growing)
- platoodel (plateaus)
- akaatsiad (acacias)
- ahvileivapuud (baobabs)
- kombreetumid (combretums)
- viljakamal (more fertile)
- pinnasel (soil)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: Siberian trees (incorrect, should be ""Julbernardia trees"")
- Machine translation: growing on posters (misinterpretation, should be ""on plateaus"")
- Machine translation: academies (unnecessary, not in the source)
- Machine translation: greedy bread trees (incorrect, should be ""acacias"" and ""baobabs"")
- Machine translation: beverages (not in the source, should be ""combretums"")
- Machine translation: fertile soil (correct, but the phrase ""viljakamal pinnasel"" is not directly translated)

Step 3: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation incorrectly identifies the type of trees as Siberian instead of Julbernardia.
- It incorrectly combines ""acacias"" and ""baobabs"" into a single concept of ""greedy bread trees.""
- It omits ""akaatsiad"" (acacias) from the list of tree species.
- It adds ""academies"" and ""beverages"" which are not present in the source text.
- The phrase ""viljakamal pinnasel"" is not translated directly, but the meaning of ""more fertile soil"" is preserved.

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, including incorrect identification of tree species, misinterpretation of the context, and the addition of unrelated elements. The quality of the translation could be improved by accurately translating the tree species, removing unnecessary elements, and preserving the meaning of the original phrase about the soil fertility.

|Source: Armastus ei tulene põhjenditest, vaid loob põhjendeid.|
|Machine translation: The suspicion does not stem from the causes, but creates the causes.|
|Reference translation: Love does not come from reason, but creates reason.|

1. **Translation of key terms**: 
   - ""Armastus"" (Estonian) = ""Love"" (English)
   - ""tuleneb"" (Estonian) = ""come from"" (English)
   - ""põhjenditest"" (Estonian) = ""the causes"" (English)
   - ""loob"" (Estonian) = ""creates"" (English)
   - ""põhjendeid"" (Estonian) = ""reasons"" (English)

2. **Comparison of meaning**: 
   - The source text talks about ""armastus"" (love), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""suspicion."" This is a significant difference in meaning.

   - The source uses ""tuleneb"" (comes from) to describe the relationship between love and causes, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""stem from,"" which is similar but not identical in meaning.

   - The correct translation of ""põhjenditest"" (the causes) should be ""reasons"" in the context of love, as in the reference translation.

   - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""loob"" (creates) as ""creates the causes,"" which is not the intended meaning. The correct phrase should be ""creates reason.""

3. **Overall evaluation**: The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of meaning, particularly in the key term ""armastus"" (love) and the phrase ""loob põhjendeid"" (creates reasons). The mistranslation of ""armastus"" as ""suspicion"" and the incorrect handling of the cause/reason relationship result in a low-quality translation. The correct translation should be: ""Love does not come from reason, but creates reason.""

|Machine translation: In Estonia, there are 1 440 species and 560 species of indigenous species of plant and pillars.|
|Reference translation: In Estonia , there are 1 440 indigenous species of tracheophytes and 560 species of indigenous species of moss .|

1. **Translation of ""pärismaiseid soontaimi"":** The source text refers to ""pärismaiseid soontaimi,"" which is Estonian for ""indigenous plants"" or ""native trees."" The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""species of plant and pillars,"" which is not accurate, as ""pillars"" is not a suitable term for this context.

2. **Translation of ""1440 liiki"":** Both the machine and reference translations correctly convey the number ""1440 species.""

3. **Translation of ""ja samblaid"":** The source text includes ""ja samblaid,"" which means ""and similar"" or ""and counterparts"" in Estonian. The machine translation omits this part, making the sentence less precise.

4. **Translation of ""560 liiki"":** The number ""560 liiki"" is also correctly translated as ""560 species"" in both the machine and reference translations.

5. **Translation of ""soontaimi"" and ""samblaid"" context:** The reference translation specifies that these are ""indigenous species of tracheophytes"" (plants with a tracheary system) and ""indigenous species of moss,"" respectively. The machine translation does not provide this context, which is crucial for understanding the type of plants being discussed.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of accuracy and context. It incorrectly translates ""pärismaiseid soontaimi"" as ""species of plant and pillars"" and omits the crucial context about the types of plants (tracheophytes and moss). The reference translation provides a more precise and meaningful translation.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Naise otsustuses enda kohta kätkeb tema arusaamine selle tõsidusest, mida ta tegi.
Machine translation: A woman's own decision involves her understanding of the seriousness of what she has done.

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, which is about a woman's decision and her understanding of the seriousness of her actions. However, there are a few differences:

1. The source text uses the genitive form ""enda kohta"" (about herself), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. It is implied but not explicitly stated.
2. The source text uses the word ""selle"" (this) before ""tõsidusest"" (seriousness), which is not included in the machine translation.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: A woman 's own decision involves her understanding of the seriousness of what she has done.

The reference translation is very similar to the machine translation, with the only difference being the addition of the possessive apostrophe in ""woman 's"" to indicate ownership. The meaning is the same, but the reference translation is slightly more grammatically accurate.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by including the genitive form ""enda kohta"" and possibly adding the possessive apostrophe in ""woman's"" to match the reference translation more closely. The core meaning is preserved, but some nuances are lost in the translation.

1. **Subject analysis**: Both the machine translation and the reference translation have the same subject, ""Gabon writers,"" which is accurate.

2. **Adjective analysis**: The source uses ""eranditult"" (nearly exclusively), while the machine translation uses ""almost exclusively"" and the reference translation omits the adverb ""nearly"" or ""almost."" The meaning is similar, but the reference translation is more concise.

3. **Prepositional phrase analysis**: The source includes ""prantsuse keeles"" (in French), which is translated as ""in French"" in both the machine translation and the reference translation.

4. **Punctuation and apostrophe**: The source has no apostrophe in ""Gaboni,"" while the reference translation adds the possessive apostrophe 's. This is a minor difference, but the meaning is clear in both.

5. **Overall structure**: The structure of the sentence is preserved in both translations, with the subject, verb, and the emphasis on the exclusivity of French as the medium of writing.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the adverb ""nearly"" or ""almost"" and the possessive apostrophe. The core meaning is consistent with the reference translation, but the reference is slightly more concise. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but the reference provides a clearer and more idiomatic English version.

|Machine translation: In Estonia, the religious psychologist, Tkiss Lehtsaak, announced that he was standing for election to the State in the list of the Union of Isaland and Res Publica.|
|Reference translation: In Estonia, the religious psychologist, Tõnu Lehtsaar, announced that he was standing for election to the Riigikogu on the list of the Pro Patria and Res Publica Union.|

|Analysis|
1. The source mentions ""Isamaa ja Res Publica Liidu"" which translates to ""the Union of Isamaa and Res Publica"" in the reference translation. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Union of Isaland and Res Publica,"" which is a different political entity. The correct translation should be ""Pro Patria and Res Publica Union,"" which is a more accurate representation of the political party in Estonia.

2. The name of the religious psychologist is ""Tõnu Lehtsaar"" in both the source and reference translation. However, the machine translation has an error, using ""Tkiss Lehtsaak"" instead. This is a typographical error and should be corrected to ""Tõnu Lehtsaar.""

3. The context of ""valimistel"" (elections) is not present in the machine translation, which makes the sentence less clear about the purpose of the announcement.

4. The destination of the announcement, ""Riigikogu"" (the Estonian parliament), is not specified in the machine translation, which is a crucial part of the information.

Reference translation: And certainly he wanted to say that this knowledge must be innate.

Step 4: Compare the key phrases
- Machine translation: ""this knowledge must be an event""
- Reference translation: ""this knowledge must be innate""

Step 5: Identify the difference
The machine translation uses ""an event"" while the reference translation uses ""innate,"" which means ""existing naturally or as a part of one's nature"" in this context.

Step 6: Evaluate the quality
The machine translation is not accurate because ""kaasasündinud"" in Estonian refers to something being born with or inherent, whereas ""an event"" does not convey the same meaning. The correct translation should reflect the idea of something being inherent or innate.

Conclusion: The machine translation's quality is lower due to the incorrect interpretation of the Estonian term ""kaasasündinud"" as ""an event"" instead of ""innate."" The reference translation better captures the intended meaning of the source text.

Source: Tema konkreetsete ülesannete hulka kuulus partisanigruppide üle rindejoone saatmine.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Its particular tasks included sending a frontline over partisan groups.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: His particular tasks included sending partisan groups over the front line.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- In the source text, ""tema"" refers to ""his"" or ""its"" (depending on the context, but assuming it's a masculine subject), ""konkreetsete ülesannete hulka"" means ""specific tasks"", ""kuulus"" means ""included"", ""partisanigruppide üle"" means ""over partisan groups"", and ""rindejoone saatmine"" means ""sending a frontline"" (literally, ""line of battle"" but often translated as ""front line"" in this context).

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation has ""a frontline"" instead of ""rindejoone saatmine"" (which is a more direct translation of ""front line"").
- The phrase ""over partisan groups"" is translated correctly in both, but the word order is slightly different in the machine translation (""over partisan groups"" vs. ""partisan groups over"").

Step 6: Analyze the differences
- The main difference is the use of ""a"" before ""frontline"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the source text or the reference translation. This might be an issue with the translation system not fully understanding the context or the need for a definite article in this case.
- The word order is slightly different, but the meaning is preserved.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation mainly due to the use of ""a"" before ""frontline"" (which is not in the source or reference), and a slightly different word order. The core meaning is preserved, but the translation could be improved by removing the article and maintaining the original word order.

- The rest of the sentence structure is similar, with both translations indicating the location as ""in the east of the Iraq capital Baghdad.""

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The main difference is the specificity of the term ""roadside"" in the reference translation, which provides more context about where the bomb occurred. The machine translation omits this detail, making it less precise.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several aspects. It incorrectly translates the context of ""kasvatus"" and ""iseenda juures,"" and introduces a metaphor (""a machine of drowning"") that is not present in the source text.

The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the President of the People's Opposition Party,"" while the reference translation correctly identifies Samak Sundaravej as the ""chairman of the People's Power Party.""
4. The reference translation also adds the crucial information that the People's Power Party is the one that won the elections, which is not explicitly mentioned in the machine translation.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in identifying Samak Sundaravej as the chairman of the People's Power Party instead of the President of the People's Opposition Party, and in not specifying that the People's Power Party is the victorious party.

|reference translation|: The three-day trainig exercise of the Defence League, Orkaan 2014, commenced in Saaremaa.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Source**: The source text mentions ""Saaremaal"" (on the island of Saaremaa) and ""Kaitseliidu"" (Defence League), as well as the event ""kolmepäevane suurõppus"" (three-day training exercise) and the specific name ""Orkaan 2014"".

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Saaremaal"" to ""on the island of the island"", which is redundant and does not convey the intended location. It also omits the name of the organization, ""Kaitseliidu"", and instead uses ""the Union for Defence"", which is not a direct translation.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation correctly translates ""Saaremaal"" to ""in Saaremaa"" and keeps the name of the organization as ""Defence League"". It also maintains the correct structure for the event, ""three-day training exercise"" and the name ""Orkaan 2014"".

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation has several differences from the reference translation, including:
- Incorrect or redundant phrasing for the location (Saaremaa vs. ""on the island of the island"").
- Omission of the specific organization name (Kaitseliidu vs. the Union for Defence).

- The machine translation uses ""grass-roots disease"" instead of ""juurehaigus"" (root disease), which is a direct translation error.
- The machine translation says ""reached growth"" instead of ""jõudis kasvandustesse"" (reached the growth stage or farms), which is a misinterpretation of the source text. The correct meaning is that the disease affected the growth of trees, not that it reached a stage of growth itself.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- Difference 1: Incorrect translation of ""juurehaigus"" to ""grass-roots disease.""
- Difference 2: Incorrect interpretation of ""jõudis kasvandustesse"" as ""reached growth"" instead of ""reached the farms"" or ""affected the growth of trees.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation due to the incorrect translation of ""juurehaigus"" and the misinterpretation of the phrase ""jõudis kasvandustesse."" The machine translation should be revised to say ""In 1936, the root disease spreading on local trees reached the farms.""

Step 1: Identify the main subject and action
Source: Chris Dreja (subject) on meenutanud (action)
Machine translation: Mr Chris Dreja (subject) has reminded us (action)
Reference translation: Chris Dreja (subject) has recollected (action)

Step 2: Compare the roles and titles
Source: Yardbirdsi rütmikitarrist (Yardbirds' rhythm guitarist)
Machine translation: the rhythm of YardBurmese (misinterpretation, should be the Yardbirds' rhythm guitarist)
Reference translation: the rhythm guitarist of the Yardbirds

Step 3: Analyze the context of the guitar incident
Source: kitarrikeel purunes (a guitar string broke)
Machine translation: plastic language broke (incorrect, should be related to a guitar string)
Reference translation: a guitar string broke

Step 4: Compare the description of Clapton's departure
Source: ei lahkunud kunagi lavalt (never left the scene)
Machine translation: never left the scene (accurate)
Reference translation: never left the stage

Step 5: Overall evaluation
The machine translation has several inaccuracies, including the incorrect interpretation of Chris Dreja's role as the ""rhythm of YardBurmese"" instead of the Yardbirds' rhythm guitarist, and the misinterpretation of ""kitarrikeel purunes"" as ""plastic language broke."" The reference translation accurately captures the subject, action, and context of the guitar incident, while the machine translation fails to do so. The description of Clapton's departure is correct in both, but the overall quality is lower due to the errors in the guitar-related part.

Step 1: Identify key terms and phrases
- ""Uus õiguskantsler"" (new Chancellor of Justice)
- ""pidi ametisse astuma"" (was due to take office)
- ""9. märtsil"" (9th of March)
- ""lükkus"" (postponed)
- ""Riigikogu valimiste periood"" (election period for the Riigikogu)

Step 2: Compare machine translation to source and reference translation
- Machine translation: ""The new Secretary of Justice"" (refers to Chancellor of Justice, but uses ""Secretary"")
- Machine translation: ""was due to take office on 9 March"" (accurate)
- Machine translation: ""but it was postponed to 31 March"" (accurate)
- Machine translation: ""due to the election period for the State"" (refers to ""Riigikogu"" but uses ""State"")

Step 3: Analyze differences
- Difference 1: ""Secretary of Justice"" vs ""Chancellor of Justice"" - The machine translation uses ""Secretary"" instead of the more accurate ""Chancellor"" in the context of Estonian.
- Difference 2: ""State"" vs ""Riigikogu"" - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Riigikogu valimiste periood"" as ""the election period for the State,"" which should be ""Riigikogu"" (the Estonian parliament).

Conclusion: The machine translation has differences in the title of the position (""Secretary"" instead of ""Chancellor"") and the specific entity referred to (""State"" instead of ""Riigikogu""). The reference translation is more accurate in these aspects.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""1903. aastal hakkas Tartus ilmuma ka Peeter Speegi ajaleht Uudised, mis oli Teatajast veel radikaalsem ja toetas sotsiaaldemokraatiat.""
- Machine translation: ""In 1933, Peeter Speeter's newspaper, which was even more radical than the Official Journal and supported social democracy, began to appear in Tartu.""

Difference: The machine translation incorrectly states the year as 1933 instead of 1903, which is the correct year according to the source.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""In 1933, Peeter Speeter's newspaper, which was even more radical than the Official Journal and supported social democracy, began to appear in Tartu.""
- Reference translation: ""In 1903, Peeter Speek started to publish his newspaper, "" Uudised "", in Tartu, which was even more radical than "" Teataja "" and supported social democracy.""

Difference: The name of the newspaper is translated differently. In the machine translation, it's ""Peeter Speeter's newspaper"" while in the reference it's ""Peeter Speek started to publish his newspaper, 'Uudised'."" The reference also specifies the name of the competing newspaper as ""Teataja,"" which is not included in the machine translation.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the year and the specific details about the newspaper. The correct evaluation would be that the machine translation is of lower quality due to these inaccuracies.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Identify the main subject and action in the source text
- Main subject: Ungari värvatud (Hungarian paints)
- Action: tagasilööke (setbacks)

Step 2: Compare the main subject in the machine translation
- Machine translation: Hungary's paints
- Reference translation: The Hungarian recruits

Difference: The machine translation refers to ""Hungary's paints"" instead of ""Hungarian recruits"" as the subject. This is a significant difference because ""recruits"" would be more appropriate in the context of a military situation, while ""paints"" are unrelated to causing setbacks.

Step 3: Compare the action in the machine translation
- Machine translation: also caused numerous small setbacks to the priests
- Reference translation: also caused numerous small setbacks to the Prussians

Difference: The machine translation mentions ""priests"" instead of ""Prussians."" This is a major error, as the context suggests a military context, where ""Prussians"" would be the correct recipients of the setbacks, not priests.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of the subject (recruits vs. paints) and the recipients of the setbacks (Prussians vs. priests). The correct translation should be closer to the reference, which attributes the setbacks to Hungarian recruits and their impact on the Prussians.

|Machine translation: Since different people are making different things happy, making non-monopogamy possible is likely to increase the overall happiness.|
|Reference translation: Since different things make different happy, making non-monogamy possible is likely to increase overall happiness.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text starts with ""Et erinevaid inimesi"" which translates to ""Since different people"" in both the machine and reference translations. This part is correctly translated.
2. The phrase ""teevad õnnelikuks erinevad asjad"" is translated as ""are making different things happy"" in the machine translation, which is accurate but worded slightly differently than the reference (""make different happy""). The meaning is the same, but the reference uses a more concise structure.
3. The main point ""suurendab tõenäoliselt üleüldist õnne"" is translated as ""increase the overall happiness"" in both, which is a correct translation.

The main difference between the machine and reference translations is the structure of the phrase ""teevad õnnelikuks erinevad asjad."" The machine translation uses a more complex structure with ""are making different things happy,"" while the reference translation is simpler with ""make different happy."" Despite this, the meaning is preserved in both.

Overall, the machine translation is of good quality, with only a minor difference in phrasing that does not significantly alter the meaning. The main ideas are accurately conveyed, and the translation is coherent.

First, let's compare the source text with the machine translation:

1. ""Lillede ja loomade nautimine"" (enjoyment of flowers and animals) - The machine translation has ""chickens"" instead of ""flowers."" This is a significant difference, as the source text specifically mentions flowers, not chickens.

2. ""on nii ilmselt hea"" (is obviously so good) - The translation is accurate here.

3. ""et inimesed, kes seda teevad"" (that the people who do so) - The translation is correct.

4. ""võivad isegi imestada"" (may even be surprised) - The translation is accurate.

5. ""et sellel on midagi pistmist voorusega"" (that it has something to do with virtues) - The translation is correct, but it omits the word ""voorusega"" (virtues) from the source, which might slightly change the emphasis.

Now, let's compare the machine translation with the reference translation:

1. ""The enjoyment of chickens and animals"" (ref) vs ""The enjoyment of flowers and animals"" (machine) - The difference here is the inclusion of ""flowers"" in the reference translation, which is not present in the machine translation.

2. ""is obviously so good"" (ref) = ""on nii ilmselt hea"" (machine) - The meaning is the same.

3. ""that the people who do so"" (ref) = ""et inimesed, kes seda teevad"" (machine) - The translation is accurate.

4. ""may even be surprised"" (ref) = ""võivad isegi imestada"" (machine) - The meaning is the same.

5. ""that it has something to do with virtues"" (ref) = ""that it has something to do with virtues"" (machine) - The translation is the same, but the reference adds the word ""virtues"" which is not in the machine translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation has a significant error in translating ""Lillede"" (flowers) as ""chickens,"" which changes the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text, with the exception of the word ""voorusega"" (virtues) being omitted in the machine translation. The overall quality of the translation could be improved by including ""flowers"" and maintaining the emphasis on virtues.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Podolski vapp on registreeritud Venemaa Föderatsiooni riiklikus heraldikaregistris numbri 1801 all.""
- Machine translation: ""Podolski's knip is registered in the national heralphorus register of the Russian Federation under number 1801.""

Step 2: Identify differences in vocabulary and structure.
- ""vapp"" (coat of arms) is translated as ""knip"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect.
- ""registreeritud"" (registered) is translated as ""is registered"" in the machine translation, which is a correct grammatical structure.
- ""Venemaa Föderatsiooni"" (Russian Federation) is translated as ""Russian Federation"" in the machine translation, which is accurate.
- ""riiklikus heraldikaregistris"" (national heraldry register) is translated as ""national heralphorus register"" in the machine translation, with a slight error in the word ""heralphorus.""

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: ""The Podolsk coat of arms is registered in the national heraldry register of the Russian Federation under number 1801.""

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The main difference is the translation of ""vapp"" to ""coat of arms"" in the reference translation, which is more accurate than ""knip.""
- The reference translation also uses ""coat of arms"" instead of ""heralphorus register,"" which is a more precise term for the context.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some inaccuracies, particularly in the term ""knip"" instead of ""coat of arms"" and the use of ""heralphorus register"" instead of ""national heraldry register.""

1. **Source**: Kui ta seda viimast ei oleks, siis oleks tal teistsugune suhe praktikaga üldse.
   - In the source text, ""seda viimast"" refers to ""the latter"" and ""üldse"" means ""at all"" or ""generally"".

2. **Machine translation**: If it did not have the latter, it would have a different relationship with practice at all.
   - The machine translation correctly captures the idea that the lack of ""the latter"" would result in a different relationship with practice, but it omits the word ""üldse"" which is crucial for conveying the full meaning of ""at all"" or ""entirely"".

3. **Reference translation**: If he was not the latter, he would have an entirely different relationship with practice.
   - The reference translation uses ""he was not the latter"" to clarify the context, which is missing in the machine translation. Additionally, ""entirely"" is a more precise translation of ""üldse"" in this context, emphasizing the complete difference.

**Analysis**: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in two main ways:
- It does not include the word ""üldse"" or its equivalent, which is important for conveying the full extent of the difference.
- It does not specify ""he"" as the subject, which is implied in the source text but not explicitly stated in the machine translation.

To improve the quality, the machine translation could be revised to: ""If it were not the latter, it would have an entirely different relationship with practice."" This version includes ""üldse"" and maintains the clarity of the reference translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Julge oletuse kinnitamine toob kaasa taustteadmise mingi osa falsifitseerimise.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Approval of a flagrant assumption will lead to some kind of 'declassification' of the background.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Affirmation of a bold assumption results in falsification of certain part of background knowledge.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- ""Julge oletuse kinnitamine"" (Approval of a flagrant assumption) is translated as ""Approval of a flagrant assumption"" in the machine translation. The source text uses ""kinnitamine"" (affirmation) which is a more accurate term for the context, as it implies a stronger agreement or acceptance, while ""approval"" is more general.
- ""toob kaasa"" (brings along) is translated as ""will lead to"" in the machine translation, which is a reasonable interpretation but loses the nuance of the source, which suggests a direct connection or consequence.
- ""taustteadmise mingi osa"" (some part of background knowledge) is translated as ""some kind of 'declassification' of the background"" in the machine translation. The term ""declassification"" is not a direct translation and does not convey the idea of falsification or misrepresentation of background knowledge, which is the intended meaning.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text by using ""affirmation"" instead of ""approval"" and ""falsification of certain part of background knowledge"" instead of ""declassification.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the choice of words and the specific meaning conveyed. The machine translation loses the nuance of the source text, particularly in the description of the consequence and the term used for the background knowledge. The reference translation provides a more accurate and precise translation that reflects the original Estonian meaning.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.

- Machine translation: ""If fjords and others are not taken into account, the coastline is 2650 km or 2532 km.""

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, which is about the coastline length not considering fjords and other features. However, there's a difference in the way the term ""lahti"" is translated. In Estonian, ""lahti"" can refer to both ""fjords"" and ""bays"" but the machine translation uses ""others"" which is a more general term.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""If fjords and others are not taken into account, the coastline is 2650 km or 2532 km.""
- Reference translation: ""If fjords and other bays are not taken into account, the coastline is 2650 km or 2532 km.""

The reference translation specifies ""other bays"" instead of ""others,"" which provides a clearer context for what is being excluded from the coastline measurement.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the choice of words for ""lahti."" The reference translation specifies ""other bays,"" which is more precise and consistent with the source text, while the machine translation uses ""others,"" which could potentially include a broader range of features.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""the strain will be brought up,"" which is a literal translation of ""tüli üles"" but does not convey the intended meaning of a conflict or argument (""quarrel"" in the reference).
- The reference translation uses ""greeted"" and ""as well"" to convey the sense of Jane joining in the situation, while the machine translation omits this context.
- The machine translation adds ""however"" which is not present in the source text and does not significantly change the meaning but adds a tone that is not clear from the source.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the interpretation of the phrase ""tüli üles"" and the context of Jane's arrival, which results in a less accurate translation of the source text.

**Source:** Ma tegin täpselt samuti nagu Markii de Sade, kes annab kõikidele tegelastele vanuses.
**Machine Translation:** I did just like Markii de Sade, who gives the age of all the figures.
**Reference Translation:** I did just like Marquis de Sade, who gives an age to all characters.

**Analysis:**

1. **Noun agreement**: In the source text, ""vanuses"" is the genitive form of ""vanus"" (age), which is used to indicate possession or the attribute of characters. The machine translation uses ""the age of all the figures,"" which is a direct translation but omits the genitive form, making it sound like the figures are objects with ages rather than characters.

2. **Proper noun translation**: The source text refers to ""Markii de Sade"" with a possessive form, indicating it's a specific person's name. The machine translation correctly translates this as ""Markii de Sade,"" but the reference translation changes it to ""Marquis de Sade,"" which is the more common and correct way to refer to the historical figure in English. The difference is minor but important for clarity.

3. **Verb tense and structure**: Both the machine and reference translations use the same tense and structure, which is appropriate for the context.

4. **Omission of a comma**: The reference translation includes a comma after ""Marquis de Sade,"" which is not present in the machine translation. This comma is not strictly necessary in English, but it can help to clarify the sentence structure and separate the two clauses.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the genitive form of ""vanus"" (age), the use of ""Marquis"" instead of ""Markii"" (which is a minor error), and the inclusion of a comma. The overall meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is more grammatically accurate and idiomatic in English.

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
- Source: Nkayas lahkneb sellest itta suunduv liin, mis viib Nayuchi kaudu Nacala sadamasse Mosambiigi rannikul.
- Machine translation: In Nkaya, this route to the East is being dissociated from it, leading to the port of Nacala on the coast of Mozambique via Nayuchi.
- Reference translation: An eastward line branches off at Nkaya, leading to the port of Nacala on the coast of Mozambique via Nayuchi.

The source sentence starts with ""Nkayas lahkneb"" (Nkaya is branching off), while the machine translation and reference translation both start with ""In Nkaya"" and ""An eastward line branches off at Nkaya,"" respectively. The source sentence uses ""sellest itta suunduv liin"" (a line going in that direction) to describe the route, while the machine translation rephrases it as ""this route to the East"" and the reference translation as ""an eastward line.""

Step 2: Check for meaning preservation
- The source mentions ""liin, mis viib Nayuchi kaudu Nacala sadamasse"" (a line that goes through Nayuchi to Nacala port), which is translated to ""leading to the port of Nacala on the coast of Mozambique via Nayuchi"" in both the machine and reference translations. The meaning is preserved.

Step 3: Evaluate differences
- The main difference is the way the source sentence starts with ""Nkayas lahkneb"" (Nkaya is branching off), while the translations start with ""In Nkaya"" and ""An eastward line branches off at Nkaya."" This is a minor difference in phrasing, but the overall meaning is the same.

- The machine translation uses ""dissociated from it"" which might imply a separation or detachment, but the source does not convey this sense of separation. The reference translation uses ""branches off,"" which is a more accurate and neutral term for describing the action.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the sentence structure and a slightly different interpretation of the source's ""it"" (which might be implied in the reference translation). The meaning is mostly preserved, but the reference translation is clearer and more faithful to the original Estonian text.

Analysis:
1. The source text uses ""annab"" (gives) which is translated as ""will produce"" in the machine translation, which is a suitable verb to convey the idea of an experiment yielding a result. However, the reference translation uses ""produce"" which is a more common and concise term for this context.
2. The machine translation uses ""put the result"" which is not idiomatic in English. The reference translation uses ""make the result"" which is more accurate and natural, as it implies the act of confirming a theory based on the outcome.
3. The machine translation includes ""our theories"" with an article ""the"", while the reference translation omits the article, which is correct since ""theories"" is plural and should not be preceded by an article in this context.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of verb choice, the way ""result"" is connected to the action of confirming theories, and the article usage for ""theories."" The machine translation could be improved by using ""An experiment"" instead of ""The test"" for better clarity, removing the article from ""our theories,"" and using ""make"" instead of ""put"" to align more closely with the reference translation.

Source: Plaani vastu olid kohalikud vasallid, kes kartsid, et uus maahärra kärbib nende seniseid laialdasi õigusi.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The plan was opposed by local copies who feared that their extensive rights would be curtailed by the new rural Mr.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The plan was opposed by local vassals who feared that the new landlord would curtail their extensive rights.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- Differences in vocabulary:
   - ""kohalikud vasallid"" (local vassals) vs ""local copies"" (imprecise, ""copies"" does not convey the feudal relationship)
   - ""maahärra"" (landlord) vs ""new rural Mr."" (less specific, ""Mr."" is not necessary in this context)

- Differences in sentence structure:
   - The machine translation inserts ""who feared"" after ""local copies,"" which is not present in the source text. In the reference translation, it is more natural to place ""who feared"" after ""local vassals.""

- Differences in meaning:
   - ""seniseid laialdasi õigusi"" (their extensive rights) is translated as ""their extensive rights would be curtailed,"" which conveys the same idea but with a slightly different phrasing.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of vocabulary choice (using ""local copies"" instead of ""local vassals"") and sentence structure (inserting ""who feared"" in a different position). The core meaning is similar, but the reference translation is more accurate in conveying the feudal context and the relationship between the vassals and the new landlord.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start| Source: Igatahes oleks elu ilma armastuseta talumatult vormitu ja tühi.
|mt_start| Machine translation: In any case, life without love would be unbearable in form and empty.
|ref_start| Reference translation: In any case, life without love would be unbearably formless and empty.

|comparison| The machine translation captures the general idea that life without love would be difficult to bear, but there are differences in the specific wording:

1. ""unbearable in form"" in the MT is translated as ""unbearable in form and empty"" in the reference. The reference omits ""and empty,"" which might be an attempt to simplify the sentence or avoid redundancy.

2. ""talumatult vormitu"" in the source is translated as ""formless"" in the reference. The machine translation adds ""and empty"" after ""formless,"" which is not directly present in the source. The reference conveys the same concept using a single word.

3. ""tühi"" in the source is translated as ""empty"" in both the machine and reference translations, but the reference omits the conjunction ""and"" before it, making the sentence structure slightly different.

Overall, the machine translation is quite close in meaning but loses some nuance and sentence structure compared to the reference. The reference translation is more concise and faithful to the original Estonian text.

|Machine translation: The four-hour crisis situation ended at 15.15 when the man shot himself and then taken to hospital.|
|Reference translation: The four-hour crisis situation ended at 15 : 15 when the man shot himself and was then taken to hospital.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""kell 15.15"" (15:15) to indicate the time, but the machine translation omits the colon, resulting in ""15.15"" which is less clear without the context of clock hours.
2. The machine translation includes ""and then taken to hospital"" after ""shot himself,"" while the reference translation uses ""was then taken to hospital"" to maintain a more natural and passive voice. The reference translation is clearer in this regard.
3. The reference translation uses ""shot himself"" in the past tense, which is more appropriate for the context of a past event, while the machine translation does not specify the tense.

Overall, the machine translation has a few differences in clarity and tense compared to the reference translation. The main issues are the lack of the colon in the time reference and the absence of the past tense in the action of shooting himself. The reference translation provides a more accurate and natural representation of the source text.

|Source: Kas on nauditavaid vaimuseisundeid, mille suhtes meil on ebasoodne hoiak sõltumatult nende tagajärgedest?|
|Machine translation: Are there any enjoyable spirits, on which we have an unfavourable attitude independently of their consequences?|
|Reference translation: Are there any pleasurable mental states, towards which we have an unfavourable attitude independently of their consequences?|

|Analysis|
1. **""nauditavaid vaimuseisundeid""** (enjoyable spirits) - The machine translation uses ""spirits"" which might be a literal translation of ""vaimuseisundeid"" but in this context, it refers to mental states, not actual spirits. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""pleasurable mental states.""
2. **""mille suhtes""** (with respect to which) - The machine translation has ""on which"" which is a valid way to express the relationship, but it's less idiomatic than ""mille suhtes"" in Estonian.
3. **""ebasoodne hoiak""** (unfavourable attitude) - Both translations capture this concept accurately.
4. **""sõltumatult nende tagajärgedest""** (independently of their consequences) - The machine translation has this phrase, but it's slightly awkward in English. The reference translation keeps the same meaning but with a more natural phrasing.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation has some minor differences in terms of word choice and phrasing, which affect the clarity and idiomaticity of the sentence. The main idea is conveyed, but the reference translation is more accurate and natural in English. The differences mainly lie in the interpretation of ""vaimuseisundeid"" and the phrasing of the relationship to the consequences.|im_end|

|Machine translation: A car bomb exploded near the Somali capital, Muqdishos Wehliye hotel.|
|Reference translation: A car bomb exploded near the Muqdishos Wehliye hotel in the Somali capital.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""Somaalia pealinnas"" (Somali capital), which is translated as ""the Somali capital"" in both the machine and reference translations. This part is consistent.
2. The source specifies ""Muqdishos Wehliye hotelli lähistel"" (near the Muqdishos Wehliye hotel), which is translated as ""Muqdishos Wehliye hotel"" in the machine translation and ""the Muqdishos Wehliye hotel"" in the reference translation. The reference adds ""in the"" to provide more context, but the meaning is essentially the same.
3. The machine translation adds a comma after ""Muqdishos Wehliye hotel"" which is not present in the source or reference. This is a minor difference that does not affect the overall meaning.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in punctuation. The main information about the location of the car bomb is consistent with the reference translation. The reference translation provides a slightly clearer and more grammatically complete sentence by including ""in the"" to indicate the capital, but the core meaning is the same.

|Reference translation: In Estonia, Aivar Sõerd, former Minister of Finance, took office as the CEO of the Tallink Hotels chain.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""hotelliketi"" (hotel chain), but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""Hotel"" without specifying it as a chain.
2. The machine translation refers to the person as ""Mr Hotels,"" which is a misinterpretation and does not match the reference translation, where it's ""Aivar Sõerd.""
3. The reference translation correctly identifies Aivar Sõerd as the ""former Minister of Finance,"" while the machine translation incorrectly names him as ""Mr Ahanr War.""

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Need pingutused jäävad ühe ja sama uurimisprogrammi raamesse.
Machine translation: These efforts remain within the framework of the same research programme.

Step 2: Identify differences in word choice and structure.
- ""Need pingutused"" (These efforts) is correctly translated.
- ""jäävad"" (remain) is also accurately translated.
- ""ühe ja sama"" (the same) is translated as ""the same"" in both, which is correct.
- ""uurimisprogrammi"" (research programme) is translated correctly.
- ""raamesse"" (within the framework) is translated as ""of the framework"", which is a common way to express the same idea in English.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The only difference is the preposition ""raamesse"" which is translated as ""of the framework"" in the machine translation. This is a minor difference, as ""within"" is also commonly used to convey the idea of something being contained within a specific context.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality and captures the essence of the source text. The main difference is a minor choice of preposition, but both ""within"" and ""of the framework"" convey the same meaning. Overall, the translation is accurate and faithful to the original.

|Reference translation: In the 11th century, most of the existing strongholds were left behind and new ones were built that were much bigger and more secure.|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation uses ""cities"" (cities) while the reference translation uses ""strongholds"" (linnustest). This is a difference in terminology, as strongholds are more historically accurate for the context of the time period mentioned, which is typically associated with fortified structures.
2. The machine translation omits the word ""senistest"" (old) from the source, which is important to convey that the existing structures were not just any, but old ones.
3. The phrase ""tugevamini kindlustatud"" in the source means ""more securely established"" or ""more securely fortified."" The machine translation simply uses ""more secure,"" which might lose the nuance of the original Estonian, as ""kindlustatud"" implies a stronger emphasis on the security aspect.

Overall, the machine translation is accurate in terms of conveying the general idea but loses some historical accuracy and nuance by translating ""linnustest"" as ""cities"" and not including the word ""senistest."" The reference translation better captures the original meaning and context.

**Analysis:**

1. **Length and description of Glåma**: In the source text, ""601 km pikkune"" (601 km long) is a clear description of the river's length. The machine translation omits this description, simply stating ""601 km of Glåma"" which is less precise.

2. **Flow direction**: The source text specifies that Glåma ""suubub"" (flows) near Fredrikstad. The machine translation omits this information, leaving the reader unsure about the river's direction.

3. **River's connection to the fjord**: The source text clearly states that Glåma flows ""Fredrikstadi lähedal"" (near Fredrikstad) into the Oslo fjord. The machine translation incorrectly refers to the fjord as being ""near Fredrikstad"" without specifying the river's connection to it.

4. **Structure and grammar**: The reference translation maintains the original sentence structure and grammar, while the machine translation has a more fragmented structure, making it less natural and clear.

In conclusion, the machine translation is lacking in detail, flow direction, and sentence structure compared to the reference translation.

3. **Reference translation**: The corpuscular paradigm brought a new problem and, to a large extent, its solution.

**Analysis**:

- **""Korpuskulaarne"" vs. ""multidimensional""**: The machine translation uses ""multidimensional"" which is a different concept than the source's ""korpuskulaarne"" (corpuscular in English). The reference translation correctly translates this term as ""corpuscular.""
- **""tõi"" vs. ""brought""**: Both translations use the correct past tense form of ""bring"" in English, but the source uses the Estonian verb ""tõi"" which is translated as ""brought"" in both.
- **""uue probleemi"" vs. ""a new problem""**: The meaning is the same, but the word order is slightly different. The machine translation is correct.
- **""ja suuresti selle lahenduse"" vs. ""and, to a large extent, a solution""**: The machine translation captures the idea of ""suuresti"" (to a large extent) and ""selle lahenduse"" (its solution) but rephrases it as ""and, to a large extent, a solution.""

Machine translation: However, if it is directed against its own central parts, which it considers impossible to make possible, or against everything, it may lead to self-destruction.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- The machine translation uses ""make possible"" instead of ""muutmist"" (change).
- The machine translation omits the comma after ""vastu"" in ""mille muutmist ei peeta võimalikuks"".

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: See ei ole leppimine, kui see tuleb andestaja ausast usust, et amoraalne tegu ei ole hea tõend tegija hinge kohta.
Machine translation: It is not reconciliation when it comes to the honest belief of the forgive that an amoral act is not good evidence of the perpetrator's soul.

Step 2: Identify differences in structure and word choice.
- ""See ei ole leppimine"" (It is not reconciliation) is translated as ""It is not reconciliation"", which is a direct translation but lacks the emphasis on the negation in the original.
- ""kui see tuleb"" (when it comes) is translated as ""when it comes to"", which is a similar expression but omits the original emphasis on the arrival or occurrence of something.
- ""andestaja ausast usust"" (the honest belief of the forgive) is translated as ""the honest belief of the forgive"", where ""andestaja"" (forgiver) is not directly translated and ""ausast usust"" (honest faith) is slightly rephrased.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: It is not reconciliation if it comes from the forgiving honest faith that an amoral act is not good evidence of the perpetrator 's soul.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation adds the possessive apostrophe to ""forgiving"" to indicate it belongs to the forgiver, which is missing in the machine translation.
- The reference translation rephrases ""ausast usust"" as ""honest faith"" to better match the English structure and convey the same meaning.

Machine translation: However, the Kuhn Paper also talks about subjective knowledge, namely when it comes to the exchange of views.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- The source text uses ""raamatus"" (book) while the machine translation uses ""Paper"", which might be a misinterpretation or a simplification.
- The source text uses ""geštaldivahetusest"" (gestalt change) while the machine translation has ""exchange of views"", which is a different concept.

1. Both translations have the same structure and convey the same meaning: ""He called for an end to violence in Africa on 25 December 2008.""
2. The source text uses ""Ta"" (He/She) which is not explicitly included in the machine translation, but it is implied by the context and can be inferred from the reference translation. In English, it is often left out when referring to a generic subject.
3. The punctuation and capitalization are identical in both translations, which is correct.

|im_start| Step 5: Identify any differences or errors|
The only difference is that the machine translation does not include the word ""Ta"" (He/She), but this is a minor omission that does not affect the overall meaning.

|im_end| Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality, with only a minor grammatical difference (omission of ""Ta""). The meaning and context are accurately conveyed, and the structure and punctuation are correct. The main difference is a stylistic choice, not a translation error.|

|Machine translation: The security man stayed at the door used teargas balloons against the aggressors and gave way to space.|
|Reference translation: A security guard standing in front of the building door used a tear gas canister against the attackers and retreated to the room.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Hoone ukse ees""** (in front of the building door) is translated as ""at the door"" in the machine translation, which is less specific and omits the ""building"" part.
2. **""turvamees""** (security guard) is correctly translated, but the word order is changed, making it less clear in the machine translation.
3. **""kasutas ründajate vastu""** (used against the attackers) is translated as ""used teargas balloons against the aggressors"", which is accurate but the phrasing is awkward and doesn't convey the action of using the tear gas specifically.
4. **""pisargaasiballooni""** (teargas balloons) is translated as ""teargas balloons"", which is a direct translation but might be less common or precise in English, as it's more common to refer to tear gas canisters.
5. **""ning taandus ruumi""** (and retreated to the room) is translated as ""and gave way to space"", which is not an accurate translation, as ""taandus"" means ""retreated"" and ""ruumi"" means ""room"", not ""space"".

Machine translation: By July, half Estonia was under the control of German troops.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: By July, half of Estonia was under the control of German troops.

Step 4: Compare the differences
1. The machine translation uses ""pool Eestit"" which is a direct translation of ""half Estonia"" but it is not idiomatic in English. The reference translation uses ""half of Estonia"" which is a more natural and precise way to express the same idea.
2. The machine translation omits the article ""the"" before ""German troops,"" while the reference translation includes it. In English, it is common to use ""the"" when referring to specific groups or entities, like ""German troops.""

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of phrasing and the use of the definite article ""the."" The reference translation is more natural and idiomatic in English, while the machine translation could be improved by using ""half of Estonia"" and including the article ""the.""

|Machine Translation| Justinianus II tried to break the urban cartocracy by imposing heavy taxes and by-persons on key positions of the administrative system.|
|Reference Translation| Justinianus II tried to break the urban aristocrats by imposing heavy taxes and appointing outsiders to key positions in the administrative system.|

Analysis:

1. **""linnaaristokraate murda""** (murdering urban aristocrats) vs. **""urban cartocracy""** (breaking the urban aristocracy): The machine translation uses ""cartocracy"" which is a term typically associated with a hereditary or oligarchic system of government, while the reference translation specifies ""urban aristocrats"" as the target. The source text does not explicitly mention ""cartocracy"" but implies the destruction of a powerful group, which is more accurately translated as ""aristocrats.""

2. **""kõrvaliste isikute määramisega""** (with the appointment of peripheral individuals) vs. **""by-persons""** and **""appointing outsiders""**: The machine translation uses ""by-persons"" which is not a standard term in English and does not convey the idea of outsiders being appointed. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""appointing outsiders,"" which indicates that Justinian was bringing in people from outside the existing power structure.

3. **""tähtsamatele kohtadele""** (to key positions) is accurately translated in both the machine and reference translations.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""linnaaristokraate murda"" and the handling of ""kõrvaliste isikute määramisega,"" which affects the understanding of Justinian's strategy. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Ajakirjanik Alistair Cooke on öelnud, et professionaal on see, kes teeb oma tööd maksimaalselt hästi ka siis, kui tal pole selleks tuju.
Machine translation: The journalist, Alistair Cooke, has said that it is the professional who does his job as well as possible when he does not have the wind to do so.

Step 2: Identify differences in meaning or phrasing.
- In the source, ""on öelnud"" (has said) is translated as ""has said"" in the machine translation, which is correct.
- ""professionaal"" (professional) is translated accurately.
- ""kes teeb oma tööd maksimaalselt hästi"" (who does his job as well as possible) is translated as ""who does his job as well as possible"", which conveys a similar meaning but omits the phrase ""kui tal pole selleks tuju"" (when he does not have the mood).

Step 3: Analyze the difference in the phrase ""kui tal pole selleks tuju"" (when he does not have the mood).
- The machine translation uses ""when he does not have the wind to do so"" which is a literal translation of ""kui tal pole tuju"" but does not convey the same meaning as ""mood"" in the context of doing a job.

Step 4: Conclusion.
The machine translation captures the essence of Alistair Cooke's statement but loses the nuance of the original Estonian by translating ""tuju"" as ""wind"" instead of ""mood."" The reference translation more accurately reflects the idea that a professional does their job to the best of their ability even when they're not in the right frame of mind.

Source: Väga edukad olid 1936. aasta suveolümpiamängud Berliinis.
Machine translation: The 1936 summer Olympic Games in Berlin were very successful.

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, which is that the 1936 summer Olympics in Berlin were successful. However, there is a difference in the translation of the adverb ""väga"" (very) and the word order.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: The 1936 summer Olympic Games in Berlin were very successful.
Reference translation: The 1936 summer Olympic Games in Berlin were very successful.

The reference translation is identical to the machine translation, except for the inclusion of a period at the end. The period is a minor difference, as it is common to have a period at the end of a sentence in English, even though it is not always present in other languages.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with the main message being conveyed correctly. The difference lies in the adverb ""väga"" being translated as ""very"" and the absence of a period at the end. The core meaning is the same as the reference translation, but the word order and punctuation are slightly different. Overall, the quality of the translation is good, but it could be improved by maintaining the original word order and including the period for a more natural-sounding English sentence.

|Reference translation: The judges of the Egyptian Appeal Courts began a strike in protest against the actions of President Muḩammad Mursī.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""Egiptuse apellatsioonikohtute"" (Egyptian Appeal Courts), which is correctly translated as ""the Egyptian Appeal Courts"" in both the machine and reference translations.
2. The machine translation has an error in the name of the president, ""MuPeammad Mursursu"" instead of ""Muḩammad Mursī"". This is a significant difference, as it changes the proper noun and might lead to confusion about the president's identity.
3. The rest of the sentence structure is similar in both translations, with ""alustasid protestiks"" (began a strike in protest) and ""tegevuse vastu"" (against the actions) being accurately translated.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the proper name of the president, ""MuPeammad Mursursu"" instead of ""Muḩammad Mursī"".

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
Both the machine translation and the reference translation have a similar sentence structure, with the year ""2000"" at the beginning, followed by the percentage ""around 52%"" and the description ""of the population were illiterate.""

Step 2: Check for word-for-word translation
The words ""2000"", ""around"", ""52%"", ""of the population"", and ""illiterate"" are all accurately translated in the machine translation.

Step 3: Analyze differences
The only difference between the two translations is the presence of a comma after ""2000"" in the reference translation. In English, it is common to use a comma to separate the year from the rest of the sentence, especially when providing additional context or a pause. The machine translation omits this comma.

Step 4: Evaluate impact on meaning
The absence of the comma does not change the core meaning of the sentence, but it does make the reference translation slightly more grammatically correct and easier to read in English.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with the main difference being the lack of a comma after the year. The overall meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is more in line with standard English punctuation. The quality of the translation can be considered high, but with a minor improvement in terms of punctuation.

- The source text uses ""too"" which means ""also"" in Estonian, while the machine translation uses ""when the child was involved"" to convey the same meaning. This is a slightly different phrasing.
- The source text uses ""kui too oli laps"" which means ""when he was a child"" in English, while the machine translation omits ""a"" before ""child."" This is a minor difference in style.

|im_start|
The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly in line with each other, with only a slight difference in punctuation. The machine translation has a full stop after ""processes,"" while the reference translation omits it, making the sentence flow more naturally without interrupting the thought. Apart from this, both translations convey the same meaning: the need to explain human uniqueness and describe the evolutionary processes responsible for it.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. Both translations start with ""Research into the origin of human beings,"" which is identical.
2. The phrase ""needs to explain this human specificity"" is also the same in both versions.
3. The main difference lies in the description of the evolutionary processes: ""which selle esile kutsusid"" in the source text is translated to ""that brought it about"" in both machine and reference translations. The reference translation simplifies this part by using the more common English phrase, which maintains the meaning without requiring knowledge of Estonian grammar.
4. The machine translation includes a full stop after ""processes,"" while the reference translation omits it, making the sentence read more smoothly in English.

Overall, the machine translation is of good quality, with only a minor punctuation adjustment needed to match the reference translation.

|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
- Source: ""Meil on muidugi tähtis aru saada, mida moraaliprintsiibid nõuavad, toetavad ja keelavad.""
- Machine translation: ""It is, of course, important for us to understand what moral principles require, support and ban.""
- Reference translation: ""It is , of course , important for us to understand what is requireed , supported and prohibited by moral principles .""

The source sentence has a more complex structure with the verb ""nõuavad"" (require), ""toetavad"" (support), and ""keelavad"" (prohibit) all in the same clause. The machine translation has combined these into a single verb ""require, support, and ban,"" which is a simplification. The reference translation has separated these actions into ""is required,"" ""is supported,"" and ""is prohibited,"" maintaining the parallel structure.

Step 2: Check for word choice and accuracy
- Source: ""moraliprintsiibid"" (moral principles)
- Machine translation: ""moral principles""
- Reference translation: ""moral principles""

The word choice is the same in both the machine and reference translations.

Step 3: Analyze the differences
- The main difference lies in the verb construction. The machine translation combines the actions into a single verb, while the reference translation separates them into distinct phrases, which is closer to the original source structure.
- The machine translation uses ""ban"" as a single word, which is not in the source sentence. The reference translation uses ""prohibited,"" which is a more accurate translation.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its handling of the verb structure, combining the requirements, support, and prohibition into a single verb, while the reference translation separates them. Additionally, the machine translation uses ""ban"" instead of ""prohibited,"" which is a more precise term in this context.

The source text in Estonian says, ""Sellisele skeptitsismile ei saa läheneda samamoodi nagu välismaailmaskeptitsismile."" This sentence discusses two types of skepticism, one being ""sellisele skeptitsismile"" (to the skepticism of the same or internal) and the other ""välimaailmaskeptitsismile"" (global skepticism).

|im_sep| Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation states, ""Such scepticism cannot be approached in the same way as that of globalisation."" Here, the translation has changed ""sellisele skeptitsismile"" to ""that of globalisation,"" which is a misinterpretation of the original text. The machine has conflated the internal skepticism with globalisation, which is not accurate.

|im_sep| Step 3: Compare the reference translation
The reference translation correctly captures the meaning by saying, ""Such scepticism cannot be approached in the same way as the scepticism of the external world."" It maintains the distinction between the two types of skepticism, one being internal (sellisele skeptitsismile) and the other being external (välimaailmaskeptitsismile).

|im_sep| Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it incorrectly translates ""sellisele skeptitsismile"" as ""that of globalisation,"" which is a misinterpretation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start| Step 1: Identify the key elements in the source text.
- ""Kerese versioon"" (Keres version)
- ""must mängis võidule"" (the black played for a victory)
- ""näeb esmapilgul ebausutav"" (seems, at first glance, unbelievable)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the source text.
- Machine translation: ""The savage version that the black has played a victory seems, at first glance, unbelievable.""
- Source text: ""Kerese versioon, et must mängis võidule, näeb esmapilgul ebausutav.""

Step 3: Analyze differences.
- ""The savage version"" in the machine translation is not present in the source text. The source refers to ""Kerese versioon,"" which is a specific version, not necessarily savage.
- ""that the black has played a victory"" is translated as ""that the black has played a victory,"" which is a direct translation but omits the context of the game (Keres) and the initial impression (näeb esmapilgul).

Step 4: Compare with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: ""The version of Keres, that the black played for a victory, seems, at first glance, unbelievable.""
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately, including the specific version (Keres) and the initial disbelief (näeb esmapilgul).

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity (Kerese vs. savage) and the structure, which results in a less accurate representation of the source text's meaning. The reference translation better captures the context and conveys the intended message.

|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Meiesugused olendid aga, kes ängiga teadvustavad oma lõplikkust, tunnistavad üldiselt, et ei saa niisugust hoolimatut heldust endale lubada.""
- Machine translation: ""However, we like ourselves, who are aware of their finality with the game, generally recognise that such reckless generosity cannot be tolerated.""

Difference 1: The source text uses ""ängiga"" (uneasily) to describe the awareness of their finality, while the machine translation uses ""with the game"" which does not convey the same level of uneasiness or discomfort.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""However, we like ourselves, who are aware of their finality with the game, generally recognise that such reckless generosity cannot be tolerated.""
- Reference translation: ""However, beings like ourselves, who are uneasily aware of their finality, generally recognise that they cannot afford such reckless generosity.""

Difference 2: The reference translation captures the uneasiness (""uneasily aware"") that is missing in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its handling of the term ""ängiga"" (uneasily), which is crucial to convey the emotional aspect of the awareness of their finality. The reference translation more accurately reflects the original meaning and tone of the source text.

|Source: Ameerika Ühendriikides Los Angeleses toimus filminäitlejate ametiühingu Ekraaninäitlejate Gildi 2007. aasta filmiauhindade tseremoonia.|
|Machine translation: The 2007 Film Awards ceremony of Gildi, the Ekraaninstinct trade union of film-makers, was held in Los Angeles, the United States of America.|
|Reference translation: The 2007 Film Awards ceremony of the Screen Actors Guild trade union was held in Los Angeles, the United States of America.|

|Analysis|
1. **Gildi vs Screen Actors Guild**: The machine translation refers to ""Gildi, the Ekraaninstinct trade union of film-makers,"" while the reference translation specifies ""Screen Actors Guild trade union."" Gildi is likely a mistranslation or an incorrect name, as it does not correspond to the well-known Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in English.
2. **Ekraaninäitlejate vs Screen Actors**: The source text mentions ""Ekraaninäitlejate Gildi,"" which could be a typo or a less common term for ""film actors"" in Estonian. The reference translation uses ""Screen Actors Guild,"" which is a more accurate term for the union of actors in the film industry.
3. **Ametiühingu vs trade union**: Both translations use ""union,"" but the source text uses ""ametiühingu,"" which might be a less direct translation of ""trade union."" The reference translation is clearer and more standard.

In conclusion, the machine translation has differences in the name of the union (Gildi vs Screen Actors Guild), the term for film actors (Ekraaninäitlejate vs Screen Actors), and the clarity of the term ""union"" (ametiühingu vs trade union). The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original meaning.

|Machine translation: Cybernetics and society ""Norbert Wiener, a seven-page frontier, and an era mentality.""|
|Reference translation: Cybernetics and society "" seven-page foreword "" Norbert Wiener and the mentality of the era "" .|

1. **Translation of the phrase ""seitsmeleheküljelise eessõna""**: The source text refers to a ""seven-page introduction"" or ""foreword"" (seitsmeleheküljelise eessõna). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""a seven-page frontier"" which does not convey the intended meaning of an introductory text.

2. **Translation of ""Norbert Wiener ja ajastu mõttelaad""**: The source mentions Norbert Wiener, a figure, and ""ajastu mõttelaad"" which refers to the mindset or mentality of the time. The machine translation combines these into ""Norbert Wiener, an era mentality,"" which loses the connection to the specific context of the time.

3. **Structure and word order**: The reference translation maintains a clear structure, with ""seven-page foreword"" coming before ""Norbert Wiener"" and ""the mentality of the era."" The machine translation, however, combines these elements in a way that is less coherent.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the ""seitsmeleheküljelise eessõna"" as a ""frontier"" instead of an ""introduction,"" and in its presentation of Norbert Wiener and the era's mentality, which loses the connection to the context. The structure and word order are also less clear in the machine translation.

The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
1. **Proper noun translation**: The source text mentions ""Kuhni meelest,"" which refers to ""from Kuhn's point of view"" or ""in Kuhn's mind."" The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""To God's mind,"" which is unrelated to the context and does not convey the intended meaning.
2. **Omission of the possessive apostrophe**: The reference translation includes the possessive apostrophe after ""Kuhn,"" indicating that the statement is about Kuhn's perspective. The machine translation omits this apostrophe, making the subject unclear.

To evaluate the quality of the translation, the machine translation loses meaning and context by replacing ""Kuhni meelest"" with ""To God's mind"" and omitting the possessive apostrophe. The correct translation should be ""To Kuhn's mind"" to convey the intended meaning from the source text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: They will also pass through Laine, who will announce that Georg is the owner of this house.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Laine pops in at their place, announcing that it is Georg who is the owner of this house.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the machine translation, ""Nende juurest astub läbi ka Laine"" is translated as ""They will also pass through Laine,"" which omits the context of Laine arriving unexpectedly (""pops in at their place"").
- The phrase ""kes teatab"" is translated as ""who will announce,"" which is accurate but loses the nuance of Laine's action being simultaneous with the passing through (implied in ""pops in"").
- ""et hoopis Georg on selle maja omanik"" is translated as ""that Georg is the owner of this house,"" which is a direct translation but does not capture the emphasis on Georg's ownership as a fact revealed by Laine.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the context and emphasis on Laine's sudden appearance and the announcement. The reference translation provides a more natural and idiomatic way of expressing the same idea in English, capturing the essence of the original Estonian sentence.

Analysis:
1. The machine translation has an error in the word ""vulnerable"" which should be translated as ""tilapia"" in this context, referring to a type of fish. The reference translation correctly uses ""tilapia"".
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""piimkala"" (milkfish) as ""dairy fish"" and ""tiger"", which are not related to the topic of aquaculture or the fish species mentioned.
3. The structure of the sentence is also slightly different, with the machine translation placing ""coexist between dairy fish and tiger"" instead of specifying ""milkfish and tilapia"" as the coexisting species.

2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Isamaa ja Res Publica Liidu nimekirjas"" as ""the Union list of Isaland and Res Publica,"" which suggests a general list of the two political parties, while the reference translation correctly identifies it as ""Pro Patria and Res Publica Union"" list, which is a specific political union's list for the elections.

|Source: Viimane võtab Kaido kinni ja mees seletab talle, kuidas lood tegelikult on ning joonistab Ursulat jälitava inimkaubitseja pildi.|

|Reference translation: The latter detains Kaido and the man explains to him how things are actually and draws a picture of the human trafficker who is pursuing Ursula.|

|Analysis|
1. ""Viimane võtab Kaido kinni"" - Both translations correctly convey that ""the latter"" is capturing Kaido, but the machine translation uses ""the latter detain Kaido"" which is slightly awkward and implies a continuous action, while the reference translation is clearer with ""The latter detains Kaido.""
2. ""ja mees seletab talle"" - The machine translation has ""the man will explain to him,"" which suggests a future action, whereas the reference translation simply states ""the man explains to him,"" which is more natural and does not imply a future tense.
3. ""kuidas lood tegelikult on"" - Both translations are accurate, with the machine version using ""how things are actually"" and the reference using ""how things are actually.""
4. ""ning joonistab"" - The machine translation has ""and draw,"" while the reference has ""draws,"" which is more consistent with the singular subject ""the man"" in the previous clause. The machine translation implies a future action, while the reference is in the present tense.
5. ""Ursulat jälitava inimkaubitseja pildi"" - The machine translation adds ""being pursued by Ursula"" after ""human traffickers,"" which is redundant and not part of the original source. The reference translation correctly omits this and simply states ""the human trafficker who is pursuing Ursula.""

In summary, the machine translation has a few issues with tense, clarity, and redundancy, while the reference translation is more faithful to the source text. The main differences are in the phrasing of capturing Kaido, the explanation, and the description of the picture. The machine translation could be improved by removing the redundant information and maintaining a consistent tense throughout the sentence.

Step 1: Compare the time frame
- Source: ""möödunud ööpäeva"" (last night)
- Machine translation: ""last night""
- Reference translation: ""last 24 hours""

The machine translation is not as precise as the reference, as ""last night"" could refer to a single evening, while ""last 24 hours"" includes the entire previous day and night.

Step 2: Compare the verb tense
- Source: ""hukkus"" (past tense, died)
- Machine translation: ""died"" (past tense)
- Reference translation: ""died"" (past tense)

The verb tense is consistent in all three translations.

Step 3: Compare the number of soldiers
- Source: ""23 valitsusvägede sõdurit"" (23 soldiers from government forces)
- Machine translation: ""23 soldiers from government forces""
- Reference translation: ""23 soldiers of government forces""

The number of soldiers and the phrase ""government forces"" are accurately translated in all three versions.

Step 4: Overall analysis
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the time frame, which is less precise in the machine translation. However, the other elements, such as the verb tense and the description of the soldiers, are consistent. The main difference is a minor one, but it does affect the accuracy of the context.

Final evaluation: The machine translation is of decent quality, but it could be improved by specifying the time frame as ""last 24 hours"" to match the reference translation more closely.

- Machine translation: ""At the same time, Bali reached its last phase of the disease, and Raymond III was appointed as a regression instead of Guido.""

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- In the source text, ""Balduin"" is the subject, while in the machine translation, it's ""Bali"" (which seems to be a mistake, as ""Bali"" is not a proper name in this context).
- The machine translation uses ""regression"" instead of ""regendiks,"" which is the correct term for ""Regent"" in Estonian.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: ""At the same time, Balduin reached the last phase of his disease, and Raymond III was appointed as Regent instead of Guido.""

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The main difference is the correct name ""Balduin"" in the reference translation, which is missing in the machine translation.
- The term ""regendiks"" is correctly translated as ""Regent"" in the reference translation.

1. **Verb tense**: The reference translation uses ""held"" in the past tense, which is appropriate for a past event, while the machine translation uses ""held"" in the present tense. This suggests that the machine might be missing the context or might be using a generic translation for the verb.

2. **Article**: The reference translation has ""the"" before ""first television debate,"" which is necessary to specify a unique event, whereas the machine translation omits it. This could lead to a less clear understanding of the context.

3. **Preposition**: The reference translation uses ""of"" to indicate the relationship between the debate and the candidates, while the machine translation uses ""on."" Although both are commonly used, ""of"" is more precise in this context, as it implies the candidates are the focus of the debate.

4. **Word order**: The source text and both translations maintain a similar word order, but the machine translation has ""on the"" before ""six main presidential candidates,"" which is less natural in English. The reference translation follows a more standard English structure.

Step 1: Compare the structure and meaning of the phrases
- Source: ""Eetiliste dispositsioonide kujunemine on inimestel looduslik, kuigi vajab kasvatust ja kätkeb konventsiooni.""
- Machine translation: ""The development of ethical positions is natural for people, even though they need upbringing and are associated with the Convention.""
- Reference translation: ""The development of ethical dispositions is natural for people, even though it requires upbringing and entails convention.""

Step 2: Identify differences in translation
- ""Eetiliste dispositsioonide"" (ethical dispositions) vs ""ethical positions"" - The machine translation uses ""positions"" instead of ""dispositions,"" which might imply a slightly different focus on the nature of the ethical framework.
- ""kujunemine"" (development) is translated accurately.
- ""on inimestel looduslik"" (is natural for people) is the same in both translations.
- ""kuigi"" (even though) is translated correctly.
- ""vajab kasvatust"" (needs upbringing) is translated accurately.
- ""ja kätkeb konventsiooni"" (and is associated with the Convention) vs ""and entails convention"" - The machine translation uses ""is associated with"" while the reference translation uses ""entails,"" which might imply a slightly different nuance. ""Entails"" suggests a more direct connection or consequence, whereas ""is associated with"" is more general.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality
- The machine translation captures the main idea and structure of the source text, but there are slight differences in the choice of words (""positions"" instead of ""dispositions"" and ""is associated with"" instead of ""entails""). These differences might affect the precision and connotation of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is generally accurate but loses some nuance in the choice of words, particularly in the description of the relationship with the convention. The reference translation is more precise and conveys a slightly stronger connection between ethical development and convention. Overall, the machine translation is of good quality but could be improved with a more precise choice of terms.

Step 1: Compare the structure and meaning of the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Aga kõik niisugused edasised ja konkreetsemad määratlused ei jäta olemist enam puhtaks olemiseks, nagu ta alguses vahetult on.
Machine translation: However, not all such further and more specific definitions leave it out of existence any longer, as it is at the very beginning.

Step 2: Identify differences in word order and phrasing.
- In the source, ""nagu ta alguses vahetult on"" is translated as ""as it is at the very beginning"" in the machine translation. The phrase ""nagu ta alguses vahetult"" is a bit more idiomatic and implies that it is initially without exception, while the machine translation directly translates ""at the very beginning"" without capturing the nuance.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the differences on the meaning.
- The machine translation might lose some of the original emphasis on the idea that the exceptionlessness is a characteristic at the beginning, which could affect the overall clarity of the sentence.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: However, any such further and more specific definitions do not leave being any longer the pure being, as it is at the very beginning.

Step 5: Identify similarities and differences between the machine and reference translations.
- Both translations convey the idea that further definitions do not maintain the original purity, but the reference translation adds the concept of ""pure being"" which is not present in the machine translation.
- The reference translation also rephrases the source to say ""do not leave being"" instead of ""do not leave it out of existence,"" which gives a slightly different emphasis on the change.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the emphasis on the initial exceptionlessness and the addition of the concept ""pure being."" The reference translation captures a more nuanced and idiomatic expression of the source text, while the machine translation is a more direct but potentially less precise translation.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Laur Põder comes to Mumm 's bee farm and finds a common ground with Jaak.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""Mummi mesindustallu"" (Mumm's bee farm), while the machine translation says ""Beekeeping Talks of Mumm"", which is a different context.
- The source text has ""kes leiab peagi"" (who will soon find), while the machine translation omits the future tense and says ""who will soon find a common language"", which is a direct translation but loses the sense of future action.
- The source text has ""Jaaguga ühise keele"" (with Jaaguga a common language), while the machine translation has ""with Jaau"" without specifying the common language.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly translates ""Mummi mesindustallu"" as ""Mumm's bee farm"".
- The reference translation uses ""comes"" instead of ""saabub"", which is a more natural choice in English.
- The reference translation keeps the future tense ""will find"" and adds ""a common ground"" instead of ""a common language"", which is a more accurate expression for the context.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Allanile saabub külla kunagine pinginaaber Andrus.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The clan arrives in Andrus.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Allan is visited by Andrus, his former desk mate.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- In the source text, ""Allanile saabub külla"" refers to ""Allan is visited"" (with a genitive form indicating possession or origin).
- ""kunagine pinginaaber"" means ""former desk mate"" or ""old classmate.""
- ""Andrus"" is the name, which remains the same in both translations.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation omits the possessive form ""kunagine"" and the context of ""former desk mate,"" which is crucial for understanding the relationship between Allan and Andrus.
- Instead, it says ""The clan arrives in Andrus,"" which is a completely different interpretation.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the relationship and context. The reference translation accurately conveys that Andrus, Allan's former desk mate, is visiting Allan, while the machine translation incorrectly suggests a clan arriving at Andrus's location.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Hukkus 1 politseinik, veel 1 politseinik sai vigastada.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: 1 policeman was killed, another 1 police officers were injured.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: 1 policeman was killed, another police officer injured.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the source text
- The machine translation correctly translates ""hukkus"" as ""was killed"" and ""politisinik"" as ""policeman.""
- However, the machine translation adds the unnecessary word ""another"" before ""1 police officers"" and includes the word ""injured"" in a separate clause, which is not present in the source text.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation omits the word ""veel"" (still, or also) from the source, which might be important for conveying the additional information that another officer was also affected.
- The reference translation combines the information about the second officer being injured into a single clause, using ""another police officer injured"" instead of specifying the number.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it includes extra words and structure, which may lead to a less concise and accurate representation of the source text. The reference translation captures the essence of the source by combining the information about the two officers in a single clause.

1. **""See tsirkulaarsus"" vs. ""This circularity"":** The source text refers to ""tsirkulaarsus"" (circularity), which is translated as ""This circus"" in the machine translation. The machine translation incorrectly translates the concept, as it refers to a physical circus instead of the abstract concept.

2. **""teeb neid kehtetuks"" vs. ""does not invalidate them"":** The source text uses ""teeb neid kehtetuks"" (make them invalid), while the machine translation omits this part, resulting in ""does not invalidate them."" The reference translation includes this point, emphasizing that the circularity does not render the ideas invalid.

3. **""teeb need teooria osaks"" vs. ""but makes them part of the theory"":** Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning, but the structure is slightly different. The machine translation uses ""but makes them part of the theory,"" while the source text uses ""teeb need teooria osaks,"" which is a more direct translation.

4. **""mistõttu"" vs. ""which is why"":** The source text uses ""mistõttu"" (therefore), while the machine translation omits this conjunction. The reference translation includes ""which is why,"" providing a similar explanation for the need to test the ideas.

5. **""neid tuleb järele katsuda"" vs. ""they must be confronted"":** The source text says ""järele katsuda"" (to test), which is translated as ""confronted"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly uses ""tested,"" which aligns better with the context of evaluating ideas.

In summary, the machine translation has several differences from the reference translation, including incorrect interpretation of the source text's concept, omissions, and a less accurate translation of certain phrases. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuances of the original Estonian text.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: ""Ta peaks ilma mõtlemata naist päästma hüppama, iga mõte oleks olnud üleliigne.""
Machine translation: ""He should save a woman without thinking about it; every thought would have been superfluous.""

Step 2: Identify differences in sentence structure and word choice.
- The source text uses ""hüppama"" (jumping), while the machine translation uses ""without thinking about it"" which implies a more general action rather than a specific action of jumping.
- The source text has ""iga mõte"" (every thought), while the machine translation has ""every thought"" without specifying ""every"".

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: ""He should jump in to save the woman without thinking ; every thought would have been superfluous.""

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The reference translation adds ""jump in"" to clearly indicate the action of saving the woman, which is missing in the machine translation.
- The reference translation maintains the structure ""without thinking"" but adds a comma for better clarity, which the machine translation does not have.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specifying the action of ""jumping"" to save the woman and the punctuation for clarity. The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately, emphasizing the urgency and the superfluousness of thoughts in the rescue situation.

|Machine translation: Mr Kuslap is telling me that Johdoni has a black past and that it should be made a piece of paper.|
|Reference translation: Kristjan tells Kuslap that Johannes has a dark past and that it should be written about in the newspaper.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject and verb**: The source uses ""Kristjan räägib"" (Kristjan tells), while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Mr Kuslap is telling me"". The reference translation correctly keeps the subject as ""Kristjan"" and uses ""tells"".
2. **Indirect speech**: The source uses ""Kuslapile"" (to Kuslap), which is an indirect form of address. The machine translation omits this, making it sound like Mr Kuslap is addressing an unknown listener. The reference translation includes ""Kuslap"" as the recipient of the information.
3. **Proper noun**: ""Johannesel"" in the source is a genitive form of ""Johannes"" (Johannes's), indicating possession. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Johdoni"", which is not a proper noun and does not convey the possessive relationship. The reference translation correctly uses ""Johannes"".
4. **Description of the past**: ""must minevik"" (dark past) is translated accurately in both the machine and reference translations.
5. **Action suggestion**: ""sellest tuleks teha ajalehte üks kirjatükk"" (it should be made a piece of paper) is translated as ""that it should be made a piece of paper"" in the machine translation, which is a literal but less idiomatic translation. The reference translation rephrases it as ""that it should be written about in the newspaper"", which is more natural and conveys the intended meaning.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in subject-verb agreement, indirect speech, and the context of the address. It also loses some nuance in the suggestion of writing about the past in a newspaper. The reference translation is a more accurate and natural adaptation of the source text.

The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly consistent, with only a slight difference in punctuation. The source text has a period after the date, while the machine and reference translations have a comma. The meaning is the same in all three versions, but the reference translation adheres more closely to the typical English style of separating the date from the rest of the sentence with a comma.

Here's a breakdown of the differences:

1. **Source:** 23. veebruar 2013 Itaalia president Giorgio Napolitano.
   - **Machine Translation:** of 23 February 2013, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano.
   - **Reference Translation:** 23 February 2013 , Italian President Giorgio Napolitano.

The machine translation adds ""of"" which is unnecessary and changes the period to a comma, while the reference translation keeps the date format as ""23 February 2013"" and adds a comma for clarity in English.

Overall, the machine translation is not entirely accurate in terms of punctuation, but the content is the same. The quality could be improved by ensuring adherence to standard English punctuation rules.

Source: Mehed on tihti ka palgatööl kalurite ja ehitajatena või kontoritööl linnas.
Machine translation: Men are also often employed as fishermen and builders or as office work in the city.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- The machine translation uses ""as office work"" while the source text uses ""kontoritööl"" (which is the Estonian word for ""office work"" or ""office jobs"").
- The source text includes ""linnas"" (city) at the end, which is not present in the machine translation.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Men are also often employed as fishermen and builders or in office work in the city.

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The machine translation correctly translates ""kalurite ja ehitajatena"" (fishermen and builders) but omits the preposition ""ja"" (and) before ""kontoritööl"" in the second part of the sentence, which should be ""or"" in English.
- The reference translation includes the preposition ""in"" before ""office work"" to indicate the location, which is consistent with the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the use of the conjunction ""or"" and the inclusion of the preposition ""in"" to clarify the location of the office work. The source text uses ""kontoritööl linnas"" while the machine translation omits the preposition and the reference translation includes it. The overall meaning is preserved, but the structure and precision of the reference translation are closer to the original Estonian text.

1. **""Eetilise väärtuse"" vs. ""an ethical value"":** The source text uses the definite form ""eetilise väärtuse"" (ethical value), while the machine translation translates it as ""an ethical value."" The definite form in Estonian implies a specific or known value, whereas ""an"" in English is more general and could refer to any ethical value. The reference translation captures this specificity.

2. **""dispositsioonide"" vs. ""positions"":** The source text uses ""dispositsioonide"" (dispositions), which refers to the inclinations, attitudes, or habits that shape one's ethical behavior. The machine translation translates this as ""positions,"" which could be interpreted more broadly as formal stances or viewpoints rather than the nuanced context of dispositions. The reference translation correctly uses ""dispositions"" to convey the intended meaning.

In summary, the machine translation loses some nuance and accuracy in capturing the essence of the source text, particularly in the choice of words that convey the specific nature of ethical dispositions.

|Analysis|
1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same essential information: a gas explosion occurred at a coal mine in Yujialing, which is located in the Chinese province of Shanxi.
2. The main difference lies in the preposition used to connect ""Yujialing"" and ""Shanxi."" The machine translation uses ""the Chinese province of Shanx,"" while the reference translation uses ""in the Chinese province of Shanx."" The latter is more common and grammatically correct, as it specifies the location within the province without repeating ""province.""
3. The source text includes the word ""provintsis,"" which is a less common way to refer to a province in Estonian. Both translations adapt it to ""province"" in English, but the reference translation is more consistent with the standard English expression.

Overall, the machine translation is accurate but slightly less idiomatic than the reference translation. The main difference is in the choice of preposition, which does not significantly affect the meaning but could be improved for better clarity and fluency.|

1. **""heitis vastavalt erakonna aukohtu ettepanekule""** (the management board reacted according to the party's proposal) vs. **""as proposed by the party's court""** (translated as ""as proposed by the party's court""). The source text refers to a specific proposal made by the party's court, while the machine translation generalizes it as a proposal without specifying the nature of the court.

2. **""erakonnast välja""** (from the party) vs. **""from the party""**. Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation adds ""the Party"" for clarity.

3. **""XII Riigikogu liikme""** (member of the XII Riigikogu) vs. **""People's Assembly of XII""**. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Riigikogu"" as ""People's Assembly,"" which is not accurate. The correct term for the Estonian parliament is ""Riigikogu.""

4. **""Party's court of honour""** (translated in the reference) is a more precise term than ""party's court"" in the machine translation, as it specifies the type of court (honour) that made the proposal.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in the specificity of the court, the incorrect translation of ""Riigikogu,"" and the lack of the term ""court of honour."" The reference translation provides a more accurate and nuanced translation.|

|Analysis:|
1. The source text refers to ""muistse vabadusvõitluse"" which translates to ""memorial freedom struggle"" or ""ancient freedom fight"" in the context of Estonian history.

|Analysis:|

1. **Sentence structure**: Both the machine translation and the reference translation maintain the same sentence structure, with the subject ""He"" followed by the action ""contested the granting of a patent"" and then the claim about the invention.

2. **Time expression**: The phrase ""Nüüd"" (now) is correctly translated to ""He now"" in both translations, indicating the same point in time.

3. **Claim**: The phrase ""väites, et tema oli sama meetodi juba varem leiutanud"" is translated to ""claiming that he had already invented the same method before"" in both. The meaning is preserved, but the word order is slightly different. In the machine translation, ""claiming"" is a separate clause, while in the reference, it's part of the main clause.

4. **Verb tense**: The past tense ""oli"" (was) is not directly translated in the machine translation, but the meaning is still conveyed through the phrase ""had already invented.""

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate, with only a minor difference in the structure of the claim.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Phyllis ajanud Aristotelesel pea nii segi, et see lubanud tal enda seljas isegi ratsutada.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: In Phyllis, Aristotle head so that it even allowed him to sound on his back.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Phyllis had Aristotle so confused that he even allowed him to ride on his back.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation starts with ""In Phyllis,"" which is not present in the source text. The source text does not specify a context for the confusion, so it's better to keep it as ""Phyllis ajanud Aristotelesel pea.""
- ""ajanud"" (confused) is translated as ""head"" in the machine translation, which is a literal translation but does not convey the intended meaning of confusion. The reference translation uses ""had Aristotle so confused.""
- ""lubanud tal"" (allowed him) is translated as ""allowed him to sound"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect. The correct meaning is ""allowed him to ride.""
- ""enda seljas ratsutada"" (to ride on his back) is translated as ""sound on his back"" in the machine translation, which is a poor fit for the context. The reference translation correctly uses ""ride on his back.""

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several aspects, including the context, the verb to express confusion, and the action of riding on someone's back. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuance of the original Estonian text.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Abel müüs oma patendi Suurbritannia riigile, keda ei saanud kohtusse kaevata.
Machine translation: It sold its patent to the British state, which could not be taken to court.

Step 2: Identify differences in sentence structure and word choice.
- In the source text, ""müüs"" (sold) is in the past tense, while in the machine translation, it's implied as ""sold"" (past tense) but not explicitly stated.
- The source text uses ""keda"" (which) to refer to ""Suurbritannia riigile"" (British state), while the machine translation uses ""which"" to introduce the clause about not being able to be taken to court.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences.
- The main difference is the lack of explicit past tense in the machine translation, which might slightly affect the clarity of the action.
- The placement of ""which could not be taken to court"" in the machine translation is correct but not directly aligned with the source text, where it follows the subject ""Suurbritannia riigile.""

Step 4: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Abel sold its patent to the British state, which could not be taken to court.

Step 5: Conclusion.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, capturing the essence of the source text. However, it could be improved by explicitly stating the past tense (""sold"") and maintaining a closer alignment with the source text's structure, like placing the clause about not being able to be taken to court after ""British state."" The overall meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is clearer and more faithful to the original.

Machine translation: ""The President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, signed amendments to the Constitution which removed the restriction of the two terms of office that had been in force so far for the President of Kazakhstan.""

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The source text specifies ""presidendile"" (to the president), while the machine translation omits it, referring to ""the President"" without specifying to whom the restriction applied.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: ""The President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, signed amendments to the Constitution which removed the restriction of the two terms of office that had been in force so far for the President.""

Step 4: Analyze the difference.
- The reference translation is similar to the machine translation but omits ""presidendile"" as well, which might be an assumption that the reader understands the context. However, it's not entirely clear from the source text if the restriction applied to the president in general or specifically to the current president.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it omits the word ""presidendile,"" which could potentially lead to confusion about whether the restriction applied to the president in general or only to the current president. The reference translation assumes the reader understands the context, but the source text could benefit from a more explicit reference to the president in question.

|Source:| Sedasi sai Mihhail Botvinnikust 1948. aastal Nõukogude Liidu esimene male maailmameister.|
|Machine translation:| This is what Mikhail Botvinners became in 1948 the first most important world champion of the Soviet Union.|
|Reference translation:| This is how Mikhail Botvinnik became in 1948 the first chess world champion of the Soviet Union.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Omission of ""male""**: The machine translation omits the word ""male"" from the source, which is crucial to convey the gender of the person being referred to, as it specifies that Botvinnik was the first male world champion.

2. **Change in meaning**: The phrase ""esimene male maailmameister"" in the source means ""the first male world champion"" in Estonian. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the first most important world champion,"" which changes the emphasis and meaning, as it implies a ranking of importance rather than gender.

3. **Word order and structure**: The reference translation maintains a more natural and direct word order, translating ""Sedasi sai"" as ""This is how"" and keeping ""Mihhail Botvinnikust"" as ""Mikhail Botvinnik became."" The machine translation rearranges the phrases, which can lead to a less clear and natural reading.

4. **Specificity of ""chess""**: The reference translation includes the word ""chess"" to clarify the context of the world championship, which is important for understanding the subject matter. The machine translation does not include this detail.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, specificity, and naturalness, particularly in the handling of gender, context, and word order. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the original Estonian text.

Step 1: Identify the main subject and verb
Source: Ameerika Ühendriikides valiti (In the United States, was elected)
Machine translation: Ray Nagin, the city of New Orthodox, was re-elected
Reference translation: Ray Nagin was re-elected mayor

Step 2: Compare the subject

Step 3: Compare the verb phrase
Source: tagasi (back, re-elected)

Step 4: Compare the additional information about the election
Source: poolt andis hääle 52,4% valimas käinud kodanikest (by the vote of 52.4% of the citizens who went to vote)
Machine translation: voted for by 52.4% of the citizens who went to vote
Reference translation: for whom 52.4% of the citizens who went to vote voted

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""New Orleansi linnapeaks"" as ""the city of New Orthodox,"" which is not a correct term. It should be ""mayor of New Orleans.""
- The reference translation correctly includes the phrase ""for whom"" to indicate the relationship between the citizens and their vote, which is missing in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences in terms of the correct city name and the structure of the sentence, which affects the clarity of the information. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

|Machine translation: Mathematics have also developed tools for hydrodynamics and theory for language learning, for example.|
|Reference translation: Mathematicians have also developed tools , for instance , for the theories of hydrodynamics and language vibration.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject**: In the source, the subject is ""Matemaatikud"" (Mathematicians), but the machine translation incorrectly uses ""Mathematics"" as the subject, which is a collective noun and does not convey the individual experts.
2. **Verb**: The verb ""töötasid välja"" (developed) is translated to ""have also developed"" in the machine translation, which is a correct past tense form but loses the aspect of the original verb, which implies a completed action.
3. **""ka vahendid""**: The phrase ""ka vahendid"" (also tools) is translated as ""for"" in the machine translation, which is not a direct equivalent. ""Ka"" means ""also"" and ""vahendid"" means ""tools"", so the reference translation uses ""for instance"" to convey a similar meaning.
4. **""näiteks""**: This adverb is translated as ""for example"" in the machine translation, which is a correct equivalent but placed differently in the sentence structure.
5. **""hüdrodünaamika""**: The term remains the same in both translations, but the machine translation omits the article ""ja"" (and) before it, which is necessary to connect it with ""keele võnkumise teooria"" (language vibration theory).
6. **""keele võnkumise teooria""**: The machine translation translates this as ""language learning theory"", while the reference translation uses ""language vibration theory"", which is a more specific term that better fits the context.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in subject, verb aspect, and the specific term for language theory, which affect the overall meaning and quality of the translation. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the nuances of the original text.

|Reference translation: The situation was also difficult for the Danes, who also lost most of their holdings in Estonia.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""taanlastele"" which refers to ""Danes"" in Estonian. The machine translation correctly identifies this as ""the Danes"".
2. The source text mentions ""suurema osa oma Eestimaa valdustest"" which means ""most of their holdings in Estonia"". The machine translation captures this as ""most of the holdings in Estonia"", but omits the possessive pronoun ""their"" before ""holdings"".
3. The reference translation includes the possessive pronoun ""their"" before ""holdings"", which is not present in the machine translation.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the possessive pronoun ""their"" in the phrase ""most of the holdings in Estonia"", which is present in the reference translation. This makes the reference translation slightly more precise and natural in English. The core meaning is preserved, but the inclusion of ""their"" adds a nuance that the machine translation might have missed.

|Reference translation: A life annuity contract creates a continual debt relationship between the parties, but the object of the contract does not always have to be a tangible thing.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Elurendiselepinguga""** (Machine: ""The Elurenting Agreement"") - The machine translation uses a proper noun, ""The Elurenting Agreement,"" which might be a specific term or organization name. The reference translation uses a more general term, ""life annuity contract,"" which could apply to various types of agreements. This might be a difference in context or specificity.
2. **""poolte vahel kestvusvõlasuhe""** (Machine: ""between the parties"") - The translation is accurate, but the word order is slightly different in the machine translation.
3. **""kuid alati ei pea lepingu esemeks olema""** (Machine: ""but does not always have to be the subject of the contract"") - The meaning is preserved, but the structure is slightly different. ""Esemeks"" in the source text is translated as ""the subject of"" in the machine translation.
4. **""materiaalne asi""** (Machine: ""the material matter"") - The machine translation uses a direct translation, but the reference translation uses ""a tangible thing,"" which might be a more natural way to express the idea in English.

Overall, the machine translation captures the essence of the source text but loses some nuance and context by using a specific term and slightly altering the structure. The reference translation provides a more general and natural-sounding translation that could apply to various types of contracts, not just Elurenting Agreements.

The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly consistent, with only a slight difference in phrasing. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. Both translations convey the same information: ""Luksemburgis"" (in Luxembourg), ""Euroopa Liidu välisministrite kahepäevane kohtumine"" (a two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers), and ""Eesti välisminister Marina Kaljurand"" (Estonian Foreign Minister Marina Kaljurand).

2. The machine translation uses ""including the Estonian Foreign Minister Marina Kaljurand,"" while the reference translation uses ""which was also attended by Estonian Foreign Minister Marina Kaljurand."" The meaning is the same, but the reference translation adds the word ""also"" to emphasize that Marina Kaljurand's presence is in addition to the general meeting.

3. The machine translation omits the word ""which"" that is present in the reference translation, but this does not significantly alter the meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is accurate, but the reference translation provides a slightly more nuanced and natural-sounding sentence by including ""also."" The difference is minor and does not affect the core meaning.

1. **Time expression**: The source text uses ""Samal ajal"" (at the same time), which is correctly translated as ""At the same time"" in both the reference and machine translation.
2. **Subject and verb**: The subject ""ta"" (he) and the verb ""võib"" (can) are preserved in both translations, but the verb phrase ""teda kui"" (him as) is slightly different.
3. **Moral cause**: In the source, ""moraalse ürituse vastast"" (as a moral cause's opponent) is translated as ""as a moral cause"" in the machine translation. The reference translation adds ""an opponent to"" for clarity, which is a possible improvement but not necessarily incorrect.

**Analysis**: The main difference lies in the interpretation of ""moraalse ürituse vastast"" as ""a moral cause"" or ""an opponent to the moral cause."" The machine translation omits the ""an opponent to"" part, which might lead to a slightly different meaning, suggesting that the person respects the moral cause itself rather than someone opposing it.

Step 1: Identify key terms and phrases
- Source: Vasa konstruktsiooni, kiilu maha panekut
- Machine translation: the construction of the left, roof had been put down
- Reference translation: Vasa 's construction, keel had been laid

Step 2: Compare the source and machine translation
- The source mentions ""Vasa konstruktsiooni"" (Vasa's construction), while the machine translation refers to ""the construction of the left,"" which is not a direct match. The context suggests that ""Vasa"" is a specific ship, so it should be kept intact in the translation.
- The source uses ""kiilu maha panekut"" (putting the roof down), while the machine translation uses ""roof had been put down."" The meaning is similar, but the source uses a more specific term for the shipbuilding context, which is ""keel"" (keel-laying) in the reference translation.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation and reference translation
- The reference translation correctly translates ""Vasa 's construction"" and uses the term ""keel had been laid"" which is more appropriate in the context of shipbuilding.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in two main aspects:
1. It translates ""Vasa konstruktsiooni"" as ""the construction of the left"" instead of ""Vasa 's construction.""
2. It uses ""roof had been put down"" when the source refers to ""kiilu maha panekut,"" which should be translated as ""keel had been laid"" in the context of shipbuilding.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should be revised to: ""There is little evidence to suggest that Vasa's construction would have been substantially altered after the keel had been laid.""

**Analysis:**

1. **Location**: The source mentions ""Ilovaiskis"" (referring to a place), but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""Ilovak,"" which is likely a typo or a misunderstanding of the location. The reference translation is correct.

2. **Fighting types**: The source uses ""lahingud"" (battles), ""tänavalahingud"" (street battles), and ""käsitsivõitlus"" (hand-to-hand combat) to describe the conflict. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""käsitsivõitlus"" as ""the fight between government forces and the documents,"" which is unrelated to the context.

3. **Entities**: The source refers to ""valitsusvägede"" (government forces) and ""okupantide"" (occupants). The machine translation incorrectly translates ""okupantide"" as ""documents,"" which is a significant error. The reference translation correctly uses ""occupants.""

In summary, the machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in terms of location, the type of fighting, and the entities involved.

1. **Subject**: In the source text, the subject is ""vihkaja"" (hater), but the machine translation incorrectly identifies it as ""virus"". This is a significant difference, as it changes the meaning of the sentence.

2. **Comparison**: The source text compares the hater's desire for beauty to ""teistest ilusatest"" (other beauties), while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""other pieces of beauty"". The reference translation correctly uses ""other beauties"" to convey the intended comparison.

3. **Superlative**: The source text uses ""kõrgem"" (higher) to express a sense of superiority, but the machine translation omits the superlative form, making it less clear. The reference translation includes ""higher than all"" to emphasize the superiority.

4. **Scope**: The source text implies that the hater wants to be superior to all living and healthy things, while the machine translation does not clearly convey this. The reference translation clarifies this by including ""than all"".

5. **Word choice**: The reference translation uses ""all"" to encompass both living and healthy things, which is a more natural and precise choice than the machine translation's ""living and healthy.""

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of subject, comparison, and clarity of the superlative. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuances of the original Estonian text.

Analysis:
1. The source text uses ""lisaks"" which means ""in addition"" in Estonian. The machine translation accurately captures this meaning as ""In addition"".
2. The source mentions ""hukkusid rünnakus"" which means ""were killed in the attack"". The machine translation also translates this phrase correctly as ""were killed in the attack"".
3. The source includes ""iraaklasest tõlk"" which means ""an Iraqi interpreter"". The machine translation translates this as ""an Iraqi interpreter"", which is accurate.
4. The issue lies in the use of the word ""still"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the source text. The source does not provide any information about the timing of the event, so the addition of ""still"" implies a continuation or persistence that is not clear from the original sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the inclusion of ""still"" without context slightly alters the meaning, making it potentially misleading.

3. The reference translation adds the word ""after"" to emphasize that the obligation to maintain secrecy continues after the contract has ended, which is a crucial point not explicitly mentioned in the source text but implied.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate but could be improved by specifying ""after its expiry"" instead of ""at the end of it"" to clearly convey that the obligation continues beyond the contract's termination, as in the reference translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Eelmine lumesadu (previous snowfall) Nepali pealinnas (in Nepal's capital city) leidis aset (was found) 63 aastat varem (63 years earlier).

Machine translation: The previous snow (lumesadu) in Nepal's capital city (Nepali pealinnas) was 63 years earlier (63 aastat varem).

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The machine translation omits the word ""fall"" (lumesadu), which is crucial for conveying the meaning of a snow event.
- The machine translation uses ""The previous snow"" instead of ""previous snowfall,"" which is a more accurate and idiomatic way to express the event.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: The previous snowfall (lumesadu) in Nepal 's capital city (Nepali pealinnas) was 63 years earlier (63 aastat varem).

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation includes the word ""fall"" (lumesadu), which is essential for the context.
- The reference translation uses the possessive form ""Nepal 's"" (Nepali) to indicate the capital city, which is more precise than the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the word ""snowfall"" and the possessive form for ""Nepal's capital city."" The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic, capturing the intended meaning of the source text.

1. **Translation of key terms**: In the source text, ""falsifitseeritav"" is the key term that needs to be translated accurately. The machine translation uses ""punishable,"" which is not the correct term for this context. The reference translation uses ""falsifiable,"" which is the correct term to convey the idea that a scientific theory can be tested and potentially disproven.

2. **Structure and meaning**: The machine translation changes the structure of the sentence, making it sound like a scientific law or theory is punished for making a claim, which is not the case. The reference translation maintains the original meaning, stating that a theory is falsifiable because of its claim.

3. **Precision**: The reference translation is more precise, using ""states"" instead of ""claims,"" which implies a more objective and fact-based statement, in line with the scientific context.

4. **Omission and addition**: The machine translation omits the word ""midagi määratletud"" (something defined) from the source, which is crucial for understanding the concept of falsifiability. The reference translation includes this part, making the translation more faithful to the original.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the choice of words, structure, and precision.

|Reference translation: After lengthy negotiations in which both acted diplomatically but without changing their positions, Kaloyan was crowned king at the end of 1204.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""krooniti"" (was crowned), which is a verb in the passive voice. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""was crowned with kings,"" which implies multiple crowns, while the reference translation correctly uses ""was crowned"" (singular).
2. The source text specifies ""Kalojan"" as the subject, and the reference translation correctly uses ""Kaloyan"" (a proper noun, likely a variant of the name). The machine translation omits the name, making it unclear who was crowned.
3. The machine translation adds ""kings"" after ""crowned,"" which is unnecessary and incorrect, as the reference translation clearly states that Kaloyan was crowned as a king, not with multiple kings.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its handling of the passive verb ""krooniti,"" the proper noun ""Kalojan,"" and the unnecessary addition of ""kings."" The correct translation should be: ""After lengthy negotiations in which both acted diplomatically but without changing their positions, Kaloyan was crowned king at the end of 1204.""

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Doubts are also disciplined in the moral meaning of what has been done.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Regret is also disciplined remembering of the moral significance of what has been done.

Step 4: Compare the key phrases and words
- Machine translation: ""Doubts are also disciplined"" vs ""Regret is also disciplined""
- Reference translation: ""remembering of the moral significance"" vs ""the moral meaning""

Step 5: Analyze differences
- The machine translation uses ""doubts"" while the reference translation uses ""regret."" This is a significant difference, as ""doubts"" and ""regret"" convey different emotions and mental states.
- The machine translation has ""in the moral meaning of what has been done,"" while the reference has ""the moral significance of what has been done."" The difference is subtle but important, as ""meaning"" can be broader, while ""significance"" specifically refers to the importance or relevance.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the emotional aspect (doubts vs regret) and the specific phrasing related to the moral aspect (meaning vs significance). The reference translation captures the nuance of acknowledging the moral impact of an action, while the machine translation does not quite convey the same depth.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Kaks sõdurit sai vigastada ja toimetati ravile Tshinvali haiglasse.
Machine translation: Two soldiers were injured and brought to Tskinvali's hospital for treatment.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- The machine translation adds the possessive 's' after ""Tskinvali,"" which is not present in the source text. In Estonian, ""Tshinvali haiglasse"" is already understood to refer to the Tskhinvali hospital without the possessive.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: Two soldiers were injured and brought to Tskinvali's hospital for treatment.
Reference translation: Two soldiers were injured and brought to Tskhinvali hospital for treatment.

Step 4: Analyze the impact of the difference.
The difference is minor and does not change the meaning significantly. The possessive 's' is often added in English to indicate ownership, but in this context, it is implied that the hospital belongs to Tskhinvali. The reference translation is more concise and faithful to the original Estonian.

Conclusion: The machine translation is slightly different from the reference translation due to the addition of the possessive 's,' but the overall meaning remains the same. The quality of the translation is good, with the main issue being a minor stylistic choice.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: There were smoking ruins opposite to the St. Catherine church and collapses prevented continuation of the drive.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""Katariina kiriku"" (St. Catherine's church), while the machine translation refers to ""The Church of Qatar.""
- The source text uses ""ahervaremed ja varingud"" (ruins and collapses), which are translated to ""smoking harbours and theft"" in the machine translation. This is a significant difference, as ""ahervaremed"" does not mean ""smoking harbours"" and ""varingud"" does not mean ""theft.""
- The source text talks about ""tõkestasid edasisõidu"" (prevented further journeys), which is translated to ""prevented further journeys"" in the machine translation, but the structure is slightly different.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Kuningas oli saanud teada, mis juhtuma hakkab, ja põgenes läbi palee akna, kus ta elas, ja ratsutas pooleldi riietatult linnast välja.""
- Machine translation: ""The Kingdom had learned what would happen and escaped through the Palace Shop Screen and half-ripped out of the city.""

Difference: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""palee akna"" (palace window) as ""Palace Shop Screen,"" which is a literal translation that does not convey the intended meaning. Additionally, ""ratsutas"" (rode out) is not present in the machine translation, and ""pooleldi riietatult"" (half-clothed) is translated as ""half-ripped out,"" which is a poor approximation of the original phrase.

Step 2: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
- Source: ""Kuningas oli saanud teada, mis juhtuma hakkab, ja põgenes läbi palee akna, kus ta elas, ja ratsutas pooleldi riietatult linnast välja.""
- Reference translation: ""The king had learned what would happen and escaped through the palace window and rode out of the city, half-clothed.""

Difference: The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text by translating ""palee akna"" as ""palace window"" and including ""ratsutas"" (rode out) with the correct verb ""rode."" It also maintains the phrase ""pooleldi riietatult"" (half-clothed) as ""half-clothed.""

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy and context. The machine translation mistranslates ""palee akna"" and omits important details like ""ratsutas"" and the description of the king's attire. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more faithful and natural translation of the source text.

|Machine translation: In such a demographic unsustainable situation, migration has been the only source of population growth.|
|Reference translation: In such a demographically unsustainable situation, migration has been the only source of population growth.|

|Analysis:|
1. The source text starts with ""Taolises demograafiliselt"" which means ""demographically speaking"" or ""in a demographic context."" The machine translation captures this as ""In such a demographic unsustainable situation,"" which is accurate.
2. The source text mentions ""jätkusuutmatus olukorras"" which refers to an ""unsustainable situation"" or ""circumstance."" The machine translation correctly translates this as ""unsustainable situation.""
3. The main point is that ""ränne"" (migration) is the ""ainaks elanikkonna kasvu allikaks"" or ""only source of population growth."" The machine translation conveys this as ""migration has been the only source of population growth,"" which is a faithful translation.

|Conclusion:|
The machine translation is quite accurate, with only minor differences in punctuation (the machine translation omits the comma after ""situation"" which is not essential in English).

Machine translation: However, it is not necessary, as Kant thinks, to abandon all interests in order to exclude fish.

Step 2: Identify key phrases and differences.
- ""kõrvalejätmiseks"" (for the sake of excluding) in the source is translated as ""to exclude fish"" in the machine translation. This might be a literal translation that doesn't fully capture the intended meaning of ""excluding oneself"" or ""putting aside"" for the sake of a higher purpose.
- ""kõigist huvidest"" (all interests) is translated as ""all interests"" in both, but the context suggests a more personal or self-related interest, which might be lost in the machine translation.
- ""nagu Kant arvab"" (as Kant thinks) is the same in both, but the nuance of Kant's perspective might be slightly different in the reference translation.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: However , it is not necessary , as Kant thinks , to abandon all interests in order to put the precious self aside .

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation uses ""put the precious self aside"" which conveys a sense of prioritizing one's own well-being or integrity, while the machine translation uses ""exclude fish,"" which is a more literal and less contextually appropriate translation.
- The reference translation also adds the phrase ""precious self,"" which is not present in the machine translation but adds a layer of emotional or personal significance to the idea.

2. The machine translation omits the word ""käsitas"" (considered) from the source, which is crucial for understanding the perspective of Heraclitus. This affects the overall meaning and the attribution of the idea to Heraclitus.
3. The machine translation uses ""hukkuvana"" (dying), while the reference translation uses ""as perishing,"" which is a more accurate representation of the original Estonian ""hukkuvana"" in this context, as it implies the ongoing nature of the destruction in chaos and war.

Overall, the machine translation captures the general idea but loses some nuances and accuracy in terms of verb choice and the specific interpretation of Heraclitus' perspective. The reference translation better aligns with the original Estonian text.

The source specifies ""millel osalesid Eesti valitsuse liikmetest"" (where members of the Estonian government participated), which is translated as ""attended by Commission Chairman Jüri Pihl, Andrus Ansip and Jaak Aaviker of the Estonian Government"" in the machine translation. The reference translation omits ""Commission Chairman"" and instead uses ""Chairman of the Committee,"" which is a more accurate and concise way to refer to the position in this context.
3. The source includes ""komisjoni esimees"" (commission head), which is translated as ""Commission Chairman"" in the machine translation. The reference translation uses ""Chairman of the Committee,"" which is more specific to the context of the meeting.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the way it refers to the position of Jüri Pihl, using ""Commission Chairman"" instead of ""Chairman of the Committee."" The reference translation is more precise and contextually appropriate. Other aspects of the translation are accurate, but the slight difference in the position title affects the overall quality.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Donetski linnas võeti üle telekommunikatsioonifirma Ukrtelekom ruumid ja seadmed""
- Machine translation: ""In Donetski's city, the telecoms company took over its premises and equipment""

The machine translation omits the word ""ruumid"" (premises) and ""seadmed"" (equipment) from the source, which are crucial for conveying the full meaning.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""resulting in the handing over of a fifth of the town's inhabitants""
- Reference translation: ""resulting in the disruption of telephone communications for one fifth of the city""

The machine translation uses ""handing over of a fifth of the town's inhabitants"" instead of ""disruption of telephone communications."" This is a significant difference, as the former implies a physical transfer of people, while the latter refers to the interruption of a service.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several aspects:
1. It omits the words ""ruumid"" and ""seadmed,"" which are important for accurately describing the situation.
2. It incorrectly translates the impact on the town's residents as ""handing over of a fifth"" instead of ""disruption of telephone communications.""

To improve the quality of the translation, the machine should include the missing words and accurately convey the disruption of services, not a physical transfer of people.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start| Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Kui moraal ei ole Looja antud, kust see siis on tulnud?

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: If the animal has not been given a moral, where has that come from?

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: If morality is not given by the Creator, where has it come from?

Step 4: Compare the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation
- In the machine translation, ""Looja"" is translated as ""the animal,"" which is incorrect. The correct translation should be ""the Creator.""
- The phrase ""moral"" is translated as ""moral"" in both, but the context suggests it should be translated as ""morality"" for a more accurate meaning.
- The structure of the sentence is slightly altered, with the reference translation placing ""Creator"" before ""has not been given"" for better clarity.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the incorrect translation of ""Looja"" as ""the animal"" and the lack of the word ""morality"" in its full context. The structure of the sentence is also adjusted in the reference translation to emphasize the source of morality. The correct evaluation would be that the machine translation is of lower quality due to these inaccuracies.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Nowadays, driving is only part of the tasks of ambulances.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Nowadays, driving the vehicle is only part of the tasks of an emergency medical technician.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""autojuhtimine"" (driving), which is translated as ""driving"" in the machine translation.
- The source text refers to ""kiirabitehniku ülesannet"" (tasks of an ambulance technician), which is translated as ""tasks of ambulances"" in the machine translation. However, ""ambulances"" is a general term for emergency vehicles, while the source specifies ""kiirabitehniku"" (emergency medical technician).

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly translates ""autojuhtimine"" as ""driving the vehicle"" to maintain the context of the source.
- It specifies ""an emergency medical technician"" instead of just ""ambulances,"" which is a more accurate translation of ""kiirabitehniku.""

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in that it does not specify ""emergency medical technician"" and instead uses a more general term ""ambulances."" The reference translation is more precise and faithful to the source text.

Reference translation: Murdoch proposes to add an idea of observation, examination.

|im_sep| Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""an examination"" after ""observation,"" while the reference translation omits the article ""an"" before ""examination.""
- The source text in Estonian uses ""vaatamise idee"" (idea of observation), which is translated as ""an idea of observation"" in both the machine and reference translations, but the article is different.

- The main difference is the use of the definite article ""an"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference translation. In Estonian, the concept of ""examination"" is often understood without the need for an article, especially when it's part of a broader idea.

|im_end|>
Conclusion: The machine translation is slightly different from the reference translation due to the inclusion of the article ""an"" before ""examination."" The core meaning, ""Murdoch proposes to add an idea of observation and examination,"" is preserved, but the reference translation is more concise and adheres more closely to the original Estonian structure.

Step 1: Identify key phrases and words in the source text
- Üksus (unit)
- hävitas (destroyed)
- tankirusikatega (with anti-tank weapons)
- ühe ""Nõukogude Eesti eest"" (one ""Soviet Estonia"")
- tanki (tank)
- teise järel (after another)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""The spectacle destroyed one 'Soviet Estonia' after tank with tank cards.""
- Reference translation: ""With anti-tank weapons, the unit destroyed one ""For Soviet Estonia"" tank after another.""

Step 3: Analyze differences
- ""The spectacle"" in the machine translation is not present in the source text. It seems to be a misinterpretation or a non-essential addition.
- ""tank with tank cards"" in the machine translation is not found in either the source or the reference. It likely refers to the anti-tank weapons, which are more accurately translated as ""tankirusikatega"" in the source.
- ""For Soviet Estonia"" in the reference translation is a more accurate and idiomatic way to express the meaning of ""Nõukogude Eesti eest"" than the literal translation.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:
1. It introduces a non-essential element (""The spectacle"").
2. It incorrectly translates ""tankirusikatega"" as ""tank with tank cards.""
3. It uses a more literal and less idiomatic translation for ""Nõukogude Eesti eest"" in the context of ""For Soviet Estonia.""

To improve the quality of the translation, the machine translation should be revised to: ""With anti-tank weapons, the unit destroyed one 'Nõukogude Eesti eest' tank after another.""

The machine translation and the reference translation differ in several aspects:

1. **Source term translation**: The source text mentions ""Piiramise kuuendal päeval"" which refers to ""the sixth day of the siege"" in the context. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""On the sixth day of the restriction in urban areas,"" which is not an accurate representation of the original event.

2. **Action description**: The source text describes the events that occurred during the sixth day as ""linnus vallutati"" (the city was conquered), ""eesolnud inimesed tapeti"" (people inside were killed), "" võeti vangi"" (were taken captive), and ""nende vara rööviti"" (their possessions were stolen). The machine translation combines these actions into a single sentence, stating ""the people who were conquered, killed, imprisoned and kidnapped,"" which loses the sequential and specific nature of the events.

3. **Sentence structure**: The reference translation maintains a more coherent structure, with each event described in a separate clause, while the machine translation combines them into a single sentence, making it less clear and harder to follow.

4. **Omission of context**: The reference translation includes the term ""stronghold"" (which is implied by ""Piiramise kuuendal"" in the source), which is not present in the machine translation, making it less precise.

In summary, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of event description, sentence structure, and context, resulting in a less accurate and clear rendition of the source text.

Source: Allan saab kokku Jaaguga (Allan comes together with Jaaga)
Machine translation: I will be able to come together with Jaaga
Reference translation: Allan has a meeting with Jaak

Difference: The source mentions ""Allan saab kokku"" (Allan comes together), which implies a meeting or gathering, while the machine translation says ""I will be able to come together,"" which suggests a future action rather than a current arrangement. The reference translation correctly captures the meeting aspect as ""has a meeting.""

Step 2: Identify the purpose of the meeting

Difference: The source specifies the topic of discussion as ""õmblusvabrikuga seonduvat"" (related to the sewing plant), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""heating plant."" The reference translation accurately translates this as ""the affairs of the sewing plant.""

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in two main aspects: it incorrectly suggests a future action (coming together) instead of a current arrangement (having a meeting), and it misinterprets the topic of discussion as a heating plant instead of a sewing plant.

Source: NATO avaldas Venemaa sissetungi tõendavad satelliidipildid.
Machine translation: NATO published the Russian invasion is evidenced by satellite images.

Difference 1: The machine translation adds the phrase ""is evidenced by"" which is not directly present in the source text. This implies a slightly different interpretation or structure.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.

1. **Sentence structure**: Both the machine translation (MT) and the reference translation (RT) maintain the same sentence structure, with a clear subject (""the question"") and a description of its complexity followed by the main point about the relevance of a non-reasoning consideration.

2. **Word choice**: The MT uses ""consideration"" twice, while the RT uses ""a consideration"" for the second instance. This is a minor difference, as both convey the same meaning.

3. **Omission of comma**: The MT omits the comma after ""one"" in ""complex one,"" which is a stylistic choice but does not change the meaning. The RT includes the comma, which is more common in English but not essential.

4. **Phrasing**: The MT uses ""which is not a reason"" as a single phrase, while the RT separates it with a comma, making it slightly clearer. However, both are grammatically correct.

5. **Irrelevance**: The MT uses ""completely irrelevant,"" while the RT omits ""completely."" This difference is minor, as ""irrelevant"" on its own implies a lack of relevance, but ""completely"" adds emphasis.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate, with only a few minor differences in style and punctuation. The meaning is preserved, and the core message is the same as in the reference translation.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""miscarriage"" (eksitust), which is a medical term that might not be appropriate in this context, as it implies a pregnancy loss, whereas the source text and reference translation use a more general term ""eksitust"" that could refer to any kind of error or misstep.
- The reference translation uses ""mistake"" (viga), which is a more suitable and less specific term than ""miscarriage"" in this context.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
The main difference is the choice of words ""miscarriage"" vs. ""mistake."" The machine translation has translated the source text more literally, which results in a less accurate translation in this case.

2. **Meaning of ""with"":** The machine translation uses ""with"" (in the sense of ""using""), which is not the most appropriate word choice here. The reference translation uses ""about,"" which indicates that the poems and songs are about a specific subject, which is ""him"" (referring to the symbol of Tallinn).

3. **Omission of ""about him"":** The machine translation omits the phrase ""about him"" from the source text, which is crucial to convey the intended meaning that the poems and songs are not just created but are specifically about the symbol.

4. **Sentence structure**: The reference translation maintains a more natural sentence structure, with ""and"" connecting two clauses about the symbol's status and the creation of poems and songs. The machine translation combines these ideas into a single sentence, making it less clear.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Darwin tegi retkel palju muidki avastusi, millest osa peeti eriti tähtsateks.
Machine translation: Darwin made many other discoveries on the journey, some of which were considered particularly important.

Step 2: Identify differences in sentence structure and word choice.
- The source text uses ""millest osa"" (of which part), which is a genitive construction to express that some of the discoveries were considered important. The machine translation omits this construction, using ""some of which"" instead.

Step 3: Check for accuracy of translation.
- The main subject, ""Darwin"" and the action ""tegi avastusi"" (made discoveries) are accurately translated.
- The phrase ""retkel"" (journey) is correctly translated.
- The adjective ""eriti tähtsateks"" (especially important) is translated as ""particularly important"", which conveys the same meaning.

Step 4: Evaluate the impact of the difference.
- The difference in the genitive construction might slightly affect the clarity of the sentence in the machine translation, as it omits the explicit connection between ""osa"" and ""muidki avastusi"". However, the meaning is still understandable.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the genitive construction. The overall meaning is preserved, and the translation is of high quality. The main issue is the loss of the genitive construction, which could be improved for a more natural-sounding English sentence.

Machine translation: He also has a brother Johan Exholm, who has not been seen in the horns.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: He also has a brother Johan Ekholm, who has not been seen in the series.

Step 4: Compare the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation
- In the machine translation, ""vend"" is translated as ""brother,"" which is correct but not the most accurate term in this context, as ""vend"" can mean both ""brother"" and ""friend"" in Estonian. The reference translation uses ""brother,"" which is more suitable.
- The machine translation has ""horns,"" which is a literal translation of ""sarjas"" (series) and does not make sense in this context. The reference translation uses ""series,"" which is the correct term for the context of a TV show or a book series.
- The rest of the sentence structure is similar in both translations, with the exception of ""nähtud"" (seen) which is correctly translated as ""seen"" in both.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the word choice for ""vend"" and the incorrect translation of ""sarjas"" as ""horns."" The correct term for ""brother"" and the context of ""series"" are used in the reference translation, making it of higher quality.

Source: Darwini nimi anti juba tema eluajal paljudele geograafilistele paikkondadele ja organismidele.
Machine translation: Darwin's name has already been given to many geographical locations and organisms during his lifetime.

Step 2: Identify differences in word order and structure.
- In the source text, ""juba tema eluajal"" (already during his lifetime) is placed at the end, while in the machine translation, it is placed at the beginning.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the difference.
- The difference in word order slightly changes the emphasis in the sentence. In the source, it emphasizes the fact that the naming occurred during Darwin's lifetime, while the machine translation places more emphasis on the fact that it has already happened.

Step 4: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Darwin 's name was already given to many geographical locations and organisms during his lifetime.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality.
- The machine translation captures the main idea but loses the original emphasis on the timeframe. The reference translation is more faithful to the original structure and meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of word order, which slightly alters the emphasis. While it conveys the core information, the reference translation is a more accurate representation of the source text's structure and emphasis.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: It has in mind moral ceilings as the starting point for discipline.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: He refers to the point of origin of moral philosophy as a discipline.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the source text
- The source text mentions ""moraalifilosoofia"" (moral philosophy) as the subject and ""alguspunkti"" (starting point) for ""distsipliini"" (discipline).
- The machine translation translates ""moraalifilosoofia"" as ""moral ceilings"" which is a misinterpretation, as it suggests a limit rather than the subject itself.
- The machine translation also uses ""as the starting point for discipline"" which is not directly equivalent to ""kui distsipliini alguspunkti"" in the source text.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly captures the meaning by stating ""the point of origin of moral philosophy"" and ""as a discipline.""
- It omits the word ""silmas"" (in mind) which might be an assumption in the translation, but the overall meaning is clear.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""moraalifilosoofia"" as ""moral ceilings"" instead of the subject itself. Additionally, it does not directly translate ""kui distsipliini alguspunkti"" as ""as the starting point for discipline,"" but rather as a part of that phrase.

Machine translation: Foreign ministers signed a communiqué for the conclusion of diplomatic relations.

The machine translation captures the main idea that foreign ministers signed a communiqué related to the conclusion of diplomatic relations. However, there are a few differences:

1. ""diplomaatiliste suhete sõlmimise"" (establishment of diplomatic relations) in the source text is translated as ""the conclusion of diplomatic relations"" in the machine translation.

Reference translation: Foreign ministers signed a communiqué for the conclusion of diplomatic relations.

The reference translation is identical to the machine translation, except for the absence of the word ""sõlmimise"" in the machine translation.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not include the word ""sõlmimise"" (establishment), which is important for conveying the full meaning of the source text.

2. **Reference translation**: ""It feels like a breath of fresh air compared to Plato.""
3. **Machine translation**: ""It looks like a friend of fresh air compared to Platon.""

**Analysis:**
- **""Võrreldes Platoniga""**: The source text uses ""võrreldes"" (comparing), which is a verb phrase, while the machine translation uses ""compared to"" (a prepositional phrase). This difference affects the structure of the sentence.
- **""tundub""**: The source verb ""tundub"" (feels) is translated as ""looks"" in the machine translation. Although both convey a sense of perception, ""looks"" is not the most accurate translation for the Estonian verb, which implies a subjective feeling.
- **""see""**: The source text uses ""see"" (this), which is translated as ""a friend"" in the machine translation. This is a direct translation error, as ""see"" is a pronoun and should be translated as ""it"" to maintain the subject.
- **""nagu sõõm värsket õhku""**: The source compares the subject to ""sõõm värsket õhku"" (a breath of fresh air). The machine translation omits the simile and instead says ""a friend of fresh air,"" which loses the poetic comparison.

**Final evaluation**: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation, as it alters the structure, uses an incorrect verb, and loses the simile that conveys the freshness of the comparison. The machine translation could be improved by using ""it feels"" instead of ""looks"" and maintaining the simile structure.

- Machine translation: ""The cumulative acquisition of innovation is, in principle, unlikely.""
- Reference translation: ""The cumulative acquisition of innovation is, even in principle, unlikely.""

The source sentence starts with ""Uudsuse kumulatiivne omandamine"" (Cumulative acquisition of innovation), which is translated as ""The cumulative acquisition of innovation"" in both the machine and reference translations. However, the source includes ""ka"" (also) after ""põhimõtteliselt"" (in principle), which is not present in the machine translation.

Step 2: Analyze the difference
- The machine translation omits the word ""ka"" after ""in principle,"" which softens the statement by adding an additional emphasis on the improbability (even in principle). The reference translation includes this word, which is crucial for conveying the intended meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the way it omits the word ""ka,"" which weakens the emphasis on the unlikely nature of cumulative innovation acquisition, even in principle.

- Machine translation: ""Put just a moment before the start of the first group [XXV general singer brakes XXV)""
- Reference translation: ""A moment before the start of the first concert of the [XXV Song FestivalXXV Song Festival""

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""Put just a moment"" which is not a natural phrase in English and does not convey the same meaning as ""A moment"" in the reference translation.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""XXV üldlaulupidu"" as ""XXV general singer brakes"" instead of ""XXV Song Festival,"" which is a significant error in context.
3. The machine translation includes ""[XXV]"" in brackets, which is likely a reference to a numbering or category but is not part of the original Estonian phrase. The reference translation omits this.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the incorrect interpretation of ""XXV üldlaulupidu"" and the awkward phrasing of ""Put just a moment."" The quality of the translation could be improved by accurately conveying the meaning of the source text and using more natural-sounding English.

Step 1: Compare the structure and meaning
- Both the machine translation (MT) and reference translation (RT) have a similar structure, with a subject (""an investigation"" or ""reseearch"") and a description of its quality (""confuses pure principles with empirics"" or ""confuses pure principles with empirical ones"").
- The main difference lies in the choice of words: ""empiirilistega"" in the source text is translated to ""empirical ones"" in the reference translation.

Step 2: Analyze the translation accuracy
- The translation from ""empiirilistega"" to ""empirical ones"" captures the essence of the source text, as both refer to the same concept of empirical principles.
- The verb ""vääri"" in the source text, which means ""deserve"" or ""be worthy of,"" is translated to ""deserve"" in both versions, maintaining the meaning.

Step 3: Evaluate the preservation of nuance
- The reference translation keeps the nuance of the source text, emphasizing that the investigation is not just unworthy of the label ""philosophy,"" but that it doesn't even have the right to be called by that name.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the choice of words (""empiirilistega"" vs. ""empirical ones""). The overall meaning and structure are preserved, and the nuance is maintained. The main difference is a stylistic choice, which does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.

1. **Subject identification**: The source text refers to ""kohtuprotsess sarimõrvar Juri Ustimenko üle"" (trial of serial killer Juri Ustimenko), while the machine translation incorrectly identifies Juri Ustimenko as a ""serial victim"" instead of a ""serial killer."" This is a significant difference in meaning.

2. **Location**: The source mentions ""Harju Maakohtus"" (Harju County Court), which is the correct location for the trial. The machine translation, however, omits the word ""Maakohtus"" and replaces it with ""Maaten,"" which is a misinterpretation.

3. **Sentence structure**: The source sentence is structured as ""toimus kohtuprotsess"" (a trial took place) followed by the details. The machine translation rephrases it to focus on the case of ""Harther Maaten"" and the nature of Juri Ustimenko, which is not the main point.

4. **Translation accuracy**: The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text, including the correct subject (serial killer), location (Harju County Court), and the context of the trial.

Reference translation: People and societies in general cannot be treated like this without destroying the object of research.

Step 2: Identify differences in translation.
- Machine translation: ""the destruction of research facilities""
- Reference translation: ""destroying the object of research""

Step 3: Analyze the difference.
The machine translation uses ""research facilities"" which is a broader term that could include multiple aspects of a research setup, while the reference translation specifies ""the object of research,"" which is more precise and refers to the specific focus or target of the investigation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality.
The machine translation is not entirely incorrect, but it is less precise than the reference translation. It might lead to a slightly different interpretation, as ""research facilities"" could imply physical buildings, equipment, or infrastructure, whereas ""the object of research"" is more about the subject matter or study itself.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of decent quality but loses some nuance and precision compared to the reference translation. It would be more accurate if it were rephrased as ""People and societies in general cannot be treated like this without destroying the research object.""

Step 3: Analyze differences
- ""The basis for the interesting provision"" vs ""The basis for the indexed indication"" - The machine translation uses ""interesting provision"" which is not directly translated from ""Indeksilise osutamise alus"" and might be a misinterpretation. The reference translation uses ""indexed indication"" which is a more accurate translation of the source term.

- ""predict"" vs ""predict"" - Both translations use the same verb, but the context is slightly different due to the use of ""parties"" vs ""objects.""
- ""in the future"" vs ""in the future"" - Both translations have this part correctly.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific term ""Indeksilise osutamise alus"" being translated as ""interesting provision"" (which is not accurate), and the use of ""parties"" instead of ""objects"" which changes the meaning slightly. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text in terms of object correlations and the concept of indexed indication.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Mõnikord aga ei ole konflikti eri armastustest tulevate motivatsioonide vahel, nii et meil pole allikat ega kohta ühelegi neist vastuseismiseks.""
- Machine translation: ""Sometimes, however, there is no conflict between the motivation that comes from different love, so we have no source and no place to oppose any of them.""

Step 2: Identify differences in word order or phrasing.
- The machine translation has ""love"" instead of ""armastustest"" (plural form of ""love"" in Estonian). This might be a minor difference, as ""love"" can be understood as referring to multiple loves.
- The phrase ""vastuseismiseks"" in the source text is translated as ""to oppose any of them"" in the machine translation. The meaning is preserved, but the word order is slightly different.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences.
- The change from ""armastustest"" to ""love"" might slightly alter the emphasis, but it's still clear that the source text refers to multiple sources of motivation.
- The difference in word order does not change the overall meaning significantly.

Conclusion: The machine translation captures the essence of the source text, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. The meaning is mostly preserved, and the differences do not significantly affect the quality of the translation. The main issue is the loss of the plural form ""armastustest"" in the translation, which could slightly alter the emphasis, but overall, the translation is of good quality.

- Machine translation: ""In 1998 Buyoya announced a transitional constitution and a partnership between the government and the opposition National Assembly.""

Difference: The machine translation omits the adjective ""opositsioonilise"" (oppositional) from ""Rahvuskogu"" (National Assembly), which is crucial for accurately conveying the context.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""In 1998 Buyoya announced a transitional constitution and a partnership between the government and the opposition National Assembly.""
- Reference translation: ""In 1998 Buyoya announced a transitional constitution and a partnership between the government and the oppositional National Assembly.""

Difference: The reference translation includes the correct adjective ""oppositional"" to describe the National Assembly, which is consistent with the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not include the adjective ""oppositional"" to accurately describe the relationship between the government and the National Assembly. The reference translation provides a more precise and faithful translation of the source text.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Need vaatlused olid selles mõttes objektiivsed, et need sisaldasid rutiinseid protseduure, mis annaksid praegu suuresti sama tulemuse.
Machine translation: These observations were objective in that they included routine procedures that would, today, to a large extent produce the same result.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- The source text uses ""praeegu"" (literally, ""nowadays"" or ""at the moment""), while the machine translation uses ""today"". Although ""today"" is a suitable translation, ""praeegu"" might be more precise in this context, as it implies a specific point in time rather than a general day.
- The source text has a comma after ""proseduure"", while the machine translation omits it. This is a minor difference and does not affect the meaning significantly.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: These observations were objective in that they included routine procedures that would, today, to a large extent produce the same result.
Reference translation: These observations were objective in that they included routine procedures that would , today , to a large extent produce the same result.

The machine translation is almost identical to the reference translation, with the only difference being the comma after ""today"". The translation is accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text effectively.

Source: Komisjoni otsus jõustub päev pärast selle avaldamist Riigi Teatajas.
Machine translation: The Commission's decision will enter into force day after its publication in its Official Journal.

Step 2: Identify differences in vocabulary and structure.
- ""Komisjoni otsus"" (Commission's decision) is translated correctly.
- ""jõustub"" (enters into force) is translated accurately.
- ""päev pärast"" (day after) is a direct translation, but it's more common to use ""a day after"" in English.
- ""selle avaldamist"" (its publication) is translated correctly.
- ""Riigi Teatajas"" (Official Journal) is replaced with ""its Official Journal"", which is a more formal and standard English phrase.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the differences.
- The main difference is the use of ""a day after"" instead of ""päev pärast"", which is a minor change in phrasing.
- The reference translation uses ""State Gazette"" instead of ""Official Journal"", which is a more specific term for Estonian legal publications. This might be a more accurate translation, as ""Official Journal"" could refer to any official publication, not necessarily the specific one in Estonia.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the phrase ""day after"" and a potentially more specific term ""State Gazette"" instead of ""Official Journal"". The core meaning is preserved, but the reference translation offers a more contextually appropriate choice of words. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement in terms of cultural and terminology adaptation.

1. **Subject**: In the reference translation, the subject is ""subsequent theorists,"" which is more precise than ""subsequent theories"" in the machine translation. The machine translation might imply a broader range of theories, while the reference specifies the people who propose the idea.

2. **Action**: The reference uses ""use a scientific theory as a model,"" which indicates that the ethical system should take inspiration or adopt a scientific theory for guidance. The machine translation, on the other hand, says ""set an example by scientific theory,"" which could be interpreted as the ethical system needing to be based on scientific theory or serve as a role model in that context.

3. **Verb tense**: The reference uses the present tense ""have assumed,"" which is consistent with the source text, while the machine translation uses ""have assumed,"" but the structure is slightly different, which might not affect the meaning significantly.

4. **Structure**: The reference maintains the original structure of the source text more closely, with ""that an ethical system"" coming after ""have assumed,"" whereas the machine translation rearranges it slightly.

In conclusion, the machine translation captures the essence of the source text but with some differences in precision and structure. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian, particularly in specifying the subject and the action of using a scientific theory as a model.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Kratylos 402a) Selle tsitaadi esimest osa peetakse mitteehtsaks.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Kratylos 402a) The first part of this quotation is considered non-linear.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Kratylos 402a) The first part of this quote is considered non-authentic.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""non-linear"" while the reference translation uses ""non-authentic.""
- The context of the source text suggests that the issue is about the credibility or authenticity of the quote, not its linearity in a mathematical or narrative sense.

Step 5: Analyze the difference
The difference lies in the choice of words. ""Non-linear"" typically refers to a lack of a straightforward or predictable sequence, which does not fit the context of evaluating the quote's authenticity. ""Non-authentic"" is a more appropriate term in this context, as it directly addresses the question of whether the first part of the quote is genuine or not.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it uses ""non-linear"" instead of ""non-authentic,"" which is a more accurate term for the context provided. The reference translation better captures the intended meaning of the source text.

Step 1: Identify the main concepts in the source text
- Norra ajaloolised piirkonnad (Norwegian historic regions)
- Norra ajaloolised maakonnad (Norway's historic counties)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""Norwegian historic regions Norway's historic counties in Norwegian cities""
- Reference translation: ""Norwegian historic regions Norway 's historic counties Norwegian urban regions""

Step 3: Analyze differences
1. The machine translation combines ""Norwegian historic counties"" with ""Norwegian cities"" into one phrase, while the reference translation separates them as ""Norwegian historic counties"" and ""Norwegian urban regions.""
2. The machine translation uses ""in Norwegian cities,"" which implies that the historic counties are located within cities, while the reference translation uses ""Norwegian urban regions,"" which suggests a broader context that includes both cities and potentially towns or other urban areas.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality
The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it incorrectly implies that the historic counties are specifically within cities, whereas the reference translation provides a clearer distinction between historic counties and urban areas in general. The reference translation is more faithful to the original source text in terms of meaning and structure.

|Machine translation: Galileo had strong arguments for the truth of its observations.|
|Reference translation: Galileo had strong arguments for the truth of his observations.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Subject pronoun**: The source text uses ""oma"" (his) to refer to Galileo's observations, while the machine translation uses ""its"" which is incorrect. The correct pronoun to use in this context is ""his"" as in the reference translation, to indicate that the observations belong to Galileo.

2. **Omission of possessive pronoun**: The reference translation includes the possessive pronoun ""his"" before ""observations"" to clarify that the observations are Galileo's. The machine translation omits this, leading to a less clear meaning.

3. **Word order**: The word order in the machine translation is slightly different from the reference, but the meaning is still understandable. The source text places ""tõepärasuse"" (truth) after ""argumendid"" (arguments), while the machine translation reverses the order. However, the reference translation follows a more natural English word order.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the use of the possessive pronoun ""his"" and the word order, which affects clarity and accuracy. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian text.

- ""Ülalolevas tabelis"" (above table)
- ""kirjeldavad"" (describe)
- ""paksus kirjas"" (pairs of numbers)
- ""partiide tulemusi"" (party results)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""The overall table describes the results of the batches of the numbers couple written in the package,""
- Reference translation: ""In the above table, the pairs if numbers in bold describe the results games,""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- ""Ülalolevas"" (above) is translated as ""The overall"" which is a close approximation but not exact.
- ""tabelis"" (table) is translated as ""table"" which is correct.
- ""kirjeldavad"" (describe) is translated as ""describes"" which is accurate.
- ""paksus kirjas"" (pairs of numbers) is translated as ""batches of the numbers couple written in the package"" which is not equivalent to the reference. The reference mentions ""numbers in bold"" which implies the emphasis on the pairs, not necessarily that they are written in a package.
- ""partiide tulemusi"" (party results) is translated as ""results of the batches"" which omits the context of ""partiide"" (parties) and implies a different meaning.

Step 4: Conclusion.
The machine translation has some differences in accuracy and context compared to the reference translation. It loses the emphasis on the bold numbers and the specific connection to party results. The reference translation is clearer about the numbers being pairs and their relation to game results, while the machine translation suggests they are batches from a package, which is not the same meaning.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Supposedly, when one of them went between the dead, one of the naked semi-dead Estonians jumped up and wanted to kill the citizen.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""lained surnute vahele"" (between the dead), while the reference translation uses ""lained"" (went) and implies the action of going between the dead with ""when one of them went.""
- The machine translation states ""karanud üks alasti poolsurnud"" (one of the naked semi-dead), while the reference translation omits ""alasti"" (naked) and uses ""jumped up"" to convey the action, which is not directly translated in the machine translation.
- The machine translation uses ""tahtnud kodanikku tappa"" (wanted to kill a citizen), which is a direct translation. The reference translation also has this part, but with a slight difference in emphasis (""wanted to kill"" vs ""to kill"").

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation has some differences in phrasing and action description compared to the reference translation. It loses the nuance of the Estonian text, such as the implied action of ""going"" and the description of the Estonian's action as ""jumped up"" instead of ""naked.""

The machine translation correctly identifies this as ""The Falsificist system,"" which is a broader term that encompasses the individual or the philosophical approach. The reference translation uses ""A falsificationist,"" which is more specific and refers to an individual, but still conveys the same idea.

2. **Verb**: Both translations use ""avoids"" to express the same action in the source text.

3. **Predicate**: The main difference lies in the phrase ""öeldes, et teadus ei kasuta induktsiooni"" in the source text. The machine translation renders this as ""saying that science does not use induction,"" which is a direct and accurate translation. The reference translation, ""by saying that science does not use induction,"" is also correct but omits the word ""öeldes"" (saying), which slightly changes the emphasis but does not alter the meaning.

3. **Year**: ""2011"" is correctly preserved in both translations.
4. **Difference**: The main issue lies in the interpretation of ""sai 107 kohta"" (received 107) in the source text. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""107 places of GDP,"" which suggests a physical quantity or division, while the reference translation correctly renders it as ""received 107 seats,"" implying a numerical allocation or representation.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation because it incorrectly translates ""sai 107 kohta"" as ""107 places of GDP,"" which does not convey the intended meaning of the source text, which is about the number of seats or positions that GDP received in the context of the National Assembly.

Analysis:

1. **""säästuauto mudelit"" vs ""economy car model"":** The machine translation uses ""saving car model"" which is a direct translation of ""säästuauto mudelit"" but might not convey the same meaning as ""economy car model"" in English. The reference translation uses ""economy car model,"" which is a more accurate term to describe a car designed for fuel efficiency or affordability.

2. **""valitsenud"" vs ""the current market leader"":** The machine translation uses ""who has ruled the market for energy-saving cars so far"" to convey the idea of Tata Nanole being dominant, but it's not as clear as the reference translation's ""the current market leader."" The reference directly states Tata Nano's position as the leader, which is more precise.

3. **""seni"" vs ""so far"":** Both translations use ""so far,"" which is a suitable equivalent for ""seni"" in this context, indicating the Tata Nanole's dominance up until the introduction of the Bajaj RE60.

|Reference translation: As a result , all univocalates are essentially the same , which is false , because that is how man and donkey are essentially the same . ""
|Analysis:|
1. The source text refers to ""univokaatsed,"" which is a term that likely refers to something specific, possibly a concept or term from Estonian literature or philosophy. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""sleeping peanuts,"" which is a nonsensical phrase and does not convey the intended meaning.
2. The reference translation uses ""donkey"" (in Estonian, ""õmblus"") as an example, which is a fitting parallel to ""man"" in the context, as it is a contrasting example to illustrate the point. The machine translation, however, uses ""the mother,"" which does not fit the context and does not create the same contrast.
3. The structure of the sentence is also slightly different in the machine translation, with ""which is false"" placed after ""essentially the same,"" while in the reference translation, it follows ""all univocalates."" This change affects the flow and clarity of the sentence.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of the meaning and context, as well as the choice of examples. The translation should be focused on conveying the idea that univocalates are essentially the same when they are false, using a contrasting example like ""man"" and ""donkey"" to illustrate the point, rather than ""sleeping peanuts"" and ""the mother.""|im_end|

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the subject
- Source: ""Paavst"" (The Pope)
- Machine translation: ""The Pope""
- Reference translation: ""The Pope""
Both translations correctly identify the subject as ""The Pope.""

Step 2: Compare the verb and tense
- Source: ""tundis"" (felt/expressed concern, past tense)
- Machine translation: ""was concerned"" (past tense, passive voice)
- Reference translation: ""expressed"" (past tense, active voice)
The machine translation uses ""was concerned"" in the passive voice, while the reference translation uses ""expressed"" in the active voice. The meaning is similar, but the active voice is more direct and commonly used in English for this context.

Step 3: Compare the object and additional information
- Source: ""9. jaanuaril 2011"" (on 9 January 2011)
- Machine translation: ""9 January 2011""
- Reference translation: ""on 9 January 2011""
Both translations convey the same date, but the reference translation includes ""on"" for better clarity in English.

Step 4: Compare the context
- Source: ""muret Haiti olukorra pärast"" (concern about the situation in Haiti after)
- Machine translation: ""about the situation in Haiti""
- Reference translation: ""about the situation in Haiti""
The machine translation omits the word ""after"" or ""pärast,"" which is not strictly necessary in English but could provide a more complete understanding of the Pope's action.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, capturing the main points of the source text. However, it loses some nuance by using the passive voice instead of the active voice for the verb ""expressed concern"" and omits the word ""after"" to indicate the timing of the Pope's concern.

|Source: Liivimaal kogunenud riialaste, liivlaste ja latgalite sõjavägi liikus Sakalasse, kus nendega liitusid ugalased ja nendega koos olnud sakslased.|
|Machine translation: The army of rivals, widowns and lagese gathered in the country of the Union went to Sakala, where they were joined by the Chinese and joined by the Germans.|
|Reference translation: The armies of Riga , Livonians and Latgalians gathered in Livonia moved to Sakala , where they were joined by Ugrians and the Germans who had accompanied them.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Liivimaal kogunenud""** (Source) vs. **""The army of rivals, widowns and lagese gathered in the country of the Union""** (Machine) - The machine translation incorrectly identifies ""riialaste"" (rival soldiers) as ""rivals"" and omits the context of ""Liivimaal"" (Livonia), which is crucial for understanding the location.
2. **""liivlaste ja latgalite sõjavägi""** (Source) vs. **""widowns and lagese""** (Machine) - The machine translation mistranslates ""liivlaste"" (Livonians) and ""latgalite"" (Latvians) as ""widowns"" and ""lagese"" respectively, which are not accurate translations.
3. **""liikus Sakalasse""** (Source) vs. **""went to Sakala""** (Machine) - The verb ""liikus"" (marched or moved) is translated as ""went,"" but the context of the movement to Sakala is not changed, which is correct.
4. **""kus nendega liitusid ugalased""** (Source) vs. **""where they were joined by the Chinese""** (Machine) - The machine translation introduces ""Chinese"" which is not present in the source text. The correct translation should be ""Ugrians.""
5. **""ja nendega koos olnud sakslased""** (Source) vs. **""and joined by the Germans who had accompanied them""** (Reference) - The machine translation omits the part about the Germans accompanying the armies, which is present in the reference translation.

In summary, the machine translation has significant inaccuracies in identifying the correct groups (Livonians, Latvians, and Ugrians), mistranslates ""riialaste"" and ""latgalite,"" and introduces an incorrect element (Chinese). The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Aastal 1877 proovis ta isa pealekäimisel sooritada Jihlava gümnaasiumis küpsuseksamid.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: In 1877, he attempted to use his father's sleight of cyclone in Jihping's synasium.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In 1877 , when his father approached , he tried to take maturity exams at Jihlava Gymnasium.

Step 4: Compare the source and machine translation
- The source mentions ""proovis ta isa pealekäimisel"" (he tried when his father approached), which is not accurately translated as ""to use his father's sleight of cyclone"" in the machine translation. The phrase suggests a specific event, likely related to his father's presence, not a magical ability.
- The machine translation has ""Jihping's synasium"" instead of ""Jihlava gümnaasiumis"" (at Jihlava Gymnasium), which is a mistranslation of the place name.
- The machine translation omits the concept of ""küpsuseksamid"" (maturity exams) from the source, which is crucial to understanding the context.

Step 5: Compare the source and reference translation
- The reference translation captures the correct time frame (""In 1877"") and the event of trying to take exams (""he tried to take maturity exams"").
- It also accurately translates the location as ""Jihlava Gymnasium"" and conveys the father's involvement (""when his father approached"").

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the event description, the father's role, and the correct translation of the place name. The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Ahvenale saabub külaline, keda ta isegi unes oodata ei osanud.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The Ahmed will be a guest whom he could not even have expected in his dream.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Ahven gets a visitor he could have never even dreamed of.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""Ahvenale saabub külaline"" (Ahven gets a visitor), while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""The Ahmed will be a guest.""
- The source text uses ""keda ta isegi unes oodata ei osanud"" (whom he could not even have expected in his dream), which implies that the visitor was unexpected even in the person's dreams. The machine translation, however, changes this to ""whom he could not even have expected in his dream,"" which is a similar but not identical phrasing.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text by saying ""Ahven gets a visitor he could have never even dreamed of,"" which directly translates the idea of an unexpected visitor.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:
- It incorrectly attributes the visitor to ""The Ahmed"" instead of ""Ahven.""
- The reference translation is more concise and direct, while the machine translation has a slightly more complex structure.

To improve the quality, the machine translation could be revised to: ""Ahven gets a visitor he never could have dreamed of."" This would better align with the reference translation and convey the intended meaning of the source text.

|Reference translation: The Council of the Union set up a Commission to examine the situation, composed of representatives of Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain.|

|Analysis|
1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same essential information: the Council of the Union established a commission to investigate a situation, and the commission includes representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China, and Spain.
2. The sentence structure is similar in both versions, with the exception of a comma after ""Spain"" in the machine translation. This comma is not present in the reference translation, but it does not change the meaning significantly.
3. The word ""kuulusid"" in the source text, which means ""belonged to"" or ""were part of"" in this context, is translated as ""composed of"" in both translations. This is a suitable equivalent.

1. **Source**: The source text uses ""suurema teose"" which refers to a ""larger work"" in Estonian. This is a direct translation of the concept.
2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation uses ""writing more work"" instead of ""suurema teose"", which is not as precise as the reference. ""More work"" could imply any additional work, not necessarily a larger piece.
3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation keeps the original meaning by using ""writing a larger work.""

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference in its choice of words, specifically by using ""more work"" instead of ""larger work"", which might lead to a less clear understanding of the intended meaning. The reference translation is more accurate in conveying the idea that a larger work became an alternative due to the difficulty of writing a brief article.

Difference 1: In the source, ""Tõlkinud ja kommenteerinud"" refers to ""translated and commented"" by Urmas Eelmäe, while the machine translation incorrectly uses ""The translates"" instead of ""translated and commented by"".

Difference 2: The source mentions ""toimetanud"" which means ""delivered"" by Enn Tarvel, but the machine translation omits this part, making it unclear who delivered the work.

Source: Keskaegse lossi jäänused on olnud avatud alates 2006. aastast.
Machine translation: The remains of the medieval Castle have been open since 2006.

Step 2: Identify differences in translation.
- ""Keskaegse lossi"" (medieval loss) in the source text is translated as ""medieval Castle"" in the machine translation. The word ""loss"" in Estonian refers to a ""loss"" or ""ruin"" but in this context, it likely means ""castle"" or ""fortress"" as it is a historical site.
- ""on olnud avatud"" (have been open) is the same in both translations.
- ""alates 2006. aastast"" (since 2006) is also the same.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
- The reference translation is identical to the machine translation, except for the trailing period at the end, which is optional in English but included in the reference.

Step 4: Conclusion.
The machine translation captures the main meaning of the source text accurately, with a slight difference in the word choice for ""loss"" (which is translated as ""Castle"" instead of ""ruin"" or ""fortress""). The time frame ""since 2006"" is correctly translated. The only difference from the reference translation is the absence of the period at the end, which does not affect the meaning.

5. **""Linnuõpe loodusainete õpetajatele""** (for teachers of nature subjects, specifically birds) - Machine translation: ""Urban learning for teachers of natural materials"" (incorrect, it changes the focus from bird education to urban learning and materials)

The main difference lies in the translation of the phrase ""Linnuõpe loodusainete õpetajatele,"" which is about bird education for nature teachers, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it to ""Urban learning for teachers of natural materials."" The reference translation accurately captures the subject matter of the project, which is about birds.

|Reference translation: Kristiina Ojuland, was elected by the assembly as President of the party, and the party statute and programme were approved.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Subject and title**: The source mentions ""erakonna esimeheks"" (party chairperson), while the machine translation uses ""President of the party"" and the reference translation refers to ""President of the party"". The difference here is that ""esimeheks"" is a more specific term for chairperson, and ""President"" is a broader term that could also include a leader with executive powers. The reference translation captures this distinction more accurately.

2. **Election description**: The source uses ""valiti"" (elected), while the machine translation and reference translation both use ""was elected"". The verb tense is consistent in both, but the source is in the passive voice, and the translations are in the active voice, which is more common in English.

3. **Assembly reference**: The source does not explicitly mention ""assembly"" but implies it with ""üldkogul"" (collectively). The machine translation adds ""to the assembly"" for clarity, while the reference translation omits it. The reference translation might be slightly less clear about the context, but it is still understandable.

4. **Confirmation of documents**: The source uses ""kinnitati"" (confirmed), while the machine translation uses ""confirmed"" and the reference translation uses ""approved"". Both ""confirmed"" and ""approved"" convey the same meaning, but ""approved"" is a more common term in English.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate, with some minor differences in nuance and structure. The reference translation is also accurate but might be slightly less explicit about the context of the assembly. The main difference lies in the choice of terms for the party leadership position.

   - Machine translation: ""signs of the early colonisation of the Abkhazians""
   - Reference translation: ""signs of early aboriginal settlements""

   The machine translation incorrectly translates ""aborigeenide varasest asustusest"" (signs of the early settlement of the Aborigines) as ""the early colonisation of the Abkhazians,"" which is a different ethnic group and does not match the context of the source text, which is about the indigenous people of Australia.

2. **Difference in the name ""Tidbinbillale"":**

Step 1: Identify key phrases and words in the source text
- ""Osutamine ise"" (Denoting itself)
- ""hierarhilise struktuuriga"" (hierarchical structure)
- "" keerukamad osutamise vormid"" (more complex forms of denoting)
- ""ehitatakse üles"" (are built up)
- ""lihtsamatest"" (simpler forms)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- ""Separation itself"" vs ""Denoting itself"" - The machine translation uses ""Separation"" instead of ""Denoting"", which is a significant difference as the context is about denoting or indicating something, not physical separation.
- ""hierarchical structure"" is correctly translated in both.
- ""more complex forms of supply"" vs ""more complex forms of denoting"" - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""osutamise"" (supply) as ""supply"", which should be ""denoting"" to match the source.
- ""built up with simpler forms"" vs ""built from simpler forms"" - The structure is similar, but ""with"" is replaced by ""from"" in the machine translation, which is a minor difference but still affects the meaning slightly.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation has several differences from the reference translation, primarily in the choice of words ""Separation"" instead of ""Denoting"" and ""supply"" instead of ""denoting"". These differences affect the overall meaning and accuracy of the translation. The reference translation better captures the original Estonian text's intent, maintaining the hierarchical structure and the process of building complex forms from simpler ones.

- Machine translation: ""Until the beginning of the 17th century, the Swedish navy had consisted mainly of smaller, one-size-fits-all bases with relatively easy cannons.""

Difference 1: The source text uses ""väiksematest ühetekilistest alustest"" (smaller, one-size-fits-all bases), while the machine translation uses ""smaller, one-size-fits-all bases with relatively easy cannons."" The machine translation adds the detail about ""relatively easy cannons"" which is not directly present in the source.

Step 2: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
- Source: ""Kuni 17. sajandi alguseni oli Rootsi merevägi koosnenud peamiselt väiksematest ühetekilistest alustest suhteliselt kergete kahuritega.""
- Reference translation: ""Until the beginning of the 17th century, the Swedish navy had consisted mainly of smaller, single-deck vessels with relatively light cannons.""

Difference 2: The reference translation omits the phrase ""suhteliselt kergete kahuritega"" (relatively small cannons) from the source and instead uses ""single-deck vessels with relatively light cannons."" This change suggests that the reference translation is focusing on the type of vessels (single-deck) and the quality of their cannons (light) rather than the cannons being specifically small.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in two aspects:
1. It adds the detail about ""relatively easy cannons"" which is not directly present in the source text.
2. It omits the phrase ""suhteliselt kergete kahuritega"" and instead specifies ""single-deck vessels with relatively light cannons,"" which changes the emphasis on the cannons.

To evaluate the quality, the machine translation loses some accuracy in terms of the original source's description and adds a detail that is not in the source. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a clearer and more concise translation that focuses on the type of vessels and their cannons. Overall, the reference translation is of higher quality.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start| Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Sõjas sai kõige rängemalt kannatada just Eesti mandriosa.

|im_start| Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: It was precisely the Estonian mainland that was hardest hit by the war.

|im_start| Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: It was precisely the Estonian mainland that was hardest hit by the war.

|im_start| Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation has ""just Eesti mandriosa"" which seems to be a literal translation of ""just Eesti mandriosa"" without a clear meaning in English. The reference translation omits this phrase, likely because it is not necessary for the meaning of the sentence or might be a less common way of expressing the same idea.

|im_start| Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The main difference is the inclusion of ""just Eesti mandriosa"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference translation. ""Mandriosa"" is likely a regional or specific term that might not have a direct equivalent in English, or it could be a typo or a mistranslation.

|im_start| Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it includes a phrase (""just Eesti mandriosa"") that is not present in the reference and might not be necessary or accurately translated. The core meaning of the sentence is the same, but the machine translation could be improved by removing or clarifying the term ""mandriosa"" if it is not essential to the context.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Detsembris toimusidki ägedad lahingud, eriti Narva all, kuid Eesti kaitse pidas vastu.""
- Machine translation: ""In December, there were fierce battles, particularly under the Nys, but Estonia's protection resisted.""

Difference 1: The source text uses ""Narva all"" (literally ""under Narva""), while the machine translation uses ""under the Nys."" It seems like ""Nys"" is a mistranslation or an error, as it is not a common term in English. The correct translation should be ""under Narva.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""In December, there were fierce battles, particularly under the Nys, but Estonia's protection resisted.""
- Reference translation: ""In December, there were fierce battles, particularly under Narva, but Estonia's defences held.""

Difference 2: The machine translation uses ""protection resisted,"" while the reference translation uses ""defences held."" ""Defences"" is a more accurate term for the context, as it refers to the military or defensive structures, whereas ""protection"" can be more general and might not convey the same level of intensity.

Conclusion:
The machine translation has two main differences from the reference translation:
1. Incorrect translation of ""Narva all"" as ""under the Nys.""
2. Incorrect use of ""protection resisted"" instead of ""defences held,"" which is a more precise term for the context.

To improve the quality of the translation, the machine translation should be revised to say: ""In December, there were fierce battles, particularly under Narva, but Estonia's defences held.""

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly identical, with only a minor difference in punctuation. The source text uses a comma after ""Kopenhaagenis"" (Copenhagen), while the reference translation omits the comma. This difference is likely due to the style of punctuation used in the source, which might be a typographical error or a stylistic choice. Other than this, the sentence structure and meaning are preserved in both translations.

The key elements that match between the two translations are:
1. Location: ""Taanis Kopenhaagenis"" (In Denmark)
2. Event: ""Euroopa Liidu välisministrite kahepäevane mitteametlik kohtumine"" (two days of informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers)
3. Participants: ""Eesti välisminister Urmas Paet"" (the Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet)

The machine translation is of high quality, with the main issue being a minor punctuation inconsistency. The meaning and context are accurately conveyed, and the translation is faithful to the source text.

|im_start|>|im_end|
The machine translation and the reference translation are identical, except for the trailing period at the end of the sentence. The source text in Estonian does not have a period, so the machine translation should also not include one if it is following the standard English punctuation rules. Here's the analysis:

1. The subject ""Aastal 2006"" (Year 2006) is translated correctly as ""In 2006"" in both versions.
2. ""valiti ta ametisse"" (was elected to the position) is translated accurately as ""he was elected for a term of office.""
3. ""teiseks ametiajaks"" (for a second term) is also translated correctly as ""a second term.""
4. The only difference is the presence of a period at the end of the machine translation, which is not present in the source or reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with the only difference being the inclusion of an unnecessary period at the end. If the goal is to adhere strictly to the source text, the machine translation should be adjusted to match the reference translation without the period: ""In 2006 he was elected for a second term of office.""

|Reference translation: The three Presidents were also congratulated by George W. Bush, President of the United States, on the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Baltic Charter.|

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""Ühtlasi õnnitles"" which means ""congratulated together"" in English. The machine translation correctly captures this as ""The three Presidents also congratulated"".
2. The source mentions ""Balti harta allkirjastamise"" which refers to ""signing of the Baltic Charter"". The machine translation accurately translates this as ""the signing of the Baltic Charter"".
3. The source uses ""Ameerika Ühendriikide president"" for ""President of the United States"". The machine translation omits the possessive ""Ameerika Ühendriikide"" and instead uses ""President of the United States"", which is correct but less specific.
4. The verb ""õnnitles"" in the source is passive, indicating that the congratulation was given to George W. Bush. The machine translation uses the active form ""congratulated"", which is also correct but loses the passive aspect.

The main difference between the machine and reference translations is the passive voice in the source, which is not explicitly expressed in the machine translation. The reference translation maintains the passive structure, making it clearer that the congratulation was given to George W. Bush. Other than that, the translations are largely accurate and convey the same meaning.

- Machine translation: ""A week later, in the Holy Haua Church, a passion council was called to appoint a kingdom to the new Jerusalem Queen.""

Difference: The machine translation uses ""passion council"" instead of ""church council"" (kirkunõukogu), which is a mistranslation. Additionally, it refers to ""new Jerusalem Queen"" instead of ""new Jerusalem Kingdom"" (kuningriigile kuningas).

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""A week later, in the Holy Haua Church, a passion council was called to appoint a kingdom to the new Jerusalem Queen.""
- Reference translation: ""A week later, a church council was assembled in the Holy Tomb Church to appoint a king for the new Jerusalem Kingdom.""

Difference: The machine translation has ""passion council"" instead of ""church council"" (Holy Tomb Church), which is a different context. It also refers to ""king"" instead of ""kuningas"" (king for the new Jerusalem Kingdom), which is a change in the subject.

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the type of council (passion council vs. church council) and the role being appointed (king vs. kuningas).

Machine translation: According to unofficial information, 10 Chadian soldiers died in the military operation.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- The source text uses ""Mitteametlikel andmetel"" (unofficial data) which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it is translated as ""According to unofficial information.""
- The source text has no additional punctuation or capitalization, while the machine translation adds a comma after ""information"" and capitalizes ""soldiers.""

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""kreeka keelt"" (Greek language), while the machine translation and reference translation both use ""Greek"" without specifying the language. This is a minor difference, but the reference translation is more precise.
2. The source text includes ""kirjandust"" (literature), which is correctly translated as ""literature"" in both the machine translation and reference translation.
3. The machine translation and reference translation correctly translate ""sporti"" (sport) as ""sport"".
4. ""Teadust"" (science) is translated accurately as ""science"" in both.

- Source: ""Aruandes nimetati Iisraeli tegevust poliitiliseks ja sõjaliseks ebaõnnestumiseks""
- Machine translation: ""The report describes Israel's actions as a political and military failure""
- Difference: The machine translation omits the possessive pronoun ""Aruandes"" (from the report) and the verb ""nimetati"" (labeled or named). It also changes the word order slightly.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""The report describes Israel's actions as a political and military failure and mainly denounced the lack of a proper military strategy.""
- Reference translation: ""The report describes Israel 's actions as a political and military failure and mainly denounced the lack of a proper military strategy.""
- Difference: The reference translation adds the apostrophe after ""Israel"" to indicate possession, which is missing in the machine translation. Apart from that, the meaning and structure are the same.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
1. It omits the possessive pronoun ""Aruandes"" and the verb ""nimetati"" from the source text.
2. It does not include the apostrophe after ""Israel"" in the reference translation, which is a minor grammatical difference.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should include the possessive reference and the verb ""nimetati"" to maintain the original meaning and context. Additionally, adding the apostrophe after ""Israel"" would make the translation more accurate.

Step 1: Compare the subject and main verb
- Source: Musk on külastanud (Musk has visited)
- Machine translation: The Roma have visited

The machine translation incorrectly attributes the visit to ""The Roma"" instead of Musk. This is a significant difference.

Step 2: Compare the festival name and details
- Source: festivali Burning Man (Burning Man festival)

The machine translation combines ""Burning"" and ""Man"" into a single phrase, which is not accurate. The correct name is ""Burning Man"" without the conjunction.

Step 3: Compare the statement about the SolarCity idea
- Source: on öelnud, et SolarCity idee tuli talle esmakordselt pähe 2004. aasta festivalil (said that the idea of SolarCity came to him for the first time at the 2004 festival)
- Machine translation: have said that the idea of SolarCity came to mind for the first time at the 2004 festival
- Reference translation: said that the idea of the SolarCity came to his mind for the first time at the 2004 festival

The machine translation omits the possessive pronoun ""talle"" (to him) and uses ""the idea of SolarCity"" instead of ""SolarCity idee"" (SolarCity idea), which is a minor difference but still affects clarity.

Conclusion:
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the subject (attributing the visit to ""The Roma"" instead of Musk) and the festival name (""Burning and Man"" instead of ""Burning Man"").

|Machine translation: The surviving crew members were intercepted one by one and were asked how the ship had been dealt with during the accident.|
|Reference translation: The surviving crew members were questioned one by one and were asked how the ship had been handled during the accident.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""kuulati ükshaaval üle"" which means ""were questioned one by one"" in Estonian. The machine translation correctly captures this as ""were intercepted one by one"", but it might be slightly less accurate because ""intercepted"" implies a more forceful or unexpected action than a simple questioning process.
2. The source text uses ""kuidas laevaga"" which means ""how with the ship"" or ""how the ship was managed"". The machine translation translates this as ""how the ship had been dealt with"", which is a close approximation but might be slightly less precise, as ""dealt with"" could imply a broader range of actions than ""handled"" or ""managed"".
3. The rest of the sentence structure is similar in both translations, with the focus on asking about the ship's management during the accident.

Overall, the machine translation captures the essence of the source text but with a few nuances that might make it slightly less accurate than the reference translation.

1. The source text refers to ""tantsustiili"" (dance styles), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""complex tankers"" or ""tankers"" (which is unrelated to dance styles). This is a significant difference.
2. The word ""populaarseks"" (popular) is translated correctly in both, but the machine translation adds ""to have"" which is not present in the reference translation.
3. ""Näiteks"" (for example) is translated as ""such as"" in both, but the machine translation omits the word ""and"" after ""such as"" in the list, which is present in the reference translation.

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
- Source: ""Hiljem, kui Nagy arreteeriti Jugoslaavia saatkonnas, tema arreteerimist ei kinnitatud.""
- Machine translation: ""Later than Nagy was arrested in the Yugoslav Embassy, his arrest was not confirmed.""
- Reference translation: ""Later , when Nagy was arrested at the Yugoslav embassy , his arrest was not confirmed.""

The source sentence starts with ""Hiljem"" (Later), which is translated as ""Later than"" in the machine translation. The reference translation uses ""Later"" as well, but it's more natural and concise. The machine translation adds ""than"" which is not necessary.

Step 2: Check verb tense and placement
- Source: ""Nagy arreteeriti"" (Nagy was arrested)
- Machine translation: ""Nagy was arrested""
- Reference translation: ""Nagy was arrested""

Both the machine and reference translations capture the past tense correctly, but the reference translation omits the unnecessary ""at the"" before ""Yugoslav embassy,"" which is consistent with the source.

Step 3: Analyze the phrase ""tema arreteerimist ei kinnitatud""
- Source: ""tema arreteerimist"" (his arrest)
- Machine translation: ""his arrest""
- Reference translation: ""his arrest""

Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation omits the word ""was"" before ""not confirmed,"" which is more natural in this context.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a few minor ways. It adds ""than"" unnecessarily, which is not present in the source or reference, and it includes ""was"" before ""not confirmed"" in the second part of the sentence, which is more natural in the reference. The overall meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is more concise and natural-sounding.

- Reference translation: ""In 1917, the ad hoc investigation committee concluded that the authority of Griffin as a planning director had been undermined.""

Difference: The machine translation omits the past participle ""õõnestatud"" (undermined) in the second part of the sentence, which is present in the reference translation. This changes the meaning slightly, as the reference indicates that the undermining had already taken place.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of terminology (using ""set-up"" instead of ""ad hoc"") and the tense of the verb ""undermined"" (omitting the past participle in the reference). The reference translation provides a more accurate and nuanced representation of the original Estonian text.

1. **Source**: Aadel pidi kogunema Varssavi lähedal Wolas, et kuninga valimistel hääletada.
   - The source text is about the nobility needing to gather in Wolas, near Warsaw, for the purpose of voting in the king's election.

2. **Machine translation**: In time it was due to meet in Wolas near Warsaw in order to vote with art in elections.
   - The machine translation has a few issues:
   - ""In time"" is not a suitable translation for ""Aadel pidi kogunema"" (The nobility was due to meet).
   - ""vote with art"" is a literal and incorrect interpretation of ""hääletada"" (to vote), suggesting a creative or artistic voting, which is not the intended meaning.
   - ""in elections"" is translated as ""in elections"" but should be ""in the election"" to match the context.

3. **Reference translation**: The nobility was due to meet in Wola near Warsaw in order to vote in the election of the king.
   - The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text:
   - ""The nobility"" corresponds to ""Aadel"".
   - ""was due to meet"" is translated as ""pidi kogunema"".
   - ""in Wola near Warsaw"" is preserved.
   - ""in order to vote"" is translated as ""et kuninga valimistel hääletada"".
   - ""the election of the king"" is a clear and correct interpretation of the context.

|im_end|>

Analysis: The machine translation has several discrepancies from the reference translation. It incorrectly translates ""Aadel pidi kogunema"" as ""In time it was due to meet,"" omits the context of the king's election, and introduces the concept of ""voting with art"" which is not present in the source. The reference translation, on the other hand, accurately captures the meaning and structure of the original Estonian text.

|im_start| Analyzing the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. **Source meaning**: The source text talks about Priit facing complex issues and having Saara as a support who can alleviate his worries about reality.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""langemas komplekside küüsi"" as ""falling into a complex tree,"" which is a literal and unrelated interpretation. It also incorrectly translates ""reaalsuse pisimuredega"" as ""with the tears of reality,"" suggesting a more dramatic and emotional context, which is not present in the source.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation captures the essence of the source by saying ""about to fall prey to his complexes"" and ""minor concerns of real life,"" which are more accurate and convey the intended meaning.

4. **Relevance and tone**: The machine translation loses the subtle tone of the source, which is about everyday concerns rather than a dramatic situation.

5. **Sentence structure**: The structure of the machine translation is awkward, with ""conquer him"" being an inappropriate choice for the context.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of meaning, context, and tone. The reference translation is a more accurate and faithful representation of the original Estonian text.

Step 1: Identify the subject and main verb
Source: Kalkun pani tähele (The turkey noticed)
Machine translation: Kalkun noted
Reference translation: The turkey noted

Difference: The machine translation omits the possessive pronoun ""talle"" (to him) and the verb ""pani tähele"" (to pay attention), which are important for clarity in the source text.

Step 2: Analyze the details about the food and time
Source: igal hommikul kell 9 süüa antud (given food at 9 a.m. every morning)
Machine translation: every morning at 9 a.m., and concluded that every day at 9 a.m.
Reference translation: given food for several weeks every morning at 9 a.m.

Difference: The machine translation does not specify that the food was given ""iga hommikul"" (every morning) or that it was ""igal päevil"" (every day) for several weeks. It only mentions the time, which is less detailed than the reference.

Step 3: Evaluate the conclusion
Source: ja ta tegi järelduse, et iga päev kell 9 (and he made a conclusion that every day at 9)
Machine translation: and concluded that every day at 9 a.m.
Reference translation: and concluded that every day at 9 a.m.

The conclusion is similar in both translations, but the machine translation omits the word ""päev"" (day) from the source, which might slightly affect the clarity.

Overall analysis:
The machine translation has differences in the subject, the description of the food being given, and the level of detail about the frequency. It does not capture the full meaning and context of the source text, particularly in terms of the duration of the food being given every morning. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian text, maintaining the subject, the time frame, and the conclusion.

|Machine translation: At the same time, current harvests have remained below the optimum amount and therefore it is considered necessary to grow volumes.|
|Reference translation: At the same time, current cutting volumes have remained below the optimal amount and therefore it is considered necessary to increase the volumes.|

|Analysis|
1. ""senised raiemahud"" (current harvests) in the source text is translated to ""current harvests"" in both the machine and reference translations, which is accurate.
2. ""jäänud alla optimaalse koguse"" (remained below the optimum amount) is translated to ""have remained below the optimum amount"" in both, which conveys the same meaning.
3. ""ning seega"" (and therefore) is correctly translated as ""and therefore"" in both, connecting the two ideas.
4. ""peetakse vajalikuks"" (it is considered necessary) is translated to ""it is considered necessary"" in both, maintaining the necessary action.
5. ""mahtude kasvatamist"" (volume growth) in the source is translated to ""to grow volumes"" in the machine translation and ""to increase the volumes"" in the reference translation. The meaning is similar, but the reference translation uses ""increase"" which is more precise, as it implies a specific action to make up for the lower-than-optimal amount.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the phrase ""to grow volumes"" could be improved to ""to increase the volumes"" to better align with the reference translation, which emphasizes the need for a specific action to address the situation. The overall meaning is conveyed, but the choice of words in the reference translation makes it slightly more precise.

|Machine translation: Most of the dead were men on police talks.|
|Reference translation: Most of the dead were men who had come to the police for a job interview.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference in context**: The machine translation uses ""on police talks"" which implies a more casual or informal conversation, while the reference translation specifies ""for a job interview,"" which is a more formal context. This suggests that the machine translation might be less accurate in capturing the intended meaning.

2. **Omission of key information**: The reference translation includes the crucial detail that the men were there for a ""job interview,"" which is not present in the machine translation. This could lead to a misunderstanding of the situation.

3. **Word choice**: The phrase ""töövestlusele tulnud"" in the source text is translated as ""on police talks"" in the machine translation, which might be a less precise translation. ""Töövestlusele"" typically refers to a job interview or a meeting to discuss work-related matters, not just a casual conversation.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of context, the inclusion of key details, and the choice of words, which affects the overall quality and accuracy of the translation.

|Machine translation: It turned out that the patent did not even exist because the Commissioner responsible had forgotten to pay for the patent.|
|Reference translation: It turned out that the patent was not even valid because the commissioner responsible had forgotten to pay for the patent.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text in Estonian states ""patent ei kehtinudki,"" which means ""the patent was not valid"" or ""it turned out that the patent was not valid."" The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the patent did not even exist,"" which is a stronger claim and implies that the patent was non-existent, not just invalid.
2. The phrase ""asjaga tegelenud volinik"" refers to the commissioner responsible for the matter. The machine translation uses ""the Commissioner responsible,"" which is a similar concept but with a slightly different phrasing.
3. The verb ""oli unustanud"" means ""had forgotten,"" which is accurately translated as ""had forgotten"" in the machine translation.

|Conclusion|
The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation lies in the interpretation of the patent's status. The machine translation incorrectly suggests that the patent was non-existent, while the reference translation correctly conveys that it was not valid. The other elements, such as the commissioner's responsibility and the act of forgetting, are accurately translated. Overall, the quality of the translation could be improved by maintaining the accuracy of the patent's validity instead of its existence.|im_end|

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Kontsert oli triumf, Mahleri biograaf Robert Carri hinnangul koguni ""kahtlusteta suurim edu tema eluajal"".
Machine translation: The Convention was considered by Mahler biograaf Robert Carri to be ""without doubt the greatest success of his lifetime.""

Step 2: Identify differences in translation.
- In the source text, ""Kontsert"" (concert) is translated as ""The Convention"" in the machine translation, which is a less accurate term.
- The phrase ""mahleri biograaf Robert Carri"" (Mahler's biographer Robert Carri) is translated as ""Mahler biograaf Robert Carri"" without the possessive ""Mahleri"" in the machine translation.
- The source text includes the phrase ""koguni"" (entirely, without a doubt) before ""kahtlusteta suurim edu tema eluajal"", which emphasizes the certainty of the statement. The machine translation omits this phrase, making the certainty less explicit.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: The concert was a triumph, according to Mahler 's biographer Robert Carr, even ""without a doubt the greatest success of his life"".

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The reference translation captures the meaning of the source text more accurately by translating ""Kontsert"" as ""The concert"" and including the possessive ""Mahler's"" in ""Mahler's biographer"".
- The reference translation also includes the phrase ""even"" to emphasize the certainty, which is missing in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, specificity, and emphasis. The reference translation better captures the meaning and tone of the source text, particularly in conveying the certainty of Mahler's biographer's opinion.

1. **Subject-verb agreement**: In the reference translation, ""on whom"" is used to indicate the indirect object of the verb ""found,"" which is correct for passive voice. The machine translation uses ""from whom,"" which is also correct but less idiomatic in this context, as it suggests a source rather than the recipients of the action.

2. **Preposition**: The reference translation uses ""in"" to indicate the location of the arrest, which is accurate. The machine translation also uses ""in,"" but the placement of the preposition is slightly different, which doesn't change the meaning but could be more natural.

3. **Passive voice**: The reference translation maintains the passive voice, which is appropriate for this context, as it emphasizes the discovery of the explosives rather than the action of the arrestees. The machine translation also uses passive voice but with a slightly different structure.

4. **Omission of comma**: The reference translation includes a comma after ""Lebanon"" to separate the two clauses, which improves readability. The machine translation omits this comma, but the meaning is still clear.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate, with only minor differences in phrasing and punctuation.

Source: Samuti läksid riigile palju maksma vaenlastele kehtestatud majanduslikud blokaadid.
Machine translation: The economic blockade imposed on the enemies also cost the country a great deal.

Step 2: Identify key phrases and words in the source text.
- ""Samuti läksid"" (also went)
- ""riigile"" (to the country)
- ""palju maksma vaenlastele"" (to many tax-paying enemies)
- ""kehtestatud"" (imposed)

Step 3: Compare these phrases with the machine translation.
- ""The economic blockade imposed on the enemies"" (matches ""kehtestatud majanduslikud blokaadid"" and ""vaenlastele"")
- ""also cost the country a great deal"" (matches ""läksid riigile palju"" and ""cost"")

Step 4: Analyze differences.
- The phrase ""maksma vaenlastele"" (tax-paying enemies) is not directly translated in the machine translation, but it can be inferred from the context that ""enemies"" refers to those who would be affected by the blockades and might be expected to pay taxes. The reference translation omits this detail, but it's not a significant error.

- The word order in the source text is ""Samuti läksid riigile"" (Also, it went to the country), which is translated as ""The economic blockade also cost the country"" in the machine translation. The meaning is preserved, but the word order is changed.

Conclusion: The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but it omits the detail about the enemies being tax-paying and changes the word order slightly. The overall meaning is preserved, but there is a minor loss of nuance in the translation. The quality is good but not perfect, as it could be improved by including the detail about tax-paying enemies and maintaining the original word order.

The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly consistent in terms of content and structure. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Sentence structure**: Both translations maintain the same sentence structure, starting with ""On"" (meaning ""on"" in English) to indicate the date, followed by the conversion rate and the currency.

2. **Translation of ""võrdus""**: In Estonian, ""võrdus"" means ""equivalent to"" or ""amounted to"" in this context. The machine translation uses ""equivalent to"" which is accurate.

3. **Numbers and currency**: The numbers and the currency codes are identical in both translations, which is correct.

4. **Punctuation**: The machine translation omits the commas after ""7 April 2013"" and ""17 December 2015"". In English, these are not necessary, but in the reference translation, they are used to separate the date and the conversion rate, which is a common practice in Estonian. However, this difference is minor and does not affect the overall meaning.

5. **Tenses**: Both translations use the past tense correctly, with ""equalled"" in the past tense form.

The main difference is the use of commas in the reference translation, which is a stylistic choice that reflects the original Estonian structure. Overall, the machine translation is of high quality and conveys the same information as the reference translation, with only a minor punctuation difference.

1. **""tunnistamist"" vs ""the recognition"":** The source text uses ""tunnistamist,"" which refers to the act of recognizing or acknowledging something, while the machine translation translates it as ""the recognition,"" which is a more general term. The reference translation captures this specific meaning.

2. **""me oleme kellelegi liiga teinud"" vs ""we have done someone too much"":** The source text implies that we have caused harm to someone, whereas the machine translation overstates the extent by using ""too much."" The reference translation, ""we have hurt someone,"" is a more accurate and nuanced translation.

3. **""näitab kõige paremini heastamine"" vs ""the best demonstration of redress"":** The source text uses ""heastamine"" (reparation or compensation), which is a more specific term than ""redress"" (making amends or addressing a wrong). The reference translation captures this by using ""redress"" but adds the context of ""best demonstration.""

4. **""see peakski tõsidust näitama"" vs ""that should be the seriousness of the matter"":** The source text suggests that the recognition of harm should be an indicator of the seriousness, but the machine translation adds the word ""should"" and changes the structure, making it sound more assertive. The reference translation, ""that should be the indication of seriousness,"" is a clearer and more accurate representation of the original meaning.

In summary, the machine translation has some differences in nuance and specificity compared to the reference translation, particularly in the areas of recognizing harm, the type of redress, and the emphasis on seriousness. The reference translation better captures the original Estonian text's meaning.

|im_start| Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Ta ajendab meid nägema maailma teise inimese vaatekohast.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: He is driving us to see the view of another man in the world.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: He is driving us to see the world from another man 's viewpoint.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the machine translation, ""nägema maailma"" is translated as ""to see the view of another man in the world,"" which is a literal translation but loses the nuance of ""vaatekohast"" (viewpoint) in the source text.
- The reference translation captures the idea of ""another man's viewpoint"" more accurately, using the phrase ""from another man's viewpoint.""

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in that it does not convey the concept of ""viewpoint"" as directly, opting for a more literal translation of ""view of another man in the world."" The reference translation better captures the intended meaning by emphasizing the perspective aspect.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Pärast viis päeva kestnud vastasseisu kaitsejõudude ja politseiga andsid mässulised alla.
Machine translation: After five days of confrontation with the defence forces and the police, the rebels surrendered.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- The source text uses ""vastasseisu"" which means ""confrontation"" or ""encounter"" in Estonian, while the machine translation uses ""confrontation with the defence forces and the police"". The context suggests that ""vastasseisu"" is a general term for the encounter, which is correctly translated as ""confrontation"" in the reference translation.
- The source text uses ""andsid mässulised alla"" which means ""the rebels surrendered"", while the machine translation also translates this as ""the rebels surrendered"". The meaning is the same in both.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Both the machine translation and the reference translation have the same structure and convey the same meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation only in the choice of words for ""vastasseisu"", where the source uses a more general term ""vastasseisu"" that is translated as ""confrontation"" in both the reference and machine translations. The overall meaning is the same, and the machine translation is of good quality, with only a minor difference in nuance.

|Source:| Portugal asub lähistroopikas, tal on lähistroopiline vahemereline kliima sooja ja niiske talvega ning palava ja kuiva suvega.
|Machine translation:| Portugal is near the tropics, has an intimate-sea Mediterranean climate with warm and nickel winter and with palm and dry summer.
|Reference translation:| Portugal is located in the subtropics, it has a subtropic Mediterranean climate with warm and humid winters and hot and dry summers.

|Analysis:|
1. **Lähistroopikas vs. subtropics**: The source text uses ""lähistroopikas"" which refers to the region being close to the tropics, while the reference translation uses ""subtropics."" This is a difference in terminology, but both convey the same idea of being in a climate zone just outside the tropics.
2. **Vahemereline kliima** vs. Mediterranean climate**: The source text describes a ""vahemereline"" climate, which is not a standard term in English. The reference translation translates this as ""Mediterranean climate,"" which is a more accurate term for the climate type typically associated with Portugal.
3. **Sooja ja niiske talve** vs. warm and humid winters**: The source text mentions ""niiske"" (which is not a standard word in English), possibly referring to a cool or mild winter. The reference translation simplifies this to ""warm and humid,"" which is a more common way to describe such a climate.
4. **Palava ja kuiva suve** vs. hot and dry summers**: The source text uses ""palava"" (hot) and ""kuiva"" (dry) to describe the summer, which is accurately translated in the reference translation.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in terminology (lähistroopikas vs. subtropics) and some translation choices (vahemereline kliima, niiske talve), but overall, it captures the main aspects of the climate description. The main issue is the lack of a standard English term for ""vahemereline kliima"" and the translation of ""niiske"" as ""warm and humid."" The reference translation is clearer and more commonly used in English.|

1. ""iseväärtus"" in the source text refers to ""inherent value"" in the reference translation. The machine translation uses ""self-value,"" which is not the exact equivalent in English. ""Ise"" means ""self"" or ""inner,"" while ""väärtus"" means ""value."" The reference translation captures the idea of the value being inherent or built-in, which is more accurate.

|im_start| Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the choice of the term ""self-value"" instead of ""inherent value."" The reference translation better conveys the idea that the value of love is a characteristic or attribute that comes naturally to it, whereas ""self-value"" might imply a more personal or subjective aspect. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation could be improved by using ""inherent value"" instead.

|Machine translation: The ink straight into the White House, then it was reported in the end that a couple of party driers had, as had been resonated, said 'anti-state talk', but there is not actually any anti-state talk.|
|Reference translation: Lint straight into the White House, then it was reported in the end that a couple of party veterans had been upset about the 'anti-state talk', which actually it was not.|

1. **""Lint kohe Valgesse Majja""** - Both translations capture this phrase, but the machine translation uses ""The ink straight into the White House"" which is a literal translation of ""lint"" (ink) and omits the context, while the reference translation keeps the metaphorical meaning and says ""Lint straight into the White House"".

2. **""sealt siis teatati lõpuks""** - The machine translation has ""then it was reported in the end"", which is a close but slightly awkward phrasing. The reference translation is ""then it was reported in the end"" as well, but with a more natural flow.

3. **""et paar parteiveterani oli nagu pahameelt avaldanud""** - The machine translation uses ""a couple of party driers had, as had been resonated, said"", which is incorrect. ""Pahameelt avaldanud"" means ""announced with ill will"" or ""expressed in a negative manner"". The reference translation captures this by saying ""had been upset about"", which conveys the same negative sentiment.

4. **""et riigivastane jutt""** - The machine translation translates this as ""the 'anti-state talk'"", which is a direct translation but loses the context. The reference translation keeps the original phrase, ""the 'anti-state talk'"", but adds the clarification ""which actually it was not"" to emphasize that there was no actual anti-state talk.

5. **""aga tegelikult ei ole""** - The machine translation has ""but there is not actually any anti-state talk"", which is a direct translation but omits the emphasis on the fact that it was not true. The reference translation keeps the emphasis with ""which actually it was not"".

In summary, the machine translation has some issues with maintaining the original meaning, context, and emphasis, while the reference translation is more accurate and natural in English.

|im_start| Analyzing the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. **Source**: Säärane saamise süüvimine endasse (Specific culpability of ending up)
   - Machine translation: the culpability of ending up as such
   - Reference translation: self-contemplation of becoming

   The machine translation seems to have a direct translation of ""säärane saamise süüvimine"" as ""culpability of ending up as such,"" which is not an exact match for the reference's ""self-contemplation of becoming."" The source is referring to a more introspective aspect of ending up in a particular state, while the machine translation might imply a more general sense of responsibility.

2. **Structure**: ""nt elu puhul"" (for example, in the case of life)
   - Machine translation: in life
   - Reference translation: in the case of life

   The machine translation omits the ""nt"" (nt stands for ""ntegi"" in Estonian, which means ""for example"" or ""in this case"") and the structure ""puhul"" (meaning ""case"" or ""context""), making the phrase less clear than the reference translation.

3. **Overall meaning**: The machine translation might lose some nuance and context, focusing more on the action of ending up rather than the introspective aspect of the process.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the specific meaning and nuance, particularly in the description of the introspective aspect and the inclusion of the ""for example"" and context. The reference translation better captures the original Estonian sentence's intention.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Antud teos lasti välja ka NSV Liidu ajal""
- Machine translation: ""This act was also thrown out during the NSV""
- Difference: The machine translation uses ""thrown out"" (lõigatud välja), while the source text uses ""published"" (lõigatud). This change affects the meaning, as ""published"" implies the work was made available, while ""thrown out"" suggests rejection.

Step 2: Compare the rest of the source text.
- Source: ""tollased kriitikud ja tsensorid ei leidnud, et teose sisu võiks olla moraalinormide vastane.""
- Machine translation: ""the critics and censors at that time did not find that the content of the work could be anti-moral.""
- Difference: The machine translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text, with the exception of ""tollased"" (literally ""toll"" or ""tax"" in Estonian, but here it likely refers to ""official"" or ""state"" critics and censors). The rest of the sentence is translated correctly.

Step 3: Compare the reference translation.
- Reference translation: ""This work was also published during the USSR period, and the critics and censors at that time did not find that the content of the work could be anti-moral.""
- Differences: The reference translation uses ""published"" (lõigatud) like the source text, and it adds ""period"" after ""USSR"" to provide context. The rest of the sentence is identical to the machine translation.

Conclusion:
The machine translation has a significant difference in the choice of verb (""thrown out"" vs. ""published""), which changes the meaning. The rest of the sentence is mostly accurate, but the reference translation provides a clearer context by specifying ""period."" Overall, the machine translation could be improved by using ""published"" instead of ""thrown out"" to align with the source text and the reference translation.

Machine translation: ""In The Netherlands, the National Assembly of the International Criminal Court was held in The Hague, where Estonia was represented by Foreign Minister Urmas Paet.""

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The source text uses ""Hollandis"" (in Dutch) which refers to ""in the Netherlands"" in English, while the machine translation correctly uses ""In The Netherlands.""
- The source text mentions ""Rahvusvahelise Kriminaalkohtu liikmesriikide assamblee"" which is a direct translation of ""assembly of the Member States of the International Criminal Court,"" but the machine translation simplifies it to ""National Assembly of the International Criminal Court.""
- The rest of the sentence structure is similar, with the mention of ""Eestit esindas välisminister Urmas Paet"" being the same in both.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the way it describes the assembly as ""National Assembly"" instead of ""Assembly of the Member States,"" which is a less precise term.

|Reference translation: A universal plan, order and harmony of the universe are just as typical of the Heraclitan world as eternal mobility.|

|Analysis|
1. **Universal plan**: In the source text, ""Universumi üldine plaan"" refers to ""the universal plan"" in a more direct and specific way, while the machine translation omits the word ""universe"" and uses ""The universal plan"" which is slightly less precise.
2. **Order and harmony**: Both the source and the machine translation use ""order and harmony"" as a direct translation, but the reference translation adds ""of the universe"" after ""order and harmony"" to clarify the context.
3. **Herakleitose maailmale**: The source text uses ""Herakleitose maailmale"" (Herakleitos' world), while the machine translation omits the possessive form and uses ""the Herakleitos world."" The reference translation also omits the possessive but adds ""the Heraclitan"" for clarity.
4. **Igavene liikuvus**: The source text uses ""igavene liikuvus"" (eternal mobility), which is a direct translation. The machine translation also uses ""eternal mobility"" but omits the possessive ""of"" before ""eternal."" The reference translation keeps ""eternal mobility"" but adds ""of the"" for a more complete sentence.

Machine translation: On 13 February 2006, the US State Department commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution.

Step 2: Identify differences in structure and word order.
- The source text uses ""mälestas"" (commemorated) in the past tense, while the machine translation uses ""commemorated"" in the present tense. This is a minor difference in tense, but the meaning is preserved.
- The source text includes the date ""13. veebruaril 2006"" (13th February 2006) before the event, while the machine translation omits it. This is a significant difference that affects the clarity of the context.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: On 13 February 2006, the US State Department commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution.

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The reference translation has the same structure as the source text, with the date and event in the correct order.
- The reference translation also uses the past tense for ""commemorated"" as in the source text.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:
1. It omits the date ""13. veebruaril 2006"" from the sentence, which is crucial for context.
2. It uses the present tense ""commemorated"" instead of the past tense ""mälestas"" in the source text.

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
- Source: Sellepärast jäid need paljasteks faktideks, mis ei olnud seotud ja mida ei saanud siduda elektriuurimise käimasoleva progressiga.
- Machine translation: They therefore remained mere facts that were unrelated and could not be linked to the ongoing progress of the electricity research.
- Reference translation: Therefore, these remained mere facts that were unrelated and could not be linked to the ongoing progress of electricity research.

The source sentence starts with ""Sellepärast"" (Therefore), which is translated as ""They therefore"" in the machine translation. The reference translation also starts with ""Therefore,"" which is consistent. However, the source sentence uses ""need"" (these) as the subject, while the machine translation uses ""They"" and the reference translation uses ""these."" The subject is correctly translated, but the word order is slightly different.

Step 2: Compare the word choice and grammar
- ""paljasteks faktideks"" (as exposed facts) is translated as ""mere facts"" in both machine and reference translations, which is a suitable equivalent.
- ""mida ei olnud seotud"" (which were unrelated) is translated as ""that were unrelated"" in both, maintaining the meaning.
- ""ja mida ei saanud siduda"" (and which could not be linked) is translated as ""and could not be linked"" in both, again preserving the meaning.

Step 3: Compare the context and meaning
- The source sentence discusses facts that were unrelated to the ongoing progress of electricity research, and the machine and reference translations convey this same meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the subject word order (using ""They"" instead of ""need""). The overall meaning and context are preserved, and the translation is of high quality. The differences are minor and do not significantly affect the comprehensibility of the sentence.

Here, the machine translation uses ""as"" to translate ""kui"" (as), which is correct. However, it translates ""kuju"" (image) as ""creature"" instead of ""image."" The reference translation is more precise, using ""image"" to convey the intended meaning.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it omits the word ""nõnda"" and translates ""kuju"" as ""creature"" instead of ""image."" The reference translation captures the nuance of the source text better and provides a more accurate translation in terms of the specific word choice and meaning.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Kohe saavad sellest külaskäigust teada ka Georg ja Are.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Mr Georg and Mr Georg will also be able to report this visit shortly.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Georg and Are are soon informed about this visit.

Step 4: Compare the subject and verb in the source and machine translation
Source: ""saavad"" (receive) and ""teada"" (inform)
Machine translation: ""will also be able to report"" (future tense, passive voice)

Step 5: Compare the names and form in the machine translation
Machine translation: ""Mr Georg and Mr Georg"" (formal, includes titles)
Reference translation: ""Georg and Are"" (informal, no titles)

Step 6: Compare the structure and meaning
Machine translation: The machine translation adds unnecessary titles and changes the structure to a future tense passive voice, which is not present in the source text.

Step 7: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation incorrectly adds titles ""Mr"" to the names, which is not common in Estonian.
- It changes the verb ""saavad"" (receive information) to a future tense passive ""will be able to report,"" which is not accurate in conveying the meaning of the source.
- The machine translation uses ""shortly"" which is not present in the source, making the timing less precise.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of name formality, verb tense, and the addition of unnecessary details. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the original Estonian text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

|im_start|>

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: 813. aastal piiras bulgaarlaste sõjavägi, kelle juhiks oli kuningas Krum, edutult Konstantinoopolit.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: In 813, the Bulgarian army, led by King Krum, was unsuccessfully restricted by Konstantinople.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In 813 , the Bulgarian army , led by King Krum , was unsuccessfully besieging Constantinople .

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""restricted"" which does not convey the same meaning as the action described in the source text, which is ""piiras"" (surrounded or besieging).
- The reference translation uses ""besieging"", which is a more accurate term to describe the action of the Bulgarian army towards Konstantinople.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The verb ""restricted"" in the machine translation is incorrect; it should be replaced with ""besieging"" to match the context.
- The machine translation omits the comma after ""813"", which is present in the source text and the reference translation, but does not significantly affect the meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the verb choice (using ""restricted"" instead of ""besieging"") and the punctuation. The overall meaning is not entirely accurate, as the action of the Bulgarian army is not correctly conveyed as an unsuccessful siege.

|Reference translation: The rough Piacenza battle on 16 June 1746 was a difficult struggle, and Maillebois was about to win he was ordered to leave by the infant.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""Karm Piacenza lahing"" (Karm Piacenza battle), while the machine translation incorrectly capitalizes ""Karm"" and omits the possessive ""lahing"" (battle), making it ""Karm Piacenza's battle.""
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""peaaegu võitu võtmas"" (was about to win) as ""it was almost about to pass,"" which does not convey the same meaning of being close to victory.
3. The source mentions ""infanti käsk"" (order from the infant), which refers to a specific command given by a young ruler or prince. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the infection was ordered to leave,"" which is unrelated to the context of a battle command.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Seda tõestasid fossiilide lähedal leitud teokarbid.
Machine translation: The images found close to fossils proved this.

Difference: The source text refers to ""teokarbid,"" which likely means ""traces"" or ""imprints"" in Estonian, while the machine translation translates it as ""images."" This is a significant difference, as the context suggests that the evidence is not images but physical traces or impressions.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: The images found close to fossils proved this.
Reference translation: This was proven by the snail shells found close to the fossils.

Difference: The reference translation specifies that the evidence is ""snail shells,"" which is a more accurate and detailed translation of ""teokarbid"" in this context. The machine translation omits this detail, making the translation less precise.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it incorrectly translates ""teokarbid"" as ""images"" instead of ""snail shells."" This results in a less accurate representation of the source text, particularly in terms of the specific evidence provided. The reference translation provides a clearer and more faithful translation of the original Estonian sentence.

|Analysis|
1. **""Aukartus""** (prize) vs. **""Aukartus""** (respect): The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Aukartus"" as ""prize,"" while the reference translation correctly uses ""respect.""
2. **""liini kaitsjate ees""** (in the face of the line's defenders) vs. **""liini kaitsjate""** (defenders of the line): The source text includes the preposition ""ees,"" which is not translated in the machine translation, making it sound incomplete.

4. **""et ei juletud teha""** (that it was not done) vs. **""that it did not even talk about""**: The machine translation incorrectly implies a discussion about intelligence patrols, while the reference translation conveys the idea that the respect was so great that proper reconnaissance was not carried out.

|machine_translation| It is only by ignoring the imperatives of moral law that we cannot choose freely.|
|reference_translation| It is only the ignoring of the imperatives of moral law that we cannot choose freely.|

Analysis:

1. **Subject and verb**: Both the machine and reference translations correctly identify the subject ""me"" (we) and the verb ""ei saa"" (cannot choose). The verb tense is also consistent.

2. **Prepositional phrase**: The source text has ""käskude imperatiivide ignoreerimist"" (ignoring the imperatives of moral law). The machine translation uses ""by ignoring the imperatives of moral law"" which is a similar structure, but it adds ""by"" which is not necessary in this context.

3. **Article**: The source text uses ""ainult"" (only) before the main clause, which is translated as ""It is only"" in the machine translation. The reference translation omits ""the"" before ""ignoring"" to maintain the parallelism with the source.

4. **Punctuation**: The source text ends with a period, but the machine translation omits it. The reference translation includes the period.

5. **Sentence structure**: The main difference lies in the placement of ""the"" and the structure of the phrase ""by ignoring."" The machine translation adds ""by"" which is not present in the source or reference, and the reference omits ""the"" to maintain a more natural flow in English.

Conclusion: The machine translation is slightly different from the reference translation due to the unnecessary addition of ""by"" and the absence of ""the"" in the reference. The core meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian structure and phrasing.

|im_start| Analyzing the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. **Source text**: ""Allan ja Alma muretsevad Mare pärast, kuid saavad üllatuse osalisteks.""
   - Machine translation: ""I will begin and Alma worry about Mare, but I will be surprised.""
   - Reference translation: ""Allan and Alma are worried about Mare, but get a surprise.""

2. **Subject and verb**: The source text refers to ""Allan ja Alma"" (Allan and Alma) as the subjects, while the machine translation incorrectly assumes a first-person perspective (""I will begin""). The reference translation correctly uses the plural form ""are worried"" for the subjects.

3. **Action**: The source text uses ""muretsevad"" (worry) and ""saavad üllatuse osalisteks"" (get a surprise), which implies a shared experience. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""saavad üllatuse osalisteks"" as ""I will be surprised,"" suggesting a single person's surprise, whereas the reference translation captures the shared surprise with ""get a surprise.""

4. **Tense**: The source text uses the present tense, while the machine translation uses a future tense (""will begin""). The reference translation uses the present tense, which is more appropriate for the context.

5. **Word order**: The source text maintains a natural word order for Estonian, while the machine translation rearranges the phrases, making it less natural in English.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of subject-verb agreement, shared experience, tense, and word order, leading to a less accurate and natural English translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the main subject and action
- Source: Euroopa Liit otsustas (The European Union decided)
- Machine translation: The European Union decided
- Reference translation: The European Union decided

The main subject and action are the same in all three translations.

Step 2: Compare the object and context
- Source: suure eelarvepuudujäägi tõttu (due to a severe deficit)
- Machine translation: due to a severe deficit
- Reference translation: due to a severe budget deficit

The source mentions ""eelarvepuudujäägi"" which refers to a budget deficit. The machine translation and reference translation both convey this, but the reference adds the word ""budget"" for clarity.

Step 3: Compare the specific financial details
- Source: külmutada (to freeze)
- Machine translation: freeze
- Reference translation: freeze

Both translations use the verb ""freeze"" to describe the action taken with the financial resources.

- Source: määratud rahalised vahendid (allocated financial resources)
- Machine translation: financial resources
- Reference translation: financial allocations

The source uses ""vahendid"" which can be translated as ""resources"" or ""allocations."" The machine translation omits the word ""allocations,"" while the reference includes it for a more precise translation.

Step 4: Compare the total amount
- Source: kogusummas 495 miljonit eurot (total amount of 495 million euros)
- Machine translation: with a total budget of EUR 495 million
- Reference translation: in a total amount of EUR 495 million

Both the machine translation and reference translation convey the same information, but the reference adds the word ""amount"" for better clarity.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by including the word ""allocations"" to better match the source text. The reference translation provides a clearer and more precise translation, especially with the addition of ""budget"" and ""amount."" Overall, the main ideas are consistent, but the reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian text.

|Reference translation: The Committee on Culture of the XII Riigikogu appointed Paavi Nõgene, Agu Uudelepp and Mart Luikas as the new members of the Estonian Broadcasting Council.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject and Object**: The source mentions ""XII Riigikogu kultuurikomisjon"" (Committee on Culture of the XII Riigikogu) as the subject, while the machine translation incorrectly refers to it as ""The Committee on Culture of the Estonian National Broadcasting Council"". The reference translation correctly identifies the subject.
2. **Action**: The source uses ""nimetas"" (appointed), which is the past tense of the verb ""to appoint."" The machine translation uses ""was appointed,"" which is also past tense but in a passive voice, which is not necessary here. The reference translation uses the active voice ""appointed,"" which is more natural.
3. **New members**: The source lists ""Paavo Nõgese, Agu Uudelepa ja Mart Luige"" as the new members. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Pope vo Nygese"" and ""Age Nodelepa"" (likely a typo, as ""Age"" does not match the source).

|Reference translation: The decision should make it difficult to establish the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would increase the European Union 's dependence on gas supplied by Russia.|

Analysis:
1. **""gaasitrassi"" vs ""gas route"":** The source text uses ""gaasitrassi,"" which is a compound word in Estonian referring to the gas pipeline route. The machine translation translates it as ""gas route,"" which is a more general term but still conveys the intended meaning. The reference translation uses ""gas pipeline,"" which is a more direct and accurate term for the specific infrastructure.
2. **""rajamist"" vs ""establishment"":** The source text uses the verb ""rajamist"" (establishment), which is the genitive form of ""raada"" (to establish). The machine translation uses ""establishment,"" which is a suitable equivalent. The reference translation also uses ""establish,"" which is a more common English term for this context.
3. **""Euroopa Liidu sõltuvust"" vs ""the European Union's dependence"":** Both the machine and reference translations correctly convey the idea of increasing the European Union's dependence. The source text uses the genitive form ""sõltuvust"" (dependence), while the translations use the possessive form ""the European Union's dependence.""
4. **""Venemaa tarnitavast maagaasist"" vs ""gas supplied by Russia"":** The source text specifies that the gas is supplied by Russia (""Venemaa tarnitavast maagaasist""). The machine translation captures this by saying ""gas supplied by Russia,"" while the reference translation also uses this phrase.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate, with some minor differences in wording and structure. The main difference is the use of ""gas route"" instead of ""gaasitrassi,"" which is a more general term but still conveys the intended meaning.

5. **Contextual understanding**: The machine translation lacks the understanding of the historical figure (Karl Popper) and the specific topic of ambivalence towards progress through revolutions, which is crucial for an accurate translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation is of poor quality due to its incorrect identification of the subject and failure to convey the intended meaning from the source text. The reference translation is the more accurate and faithful representation of the original Estonian text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
|Source: Üldjuhul aga ei tulene sellest, et kedagi armastatakse tema väärtuslike omaduste pärast, et armastatakse tema omadusi, mitte teda ennast.|
|Machine translation: In general, however, it is not because anyone is loved for their valuable qualities that they love their qualities, not for their own qualities.|
|Reference translation: In general, however, the fact that someone is loved for their valuable qualities does not mean that it is their qualities that are loved, not the person.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text starts with ""Üldjuhul aga"" which means ""In general, however"" in English. Both the machine and reference translations capture this correctly.
2. The source mentions ""ei tulene sellest"" which means ""it is not because"" or ""does not derive from this"". The machine translation has ""it is not because anyone is loved"", which is close but omits the ""for"" and implies a broader subject (anyone) than the original.
3. ""kedagi armastatakse tema väärtuslike omaduste pärast"" translates to ""anyone is loved for their valuable qualities"". The machine translation captures this as ""they love their qualities"", which is a simplification, losing the original focus on the qualities being the reason for love.
4. ""et armastatakse tema omadusi, mitte teda ennast"" means ""not for their own qualities, not for themselves"". The machine translation has ""not for their own qualities"", which is accurate, but omits ""not for themselves"" which is important to convey the distinction.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is generally accurate but loses some nuance and specificity in the original text. It simplifies the cause-effect relationship and omits the emphasis on the distinction between loving qualities and the person. The reference translation better captures the nuances and structure of the source, making it a higher-quality translation.

The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly in line with each other, with only a minor difference in formatting. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Content**: Both translations convey the same information about the economic growth rates for the years 1999, 2000, and 2001.
2. **Numbers**: The percentages (0.8%, 2.7%, and 1.3%) are identical in both translations.
3. **Phrasing**: The main difference lies in the use of a comma ("","") after ""1999"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference translation. This is a minor punctuation difference and does not affect the meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is of high quality and captures the essence of the source text accurately, with only a minor punctuation inconsistency. The meaning and context are preserved well.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: ""28. juuli hommikul oli Grenaderimäe idakaevikus kaitsel 30 rünnakule asunud 450 mehest 47. rügemendi I pataljonist.""
Machine translation: ""On the morning of 28 July, the thirty attacks on the protection of the Grenaderfist in the eastern camera had been carried out by 450 men from 47 rhysiements I.""

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The source mentions ""kaitsel"" (defending), while the machine translation uses ""protection of the Grenaderfist.""
- The source specifies ""30 rünnakule"" (30 attacks), while the machine translation omits this detail.
- The source uses ""47. rügemendi I pataljonist"" (1st battalion of the 47th regiment), while the machine translation has ""47 rhysiements I,"" which is a likely typo or incorrect term.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: ""On the morning of 28 July, of the 450 men of the 1st battalion of the 47th regiment who had gone on the attack, only 30 were still defending the eastern trench of the Grenadier Hill.""

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation correctly captures the defending aspect (""only 30 were still defending"").
- It includes the detail of ""30 rünnakule"" (30 attacks) and specifies the context of the 1st battalion of the 47th regiment.
- The reference translation uses ""eastern trench"" instead of ""eastern camera,"" which is a more accurate description of the location.

Conclusion:
The machine translation has several differences from the reference translation, including the incorrect translation of ""kaitsel"" to ""protection of the Grenaderfist,"" the omission of the detail about 30 attacks, and the use of an incorrect term ""rhysiements"" instead of ""battalion."" The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Nagu Platon ""Phaidrose"" lõpus märgib, ei ole sõnades endis tarkust.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: As Platon's 'Phaidros' states at the end, words do not have wisdom in themselves.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: As Plato states at the end of 'Phaidros', words do not have wisdom in themselves.

Step 4: Compare the differences
1. In the source text, ""Nagu Platon"" refers to ""As Plato"" in both translations, which is correct.
2. The machine translation has ""Platon's 'Phaidros'"" while the reference translation has ""at the end of 'Phaidros'"". The reference omits the possessive 's' and adds a comma after 'end', which is a stylistic difference but does not change the meaning.
3. The machine translation uses ""endis"" which is a direct translation of ""lõpus"" (end), while the reference uses ""at the end of"" which is a more idiomatic way to express the same idea in English.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in style. The main point about Plato's statement and the lack of inherent wisdom in words is preserved. The main issue is the lack of a comma in the machine translation, which slightly affects the sentence structure but does not alter the meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of good quality, with a few minor adjustments needed for better fluency and adherence to English grammar. The core message is accurately conveyed.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Ameerika Ühendriikides allkirjastas Connecticuti osariigi kuberner Dannel Malloy seaduse, millega kaotati osariigis surmanuhtlus.
Machine translation: In the United States, Governor Dannel Malloy of Connecticut State signed the law abolishing the death penalty in the State.

Step 2: Identify differences in structure and word choice.
- The source text starts with ""Ameerika Ühendriikides"" (in the United States), while the machine translation omits this phrase, making it less specific.
- The source uses ""allkirjastas"" (signed), which is the verb for signing a document, while the machine translation uses ""signed the law"", which is a more direct but less idiomatic translation.
- The source includes ""kaotati osariigis"" (abolished in the state), while the machine translation omits this part, which is crucial for understanding the context.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: In the United States, Governor Dannel Malloy of Connecticut State signed the law abolishing the death penalty in the State.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation is similar to the source text in structure and includes the necessary context about the death penalty being abolished in the state.
- The main difference is the absence of ""Ameerika Ühendriikides"" in the reference translation, which is a stylistic choice that omits the redundant information already implied by ""United States"".

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it omits the location ""Ameerika Ühendriikides"" and does not explicitly state that the death penalty was abolished in the state. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text, especially in terms of context.

|Reference translation: He omitted them from the final version, but he still believed that his theory could be reconciled with some versions of Newton's mechanical world model.|

|Analysis:|
1. ""Lõplikust versioonist jättis ta need kõrvale"" - Machine translation: ""In the final version, he deleted them"" - The reference translation uses ""omitted them from the final version"", which is a more accurate and concise way to convey the action of leaving something out. The machine translation uses ""deleted them"", which is correct but less idiomatic.
2. ""kuid uskus endiselt, et"" - Machine translation: ""but he still believed that"" - Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation uses ""still"" to emphasize the persistence of the belief, which is not present in the machine translation.
3. ""tema teooria on ühitatav"" - Machine translation: ""his theory could be reconciled"" - The machine translation captures the idea of compatibility or reconciliation, but the reference translation uses ""could be reconciled with"" to provide a clearer context of the relationship between the theory and Newton's model.
4. ""Newtoni mehaanilise maailmapildi"" - Machine translation: ""Newton mechanical world picture"" - The reference translation adds the possessive 's to ""Newton"" to make it ""Newton's"", which is more grammatically correct and emphasizes the connection to Newton.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate but loses some nuance and idiomatic expression compared to the reference translation. The main differences lie in the choice of words and the way the relationship between the theory and Newton's model is expressed.|im_end|

The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly in line with each other, with a few minor differences:

1. ""mõnest minimaalsest teo"" in the source text is translated to ""a minimum set of actions"" in the machine translation. The reference translation simplifies this to ""a minimum structure of action,"" which is a more concise and accurate representation of the original idea.

2. ""soovi või uskumuse struktuurist"" in the source text includes both ""wishes"" (soovi) and ""belief"" (uskumuse struktuur).

|Analysis|
1. **""Kui diviis oli ümber formeeritud""** (When the division was reformed) - Machine translation: ""when the method was reformed"" - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""diviis"" (division) as ""method"", which is a significant difference in context.
2. **""saadeti see""** (it was sent) - Machine translation: ""it was sent"" - This part is correctly translated, but the structure is slightly different in the reference translation, which might affect the flow.
3. **""Riesengebirge mäestiku jalamile""** (to the foot of the Riesengebirge Mountains) - Machine translation: ""Mesengevage Rountain"" - The machine translation mistranslates ""Riesengebirge"" as ""Mesengevage"" and omits ""jalamile"" (to the foot), which is a crucial part of the location.
4. **""Hirschberist 15 km kaugusele""** (15 km from Hirschberg) - Machine translation: ""15 km from the Schönau base"" - The machine translation incorrectly places the distance from Schönau instead of Hirschberg, which is the main point of reference.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the subject (division vs. method), the location (Riesengebirge Mountains vs. Mesengevage Rountain), and the reference point for the distance (Hirschberg vs. Schönau base).

Anastasius I paistis silma kui energeetiline reformide läbiviija ja valitseja.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Anastasius I stood out as the guardian of the energy reforms and the ruler.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Anastasius I was notable as an energetic reformer and ruler.

Step 4: Compare the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation

1. In the source text, ""paistis silma"" means ""stood out"" or ""was noticeable"" in the sense of making an impression, while the machine translation uses ""stood out"" which is a direct translation but might not convey the full sense of being noticeable or making an impact.

2. The source text uses ""kui energeetiline reformide läbiviija"" which means ""as the energegetic (energetic) reformer's process"" or ""as the guardian of energy reforms."" The machine translation simplifies this to ""the guardian of the energy reforms,"" losing the emphasis on the energy and the process of the reforms.

3. The source text includes ""ja valitseja"" which means ""and ruler,"" while the machine translation also includes this part. However, the reference translation omits ""and"" and rephrases it as ""and ruler,"" which is a stylistic choice that does not change the meaning.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation captures the main ideas but loses some nuance and emphasis on the energetic nature of the reforms and the process. The reference translation, while slightly different in structure, maintains the essence of the source text and conveys the same meaning. The machine translation could be improved by adding a phrase to emphasize the energy aspect and preserving the original structure to a greater extent.

|Translation| | Kant says that these two criteria will inevitably coincide, so that every a priori truth is a universal truth.| |

|im_end|>

1. **Translation of ""kaks kriteeriumi"":** The source uses ""kaks kriteeriumi"" (two criteria), which is accurately translated as ""these two criteria"" in both the machine and reference translations.
2. **Translation of ""langevad paratamatult kokku"":** Both translations have ""will inevitably coincide,"" which is a correct rendering of ""langevad paratumatult kokku"" (inevitably fall together).
3. **Translation of ""iga aprioorne tõde"":** The source uses ""iga aprioorne tõde"" (every a priori truth), which is translated as ""every priori truth"" in both. The only difference is the use of ""priori"" instead of ""aprioorne,"" which is a minor variation in English and does not affect the meaning.
4. **Translation of ""on üleüldine tõde"":** Both translations have ""is a universal truth,"" which is a faithful translation of ""on üleüldine tõde.""

**Conclusion:** The machine translation is very similar to the reference translation, with only a minor difference in the word choice for ""a priori."" The overall meaning and structure are preserved, and the translation is of high quality. The differences are minor and do not significantly affect the accuracy of the translation.

1. **Source**: Ratsionaalset toimijat ei tule mõista lihtsalt kolmandas isikus olendist, kelle käitumist tuleb seletada uskumuste ja soovidega.
   - **Reference translation**: A rational actor cannot simply be understood as a third-party being whose behaviour must be explained by beliefs and wishes.
   - **Machine translation**: A rational player cannot simply be understood by a third-party man whose behaviour must be explained by beliefs and wishes.

2. **Comparison**: The main difference lies in the choice of words ""toimijat"" (agent) and ""player"" in the machine translation. The source text uses ""toimijat"" which is more general and could refer to an agent of any kind, while ""player"" specifically implies a person involved in a game or competition. The reference translation uses ""actor"" which is a more neutral term that can encompass both.

3. **Translation of ""kolmandas isikus olendist""**: The source text uses ""kolmandas isikus olendist"" which means ""a being in the third person"", while the reference translation omits this phrase, using ""third-party being"" instead. This is a minor difference, as the meaning is still clear in the reference.

4. **Translation of ""kelle käitumist tuleb seletada""**: The source text uses ""kelle käitumist tuleb seletada"" (the behavior must be explained), while the machine translation has ""whose behavior must be explained"". The meaning is the same, but the structure is slightly different.

5. **Other**: The machine translation adds ""a third-party man"" which is not in the source text. This might be an attempt to clarify the subject, but it introduces a gendered element that is not present in the original.

In summary, the machine translation captures the essence of the source text but makes some changes in terms of specificity (player vs. actor) and gender (omitting ""kolmandas isikus olendist"" and adding ""a third-party man""). The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian, maintaining a neutral and general tone.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Toetust on leidnud arusaam, et iga haiguse ravi tuleb kiire transport vs ravi kohapeal vaidluses vaadata eraldi.
Machine translation: There is support for the idea that the treatment of each disease must be viewed separately from the debate on the ground by means of rapid transport treatment.

Step 2: Identify differences in structure and wording.
- The source text uses ""vaadata eraldi"" (view separately), while the machine translation uses ""from the debate on the ground"" and ""by means of rapid transport treatment.""
- The machine translation adds ""by means of"" and combines ""fast transport"" with ""treatment on site"" in a way that the source text does not.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: There is support for the idea that the treatment of each disease must be viewed separately in the debate of fast transport versus treatment on site.

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The reference translation captures the idea of viewing each disease's treatment separately more accurately, using ""in the debate of"" instead of specifying a method (like ""by means of"").
- It separates ""fast transport"" and ""treatment on site"" as two distinct elements, which is clearer than the machine translation's combined phrase.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its structure and the way it presents the concept of separating treatment based on the mode of transport. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text in terms of clarity and separation of ideas.

Step 1: Understand the source text
The source text in Estonian says, ""Darwinite sugupuu on koostatud kuni 1500. aastani,"" which translates to ""The Darwinian family tree has been created up to the year 1500.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation provided is, ""The Darwinian family has been produced up to 1500s,"" which is not an accurate translation of the source text. The key difference here is the use of ""produced"" instead of ""created"" and the lack of the term ""family tree.""

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation
The reference translation, ""The Darwinian family tree has been produced up to 1500s,"" is closer to the source text but still has a minor issue. The correct term should be ""created"" instead of ""produced"" to maintain the meaning of the original text.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in two ways:
1. It uses ""produced"" instead of ""created,"" which implies a manufacturing or production process, whereas the source text refers to the creation of a family tree, which is a concept.
2. It omits the term ""family tree,"" which is crucial for accurately conveying the meaning.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should be: ""The Darwinian family tree has been created up to 1500.""

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Portugali esiajalugu on osa kogu Pürenee poolsaare kui terviku varasest ajaloost.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Portugal's history of history is part of the early history of the Iberian Peninsula as a whole.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Portugal 's pre-history is part of the early history of the Iberian Peninsula as a whole.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation has ""Portugal's history of history,"" which is redundant and incorrect. The reference translation uses ""Portugal 's pre-history,"" which is a more accurate and concise term.
- The source text mentions ""esiajalugu"" (prehistory), but the machine translation omits this word, leading to a different meaning.
- The source text uses ""kui terviku varasest ajaloost"" (as part of the overall ancient history), while the machine translation omits the word ""varasest"" (ancient), which changes the context slightly.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of accuracy and context. The main differences are the redundant phrase ""history of history,"" the omission of ""prehistory,"" and the loss of the word ""ancient"" in the description of the history.

- Source: Armastaja, kes rõhutaks, et kõiki, sealhulgas oma armastatut, tuleb kohelda ebaisikuliselt ja kiretult, oleks eemaletõukav.
- Machine translation: A figure who would stress that everyone, including their loved ones, should be treated in an unpersonal and unentangled manner would be repellent.

Difference: The machine translation uses ""unentangled"" instead of ""kiretult"" (which means ""quickly"" or ""hastily"" in Estonian). This change affects the connotation of the sentence, as ""unentangled"" does not convey the same urgency or immediacy as ""kiretult.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: A figure who would stress that everyone, including their loved ones, should be treated in an unpersonal and unentangled manner would be repellent.
- Reference translation: A lover who would stress that everyone, including their loved one, should be treated in an unpersonal and impassionate manner, would be repulsive.

Difference: The machine translation omits the word ""impassionate"" (which is ""kiretult"" in Estonian), which is crucial to convey the emotional aspect of the sentence. The reference translation also specifies ""loved one"" instead of ""loved ones,"" which is a more accurate translation of ""oma armastatut.""

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:
1. It uses ""unentangled"" instead of ""kiretult,"" which changes the meaning and urgency of the sentence.
2. It omits the word ""impassionate"" and translates "" oma armastatut"" as ""their loved ones"" instead of ""loved one,"" which affects the clarity and emotional context of the sentence.

1. **Subject and verb**: The source text uses ""leidub"" (found) in the passive voice, while the machine translation uses ""is"" in the active voice. The reference translation also uses ""are"" in the active voice, but it's more consistent with the passive voice in the source.
2. **Adjective and noun**: The source text has ""väga häid muldi"" (very good soil), where ""muldi"" is the plural form of ""mud"" or ""soil"" in Estonian. The machine translation uses ""very good soil"" as a single phrase, which is a direct translation but omits the plural form. The reference translation correctly translates this to ""very good soils"" to match the plural in the source.
3. **Article**: The source text omits the definite article ""the"" before ""muldi"" (soil), while the machine translation and reference translation include it. In Estonian, definite articles are often dropped in certain contexts, so the reference translation is more accurate in this regard.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the use of active voice instead of passive, the plural form of ""muldi"" (soils), and the inclusion of the definite article. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian structure and meaning.

Source: ""42 kohast said bolševikud endale 15, seejuures Podolski linnale ette nähtud 4 kohast võtsid bolševikud 3 kohta.""
Machine translation: ""Out of 42, the Bolsheans themselves got 15, while 4 sites on the town of Podolski were filed by the Bolshevs 3.""

Step 2: Identify differences in sentence structure.

- The source text uses ""said bolševikud endale"" (got themselves) which is translated as ""the Bolsheans themselves got"" in the reference translation.
- The source text has ""seejuures"" (while) which is translated as ""while"" in the machine translation, but the placement of ""while"" is slightly different in the reference translation, where it is placed after ""out of 4 places intended for the city of Podolsk.""
- The source text uses ""nähtud"" (seen) which is not directly translated in the machine translation, but the reference translation implies it by saying ""4 places intended for the city of Podolsk.""

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences on meaning.

- The difference in placement of ""while"" slightly changes the emphasis in the sentence, but the overall meaning is preserved.
- The reference translation adds the detail of ""intended for the city of Podolsk"" which clarifies the context of the 4 sites.

Conclusion: The machine translation captures the main idea but loses some nuance and context by not specifying that the 4 sites were intended for Podolsk. The reference translation provides a clearer and more precise translation, especially with the additional information about the intended destination. The main difference lies in the additional details provided by the reference translation.

2. **Machine translation**: Five hundred and fifty flights were cancelled because of the strike.
   - The machine translation correctly states the number of flights (550) and mentions the reason (strike) but omits the agent (firma) and the passive construction, which is crucial for understanding who cancelled the flights.

3. **Reference translation**: Five hundred and fifty flights were cancelled by the company because of the strike.
   - The reference translation includes the agent (company) and uses the passive construction, which clearly indicates that the company is the one responsible for the cancellations.

**Analysis**: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in two aspects:
- It does not specify the agent (company) responsible for the cancellations, which is important for clarity.
- It uses an active voice (""were cancelled because of"") instead of a passive voice (""were cancelled by""), which is more appropriate in this context to emphasize the action taken by the company.

|Reference translation: Since then , gas exploration was accelerated , especially under Henry Cavendishi , Joseph Priestley and Carl Wilhelm Scheele .|

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""Pärast seda"" which means ""After that"" in Estonian. The machine translation correctly captures this as ""Since then"".
2. ""edenes gaaside uurimine"" refers to ""the progress of gas research"" or ""gas exploration"". The machine translation accurately translates this as ""gas exploration"".

|Reference translation: The Fascists mistrusted Hitler 's ideas of Pan-Germanism, which they considered to be a threat to Italian territories that had previously been part of the Austrian Empire.|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation has an error in the term ""banking ermanism,"" which should be ""Pan-Germanism"" as in the reference translation. This is a key difference, as Pan-Germanism refers to the political ideology that promotes the unification of German-speaking peoples, not banking.
2. The reference translation correctly uses ""Austrian Empire"" while the machine translation refers to ""Austrian Emperor."" The Empire is the more appropriate term here, as it refers to the historical political entity, not a single individual.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the correct terminology for ""Germanism"" (Pan-Germanism) and the historical context of the territories (Austrian Empire vs. Austrian Emperor).

1. **""võitis valimised""** (Machine: ""the only remaining businessman to stand as a candidate for the elections"") - The machine translation slightly differs by using ""to stand as a candidate"" instead of ""won the election."" The reference translation is more accurate in conveying that Ahmad Ma‘ītīq won the election.

2. **""ainsana kandideerima""** (Machine: ""the only remaining businessman"") - The machine translation omits the word ""kandideerima"" (to run for) and instead uses ""remaining businessman,"" which is less precise. The reference translation includes this detail.

3. **""Ahmad Ma‘ītīq""** (Both: ""Adarmad mad mad mad ītīq"" and ""Ahmad Ma’ītīq"") - The machine translation has a typographical error and misspells the name. The reference translation is correct.

4. **""kes vannutati""** (Machine: ""who was also imprisoned"") - The machine translation incorrectly assumes a negative connotation (imprisonment) based on the source text, which only states that he was appointed to a position. The reference translation correctly omits this information.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Water cannons and tear gas were used to ward off people.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the source text
- The source text mentions ""inimeste tagasitõrjumiseks"" which means ""for people's repulsion"" or ""to disperse people"" in English. The machine translation captures this as ""to ward off people,"" which is an accurate translation.

- Both the source and machine translation use ""veekahureid"" and ""pisargaasi"" to refer to water cannons and tear gas, respectively. These terms are directly translated and match.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation

- Numbers: kakskümmend seitse (twenty-seven) and viis (five)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""Twenty-seven people died and five were injured.""
- Reference translation: ""Twenty-seven people died and five were injured in the accident.""

Difference analysis:
1. The source text includes ""Õnnetuses"" (Accident), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation includes this context, making it clearer.
2. The machine translation omits the word ""in the"" before ""accident,"" which is important for providing context to the reader.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality
- The machine translation accurately conveys the numbers and the actions (died and injured), but it lacks the context provided by the word ""õnnetuses"" and the phrase ""in the accident.""
- The reference translation is more coherent and provides a clearer picture of the situation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of context and clarity. The reference translation is of higher quality as it includes the necessary context to understand the event.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: Hiinas Hongkongis tühjendas politsei demokraatlikke valimisi nõudvatest meeleavaldajatest Mong Koki piirkonna.
- Machine translation: In Hong Kong, China, the police empty the protesters calling for democratic elections in the Mong Koki region.

Step 2: Identify differences in structure and wording.
- The source text starts with ""Hiinas Hongkongis"" (In China, Hong Kong), while the machine translation combines it into ""In Hong Kong, China"".
- The source uses ""tühjendas"" (emptyed) and ""nõudvatest meeleavaldajatest"" (from protesters demanding), while the machine translation combines these into ""the protesters calling for"".
- The source specifies ""Mong Koki piirkonna"" (Mong Koki district), while the machine translation uses ""the Mong Koki region"".

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: In Hong Kong, China, police cleared the Mong Kok area of protesters calling for democratic elections.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation is more concise and clear, using ""cleared"" instead of ""empty the protesters"", which implies the removal of the protesters from the area.
- The reference omits ""nõudvatest"" (calling for) from the translation, which is not necessary in this context, as it is implied by ""protesters calling for"".
- The reference keeps ""Mong Kok area"" instead of ""region"", which is more specific and accurate.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of structure, word choice, and specificity. The reference translation is clearer, more concise, and maintains a higher level of accuracy in terms of location and action.

|Source: Jeemenis jõustus seitsmepäevane relvarahu Saudi Araabia juhitava sõjalise koalitsiooni ja šiiitidest mässuliste vahel.|
|Machine translation: In Yemen, a seven-day ceasefire came into force between the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the Shi'ite rebels.|
|Reference translation: In Yemen, a seven-day ceasefire came into force between the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and Shiite rebels.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""šiiitidest"" which refers to ""Shiite rebels"" in the context. The machine translation correctly translates this as ""the Shi'ite rebels,"" but omits the genitive form ""mässuliste"" (from ""mässulised,"" meaning ""militant"" or ""rebels"" in this context). The reference translation also omits this genitive form, which is a minor difference.
2. Both the machine and reference translations use ""the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia"" which is accurate and consistent.
3. The structure of the sentence is preserved in both translations, with the main event being the ""seven-day ceasefire"" and the context being the two parties involved.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate, with the main difference being the genitive form ""mässuliste"" that is not included. The reference translation also omits this detail, so the machine translation is consistent with the reference in terms of meaning, although it could be slightly more precise if it included the genitive form.

Source: Selles olukorras olles oleksime sellega rahul, ette vaadates aga mitte.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: If we are in this situation, we would be happy with this, but not looking ahead.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: If we were in this situation, we would be happy with this, but not if we 'd be looking ahead.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation correctly captures the idea that being in the situation would bring happiness, but it omits the conditional aspect in the phrase ""ette vaadates aga mitte"" (which means ""but not if we were looking ahead"").
- The reference translation includes the conditional ""if we 'd be looking ahead"" to express the idea that the happiness would not extend to a future perspective.

Step 5: Identify the difference
The main difference is the absence of the conditional in the machine translation, which changes the meaning slightly, making it sound like the act of looking ahead is actively happening, rather than a hypothetical situation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not convey the conditional aspect of the source text, which is crucial for understanding the intended meaning. The reference translation provides a more accurate representation of the original Estonian sentence.

|Source: Õnnetuses keegi vigastada ei saanud, kuid merre voolas umbes kakssada tonni naftat.|
|Machine translation: Nobody was injured in the accident, but about two hundred tonnes of oil fell into the sea.|
|Reference translation: Nobody was injured in the accident, but about two hundred tonnes of oil flowed into the sea.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses the verb ""vigastada"" (to injure), which is intransitive and implies that no one was physically harmed. The machine translation, however, uses ""fell into"" (fell), which is a more literal translation of ""voolas"" (flowed), but it suggests a physical impact or dropping, rather than the passive state of oil being present in the sea.
2. The verb ""voolas"" in the source text is a more appropriate choice for the context, as it indicates the continuous flow of oil into the sea, which is a more accurate description than the idea of oil ""falling"" (a discrete action) into the sea.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the choice of verb to describe the oil's presence in the sea. The source text uses ""voolas"" (flowed), which is more accurate in conveying the continuous action, while the machine translation uses ""fell,"" which implies a more sudden and discrete event. The reference translation captures this nuance better.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Järelikult peab olema mõni eesmärk, mida ei soovita teise nimel.
Machine translation: Consequently, there must be some objective that is not wanted on behalf of the other.

Step 2: Identify differences in word order or structure.
- The source text starts with ""Järelikult"" (Consequently), which is correctly translated as ""Consequently"" in both.
- The source text has ""mõni eesmärk"" (some objective), which is translated the same in both.
- The phrase ""mida ei soovita"" (that is not wanted) is the same in both translations.
- The phrase ""teise nimel"" (on behalf of the other) is also the same in both.

Step 3: Check for any mistranslated or omitted words.
There are no mistranslated or omitted words in the machine translation.

Step 4: Assess the overall meaning and fluency.
The overall meaning of the sentence is preserved in the machine translation, and the sentence structure is similar to the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation only in the word order, with ""mõni eesmärk"" (some objective) coming before ""mida ei soovita"" (that is not wanted) in the source text, while in the reference translation, the order is reversed. However, this difference does not significantly affect the meaning. The translation is mostly accurate and fluent, with only a minor rearrangement of phrases.

|im_start| Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Evald cannot believe that Pille is so attached to her.

|im_start| Step 4: Compare the subject and verb
In the source, the subject is ""Evald"" and the verb is ""suuda uskuda"" (to be able to believe). The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Evald"" as ""You"" and changes the verb to ""cannot believe"" (implying a generic belief, not specifically Evald's).

|im_start| Step 5: Compare the object and additional information
The object is ""Pille on temasse niivõrd kiindunud"" (Pilate is so attached to her). The machine translation omits the possessive pronoun ""temasse"" (to her) and changes ""niivõrd kiindunud"" (so attached) to ""so attached to her"" without specifying the degree of attachment.

|im_start| Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in several aspects:
1. Incorrect subject: ""You"" instead of ""Evald""
2. Verb change: ""suuda uskuda"" is not translated accurately
3. Missing possessive pronoun: ""temasse"" is not included
4. Degree of attachment: ""niivõrd kiindunud"" is not translated with the same intensity as in the reference

To improve the quality, the machine translation should be: ""Evald cannot believe how attached Pille is to her.""

|im_start|>

Step 1: Understand the source text
The source text in Estonian discusses the importance of attention and active valuation, as mentioned by Jollimore, for understanding the concept of value as it relates to philosophers.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation states that the attention and active valuation ""must be attributed to the value of most philosophers."" This suggests that the focus is on the attribution of value to philosophers, rather than the act of philosophers attributing value.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation
The reference translation, on the other hand, says that ""most philosophers think that the attention and active valuation refer to the attribution of value."" This implies that the philosophers' perspective is about the connection between their attention and active valuation and the act of attributing value, not necessarily their own value.

Step 4: Analyze the differences
The main difference lies in the interpretation of the verb ""väärtustamist"" (valuation) in the source text. The machine translation suggests that the act of valuation is something that philosophers possess, while the reference translation indicates that it is the act of attributing value that philosophers think about or consider.

Conclusion:
The machine translation slightly misrepresents the source text by implying that philosophers possess the value, whereas the reference translation correctly conveys that the philosophers' thoughts are on the attribution of value. The machine translation could be improved by rephrasing to: ""Most philosophers consider the attention and active valuation that Jollimore discusses as referring to the attribution of value.""

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: Punase Risti esindaja teatel tuli Venemaa samm neile üllatusena.
- Machine translation: According to the Red Cross representative, Russia's move came as a surprise to them.

The machine translation has the following differences:
1. The source text uses ""Punase Risti esindaja"" (Red Cross representative) as a compound noun, while the machine translation separates it into ""the Red Cross representative"".
2. The source text includes ""teatel"" (in the representative's statement), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. It implies the information was conveyed through a statement.
3. The source text has ""tuli"" (came) followed by ""Venemaa samm"" (Russia's move), while the machine translation reverses the order to ""Russia's move came"".

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: According to the Red Cross representative, Russia's move came as a surprise to them.
- Reference translation: According to a Red Cross representative, Russia 's move came as a surprise to them.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the separation of ""Red Cross representative"" into ""a Red Cross representative"" in the reference. The rest of the sentence structure is similar.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the way it separates ""Red Cross representative"" and omits ""teatel"" (in the representative's statement), which slightly changes the meaning and context.

Source: Kolmandat tüüpi toiming tekitab asja, eesmärk on valmistatav asi.
Machine translation: A third-type operation creates the cause, the aim being the preparation of the matter.

Step 2: Identify differences in sentence structure.
- In the source, ""eesmärk on valmistatav asi"" is translated as ""the aim is the preparation of the matter"" in the machine translation. The structure is slightly different, with ""eesmärk"" (aim) being translated as ""the aim"" and ""valmistatav asi"" (prepared thing) as ""the preparation of the matter.""

Step 3: Analyze the meaning.
- The source text states that the third-type operation creates ""a thing"" and the purpose is that the thing is being prepared. The machine translation, while conveying a similar idea, rephrases it to emphasize the cause (creation) and the preparation as the aim.

Step 4: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: The third-type operation creates a thing, the aim is the thing being prepared.

Step 5: Evaluate the differences.
- The reference translation maintains the same structure and meaning as the source, with ""a thing"" and ""the thing being prepared"" clearly stated. The machine translation, while not incorrect, does differ slightly in emphasis and structure.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of emphasis and structure, but it still conveys the core meaning.

1. **Source**: Seetõttu on mugav fiktsioon eeldada, et ta tegeleb mingite eriliste objektidega, millel on ainult matemaatilised omadused.

2. **Machine Translation**: It is therefore convenient to expect a fiction that it will deal with some specific objects with only mathematical properties.
   - English (Machine Translation): The difference here is the use of ""expect"" instead of ""assume"" in the machine translation. ""Expect"" implies a desire or anticipation, while ""assume"" suggests a logical deduction or default position.

3. **Analysis**: The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the choice of words ""expect"" and ""assume."" The reference translation uses ""assume,"" which is more suitable in this context as it aligns with the idea that fiction naturally takes on certain characteristics without needing to actively anticipate them.

1. **Reading the source**: The source text is in Estonian and discusses the presentation of the importance of a geometric sequence by Herakleitos, as taught by Fränkeli.

2. **Comparing the machine translation (MT)**: The MT states, ""According to Flunkeli, teaching was shown to be of geostrategic importance in Herakleito."" Here, the MT has made the following changes:
   - ""Fränkeli"" is translated as ""Flunkeli"" (a possible error or mistranslation).
   - ""esitas"" (presented) is translated as ""was shown to be"" (a less direct translation).
   - ""geomeetrilise jada kosmilisest tähtsusest"" (the importance of a geometric sequence) is translated as ""geostrategic importance"" (a different context, as ""geostrategic"" does not capture the specific meaning of the original phrase).

3. **Comparing the reference translation (RT)**: The RT correctly translates the source as, ""According to Fränkel, it was Heraclitus who presented the teaching of the importance of a geometric sequence.""

4. **Analysis**: The main differences between the MT and RT are:
   - The name ""Fränkeli"" is mistranslated as ""Flunkeli"" in the MT, which is likely a typo or a mistranscription.
   - The MT incorrectly translates the concept of ""geomeetrilise jada kosmilisest tähtsusest"" as ""geostrategic importance,"" losing the specific reference to a geometric sequence.
   - The RT correctly identifies Heraclitus as the one presenting the teaching, while the MT implies that Flunkeli is the one doing so.

5. **Conclusion**: The machine translation has significant inaccuracies in terms of proper names and the specific meaning of the phrase, which affects the overall quality of the translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the original source.

|Machine translation: The final Karlowitz peace ended in 1699 wars of the Holy League with the Osman state.|
|Reference translation: The final Karlowitz peace ended in 1699 the wars of the Holy League with the Ottoman state.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Lõplik Karlowitzi rahu""** (Final Karlowitz peace) - Both translations capture this phrase correctly.
2. **""lõpetas aastal 1699""** (ended in 1699) - The machine translation has the same meaning, but the word order is slightly different (""in 1699"" is moved to the end).
3. **""Püha Liiga sõjad""** (wars of the Holy League) - The machine translation uses ""Osmanite riigiga"" instead of ""the Holy League."" This is a mistake, as ""Püha Liiga"" refers to the Holy League, not the Ottoman state.
4. **""Osmanite riigiga""** (with the Osman state) - The machine translation incorrectly translates this to ""with the Osman state,"" while the reference translation correctly uses ""the Ottoman state.""

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the phrase ""Osmanite riigiga,"" which should be translated as ""the Ottoman state"" to maintain the correct context. The rest of the translation is accurate, but the error in this part reduces the overall quality of the translation.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Prokuratuur pakkus Kenderile võimalust ehk kokkuleppemenetlust.""
- Machine translation: ""The Public Prosecutor's Office offered Kender a choice, or an agreement procedure.""

Step 2: Identify key differences.
- The machine translation uses ""a choice"" instead of ""an opportunity"" (võimalust in Estonian).
- The machine translation adds ""or"" after ""choice,"" which is not present in the source text.

Step 3: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
- Source: ""Prokuratuur pakkus Kenderile võimalust ehk kokkuleppemenetlust.""
- Reference translation: ""The Public Prosecutor 's Office offered Kender an opportunity, that is, a compromise procedure.""

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text by translating ""võimalust"" as ""an opportunity"" and adds the clarifying phrase ""that is"" to explain ""ehk"" (which means ""or, that is"" in this context).
- The machine translation omits the clarifying phrase ""ehk"" and replaces it with ""or,"" which changes the meaning slightly.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:
1. It translates ""võimalust"" as ""a choice"" instead of ""an opportunity,"" which loses the nuance of a favorable situation or arrangement.
2. It adds ""or"" after ""choice,"" which is not present in the source text and introduces a potential ambiguity.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should convey the meaning of ""an opportunity"" (võimalust) and maintain the connection between the choice and the compromise procedure without the unnecessary ""or."" The reference translation does this more accurately.

|Machine translation: He later realised that Rhodisi's representatives had deceived him and tried to withdraw from the Treaty.|
|Reference translation: He later realised that Rhodes ' representatives had deceived him and tried to withdraw from the Treaty.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""Rhodesi esindajad"" (Rhodesi's representatives), which is a genitive form in Estonian. The machine translation correctly translates this to ""Rhodisi's representatives"" in English, but the reference translation uses the possessive apostrophe 's, which is a more common way to express possession in English.
2. The source text uses the word ""taganeda"" (to withdraw), which is the infinitive form. The machine translation correctly translates this to ""to withdraw"" in English, but the reference translation omits the '-ed' ending, resulting in ""withdraw"" as the verb.
3. The source text has no punctuation errors, but the machine translation adds a comma after ""Rhodisi's representatives"" which is not present in the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate, but there are minor differences in punctuation and possessive form that make the reference translation slightly more natural in English. The meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is a more idiomatic and standard way of expressing the same idea.

Step 1: Compare the source text to the machine translation.
Source: Kõige entusiastlikumad ja andekamad magistrandid
Machine translation: The most enthusiastic and talented magistrates

Difference: The source text uses ""magistrandid"" (master's students), while the machine translation uses ""magistrates,"" which is a general term for people holding a position, not specifically referring to master's students.

Step 2: Compare the rest of the sentence.
Source: aetakse filosoofiast ära sõnadega, et filosoofia pole naljaasi.
Machine translation: are being expelled from the philosophy by saying that philosophy is not a joke.

The machine translation captures the meaning that someone is being expelled from philosophy due to a statement about philosophy not being a joke. However, the verb ""aetakse"" (are being expelled) is in the present continuous tense, which might imply a continuous action, while the source text suggests a singular event.

Step 3: Compare to the reference translation.
Reference translation: The most enthusiastic and talented master 's students are being expelled from philosophy by saying that philosophy is not a joke.

The reference translation correctly translates ""magistrandid"" as ""master's students"" and uses the present continuous tense, similar to the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in that it uses ""magistrates"" instead of ""master's students"" and does not specify a singular event with the verb tense. The main difference is in the term for students, which affects the accuracy of the translation. The rest of the sentence, regarding the expulsion and the reason, is similar in meaning.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Soomusrongi Rügemendi, kus teenis kuus aastat soomusrongil Kapten Irv.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: A Soomusrong Rübig served six years on a Finnish train, Kapten Irv.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Armored Train Regiment, where Captain Irv served for six years on the armored train.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""Soomusrongi Rügemendi"" which refers to a specific regiment or command related to an armored train (Soomusrong = Estonian for ""armored train"").
- The machine translation translates ""Soomusrongi Rügemendi"" as ""A Soomusrong Rübig,"" which seems to be a misunderstanding or a loss of context, as ""Rübig"" is not a direct translation and does not convey the meaning of a regiment or command.

- The source text also mentions ""kuus aastat"" (six years) and ""soomusrongil"" (on the armored train), which are correctly translated in the machine translation as ""six years on a Finnish train.""

- The reference translation correctly identifies the context as an ""Armored Train Regiment"" and uses ""where"" to introduce the location of Captain Irv's service.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The main difference lies in the translation of ""Soomusrongi Rügemendi,"" which should be translated as ""Armored Train Regiment"" to maintain the meaning and context.
- The machine translation omits the word ""Regiment"" and replaces it with ""Rübig,"" which is incorrect.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not accurately convey the meaning of ""Soomusrongi Rügemendi"" as an armored train regiment, instead translating it as a potentially unrelated term ""A Soomusrong Rübig."" The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation.

Machine translation: It is assumed that either the wall or the main valley of the urban environment were the first to be prepared.

|im_end|

Analysis:
1. **""linnuse ringmüür""** (fortress ring wall) vs. **""wall""**: The machine translation omits the word ""fortress"" which is crucial for understanding the context, referring to a specific type of wall.
2. **""peatorn""** (main tower) vs. **""main valley""**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""peatorn"" as ""main valley,"" which is not a suitable term for a tower in this context. The reference translation correctly uses ""main tower.""
3. **""prepared""** vs. **""completed""**: The machine translation uses ""prepared"" instead of ""completed,"" which implies an earlier stage of work, whereas the reference translation suggests that something was finished first.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity (omitting ""fortress"" and replacing ""peatorn"" with ""main valley""), and in the verb choice (using ""prepared"" instead of ""completed""). The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate translation of the source text.

- Machine translation: ""The new Badoglio Government has removed the last elements of fascist rule by banning the fascist party.""

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The source text uses double quotes around ""Badoglio valitsus"" (which is a proper noun referring to a specific government), while the machine translation does not.
- The source text uses the word ""eemaldas"" (removed) in its original form, while the machine translation uses ""has removed"" which is a more common English phrasing.
- The source text includes the verb ""keelustades"" (banning) as a separate clause, whereas the machine translation combines it into a single sentence.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: ""The new ' Badoglio Government ' removed the last elements of fascist rule by banning the fascist party.""

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation also uses double quotes around ""Badoglio Government"" to indicate it as a proper noun.
- The reference translation follows a similar structure to the source text, with the removal of elements and the banning of the party as separate clauses.

Conclusion:
The machine translation captures the main idea but loses some nuances in the original text, such as the double quotes and the slightly different sentence structure.

Machine translation: One alternative is the view that concepts take on the definition of meaning.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: One alternative is the view that concepts acquire meaning from the definition.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""take on"" which implies a process of adopting or assuming, while the reference translation uses ""acquire,"" which is more accurate in this context, as it means to gain or come into possession of something.
- The machine translation has ""the definition of meaning,"" while the reference translation has ""from the definition,"" which is slightly different but still conveys the same idea that meaning comes from the definition.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The main difference is the choice of verb (""take on"" vs. ""acquire""), which slightly alters the emphasis but does not change the overall meaning.
- The preposition ""of"" in ""the definition of meaning"" is replaced by ""from"" in the reference, which is a more natural way to express the idea in English.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the choice of verb and preposition. The core meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is slightly more natural and precise.

|Analysis|
1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning, with the main idea being that the real reason for something was the lack of preparedness for war among countries, with the exception of the aggressor.
2. The structure of the sentences is similar in both versions, with the key phrases ""Möödunud nädalatel"" (in the past few weeks), ""tõelise põhjusena"" (as the real reason), ""ei olnud sõjaks valmis"" (was not prepared for war), and ""peale agressori"" (apart from the aggressor) being accurately translated.
3. The only difference is the use of ""for this"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference translation. However, this does not significantly alter the meaning, as it can be inferred from the context that ""this"" refers to the situation being discussed.

Overall, the machine translation is of high quality and captures the essence of the source text. The minor difference in the phrase ""for this"" does not detract from the overall meaning.

|Reference translation: Frankfurt feels that the authority of love is closely linked to this pressing and unretreating need to defend the integrity of the self.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""tungiva ja taandumatu vajadus"" which translates to ""pressing and unretreating need"" in both the machine and reference translations. However, the reference translation rephrases it as ""pressing and unretreating need to defend the integrity of the self,"" which is a more accurate and idiomatic expression in English, emphasizing the personal nature of the unity being defended.

2. The machine translation uses ""defend unity,"" which is a general term, while the reference translation specifies ""the integrity of the self,"" which is more precise and conveys the idea that the unity being protected is an internal, personal concept.

3. The source text ""meile"" (to us) is translated to ""me"" in both, but the reference translation adds ""the"" before ""self"" to make it ""the self,"" which is a more natural way to refer to oneself in English.

The source text refers to ""Siseveekogudes"" which is a specific term for ""inland waters"" in Estonian. The machine translation correctly captures this concept.

Step 2: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
Source: kasvatatud piimkala (dairy fish)
Reference translation: the milkfish

The source text mentions ""piimkala,"" which is the Estonian term for ""dairy fish"" or ""milkfish"" (specifically, a type of fish that is often associated with milk production due to its high fat content). The reference translation translates this as ""the milkfish,"" which is the correct term in English.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of ""dairy fish"" in the machine translation, which is a more general term that does not specify the milkfish. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses ""the milkfish,"" which is a more precise and accurate term for the specific fish being referred to.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it uses ""dairy fish"" instead of specifying ""the milkfish."" This results in a less accurate translation, as the reference translation provides a clearer and more specific context. The source text and reference translation convey the same information, but the machine translation loses some precision by not specifying the type of fish.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
- Source: ""Viimases lahingus hävitas Itaalia armee Austria rünnaku.""
- Machine translation: ""In the last battle, the Italian army destroyed Austria's attack.""
- Reference translation: ""In the last battle, the Italian army destroyed Austria's attack.""

The sentence structure is similar in all three versions, with the subject being ""the Italian army,"" the action being ""destroyed,"" and the object being ""Austria's attack."" The only difference is the inclusion of the possessive apostrophe in ""Austria's attack"" in the reference translation.

Step 2: Check for word order and agreement
- Source: ""Itaalia armee"" (Italian army) and ""Austria rünnaku"" (Austria's attack)
- Machine translation: ""the Italian army"" and ""Austria's attack""
- Reference translation: ""the Italian army"" and ""Austria's attack""

The word order is the same in both the machine and reference translations, and the possessive form is correctly used in both.

Step 3: Analyze differences
- The only difference is the presence of the apostrophe in ""Austria's attack"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference that does not affect the overall meaning, as it is clear that the attack belongs to Austria.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with the only difference being the possessive apostrophe in ""Austria's attack"" which is present in the reference translation. The meaning is preserved, and the core message is the same. The quality of the translation can be considered high, with a minor grammatical variation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Õiguskirjanduses on viidatud, et alati ei pruugi töövõtuleping olla sõlmitud füüsilise asja suhtes kehalises kujul.""
- Machine translation: ""The literary has indicated that a contract for work may not always be concluded on physical matters in a physical form.""

Difference: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""õiguskirjanduses"" (legal literature) as ""the literary"" and omits the word ""töövõtuleping"" (contract for work). It also changes ""füüsilise asja suhtes"" (in relation to a physical thing) to ""on physical matters.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""The literary has indicated that a contract for work may not always be concluded on physical matters in a physical form.""
- Reference translation: ""Legal literature has indicated that a contract for services does not always have to be concluded in relation to a physical thing in a physical form.""

Difference: The machine translation still uses ""the literary"" instead of ""legal literature"" as in the reference. It also refers to ""a contract for work"" instead of ""a contract for services,"" which is a more accurate translation of ""töövõtuleping.""

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the terms ""legal literature"" and ""contract for work/services."" The structure and meaning of the sentence are not accurately conveyed, leading to a lower quality translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Paavst suudles 14. mail 1999 koraani ja külastas 6. mail 2001 mošeed.""
- Machine translation: ""On 14 May 1999 the Pope was able to visit the Koran and visited mosques on 6 May 2001.""

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- The machine translation omits the verb ""suudles"" (kissed) from the source, which is a crucial part of the action.
- The machine translation uses ""was able to visit the Koran"" instead of ""koraani"" (the Koran), which is a direct translation of the source term.
- The machine translation adds ""mosques"" after ""visited"" without specifying that it's a mosque on 6 May 2001, while the source mentions ""mošeed"" (mosque) separately for each date.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: ""On 14 May 1999 the Pope kissed the Quran and visited a mosque on 6 May 2001.""

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The reference translation accurately captures the verb ""suudles"" (kissed) and the specific action of visiting the Koran.
- It also specifies ""a mosque"" for the second event, which is a more natural way to express the visit without listing all mosques.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the verb ""suudles"" (kissed) and the specificity of the mosque visit. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

1. **Source**: The original Estonian text uses ""paremäärmuslik Rahvusrinne"" which translates to ""better-estimated National Front"" or ""National Front considered to be more likely to win"" in English. The machine translation, however, simplifies this to ""an election favour"" which might lose the nuance of the Estonian term, suggesting a higher likelihood of success than just being favored.

2. **Machine translation**: The phrase ""peetud paremäärmuslik"" is translated as ""considered to be an election favour"" which is a reasonable attempt to convey the idea but omits the word ""paremäärmuslik"" (better-estimated) which might be important for the context.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation keeps the same structure and meaning as the source, maintaining the distinction that the National Front is ""considered to be an election favourite.""

Source: ""Radikaalne argument põhineb kas Karl Mannheimi või Karl Marxi teadmissotsioloogial.""
Machine translation: ""The Radical argument is based either on the sociologist of knowledge of Karl Mannheim or Karl Marx.""

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The source text uses ""teadmissotsioloogial"" (sociology of knowledge), while the machine translation uses ""sociologist of knowledge.""
- The source text uses ""kas"" (either), which is correctly translated as ""either"" in the machine translation.
- The source text has no punctuation at the end, while the machine translation adds a period.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation is identical to the source text, except for the punctuation at the end, which is consistent with the machine translation.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with the main difference being the word order for ""sociology of knowledge"" and the absence of punctuation at the end.

|Machine translation: The worst film, scenario, female chief and director's prize went to Dirty Love.|
|Reference translation: The awards for the worst film, scenario, woman in a lead role and director went to Dirty Love.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Halvima filmi""** (the worst film) - Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning, but the reference uses ""worst film"" which is a more direct and common phrasing.
2. **""stsenaariumi""** (scenario) - The machine translation uses ""scenario"" correctly, but the reference adds ""film"" before it, making it ""film scenario"" for clarity.
3. **""naispeaosa""** (female lead role) - The machine translation translates this as ""female chief,"" which is not accurate. The reference correctly translates it as ""woman in a lead role.""
4. **""ja režissööri auhinnad""** (and director's prize) - The machine translation omits ""director's"" and combines it with ""female chief,"" creating an incorrect phrase. The reference separates it as ""director"" and keeps the context clear.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation has some inaccuracies, particularly in the handling of ""naispeaosa"" and the combination of ""female chief"" and ""director's prize."" The reference translation is clearer and more faithful to the original Estonian text. The differences lie in the choice of words and the structure, which affects the meaning and readability of the sentence.

|Machine translation: This is not at all about the importance of people to the universe, but about the importance of people for the people.|
|Reference translation: This is not at all about the importance of people to the universe, but about the importance of people to people.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""inimeste tähtsusest universumile"" which translates to ""the importance of people to the universe"" in both the machine and reference translations.
2. The key difference lies in the phrase ""vaid inimeste tähtsusest inimestele,"" which in English is translated as ""but about the importance of people for the people"" in the machine translation and ""but about the importance of people to people"" in the reference translation.

The machine translation has a small error in this part, as ""for the people"" suggests a benefit or purpose for a group, while ""to people"" indicates a relationship or connection between individuals. The reference translation captures the intended meaning more accurately, emphasizing the interpersonal significance rather than a functional one.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the choice of preposition ""for"" instead of ""to,"" which changes the focus from the relationship between individuals to a more general purpose or benefit. The reference translation is more precise and faithful to the original Estonian text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Identify the key elements in the source text
- pisiKiltsi (a proper noun, likely a place name)
- vasallilinnus (vassal stronghold)
- kagupoolse ümartorni (south-eastern round tower)
- majalinnuse lõunakülje nurk (southern side of the house stronghold)
- 2007 (the year)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: PisiKilts left in the County of the Roundtable, South-East Roundgates and Coast Areas, 2007
- Reference translation: pisiKiltsi vassal stronghold, cornder of the south-eastern round tower and southern side of the house stronghold, 2007

Step 3: Analyze differences
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""vasallilinnus"" as ""left"" or ""County of the Roundtable,"" which is not a suitable translation for a stronghold. The correct term should be ""vassal stronghold.""
- ""kagupoolse ümartorni"" is translated as ""South-East Roundgates,"" which is a misinterpretation. The correct translation is ""south-eastern round tower.""
- ""majalinnuse lõunakülje nurk"" is translated as ""Coast Areas,"" which is unrelated to the context. The correct translation is ""southern side of the house stronghold.""

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accurately conveying the meaning of the source text. It incorrectly translates key terms and concepts, leading to a loss of context and clarity. The reference translation better captures the meaning, including the specific location details and the type of structures mentioned.

|Reference translation: The impact of Byzantine architecture, especially in places of worship, can be found in different regions, from Egypt and Arabia to Russia and Romania.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Bütsantsi arhitektuuri"" vs ""Byzantine architecture"":** The machine translation uses ""Bütsantsi"" which is likely a typo or a mistranslation, as it does not correspond to the correct term ""Byzantine"" in English. The reference translation correctly uses ""Byzantine architecture.""
2. **""pühakodades"" vs ""places of worship"":** Both translations convey the same meaning, but the machine translation uses a direct translation, while the reference translation uses a more idiomatic phrase in English.
3. **""Araabiast"" vs ""Arabia"":** The machine translation uses ""Araabiast,"" which is not a standard term for ""Arabia"" in English. The reference translation is more accurate with ""Arabia.""
4. **""Venemaa"" vs ""Russia"":** The machine translation uses ""Venemaa,"" which is a misspelling or incorrect translation of ""Russia."" The reference translation is correct.

Analysis:

1. **""rünnatakse"" vs ""are also being attacked"":** The machine translation uses ""rünnatakse"" which means ""attacked"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses ""are also being attacked"" in the present continuous tense. The continuous tense is more appropriate here to indicate an ongoing action.

2. **""suurtükkidest"" vs ""large parts"":** The source text uses ""suurtükkidest,"" which is a genitive form of ""suurtükki"" (large parts), while the machine translation uses ""large parts."" The genitive form is not directly translated, but the meaning is clear in the context.

3. **""ja raketiheitjatest"" vs ""and rocket launchers"":** The source text includes ""ja"" (and) and ""raketiheitjatest"" (rocket launchers), which is a genitive form of ""rakettiheitja"" (rocket launcher). The machine translation correctly translates ""ja"" as ""and"" but omits the genitive form, using ""rocket launchers"" instead. The genitive form is important to convey possession in this context.

4. **""Venemaa territooriumilt"" vs ""Russian territory"":** Both translations correctly convey the meaning of ""Venemaa territooriumilt"" (from Russian territory), but the machine translation uses ""Russian territory"" directly, which is a more common and direct way of expressing the same idea.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in tense, the genitive form of ""suurtükkidest"" and ""rakettiheitjatest,"" and omits the genitive form in the second part. The reference translation provides a more natural and accurate English equivalent, especially in terms of tense and the specific term ""artillery guns"" to better convey the meaning of ""suurtükkidest.""

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""kuulsa näitleja ja produtsendi"" (famous actor and producer), which is translated as ""the famous actor and producer of George Cloney"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""the famous actor and producer"" without specifying that it's George Clooney's producer.
2. The machine translation omits the phrase ""tema isa"" (his father), which is present in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as it provides additional context about one of the participants.

- ""presidendi eriesindaja"" (Special Representative of the President) is translated accurately.
- ""NATO juures"" (at NATO) is translated as ""to NATO"", which is also correct but less specific.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Russian President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed the Special Representative of the President to NATO, Dmitri Rogozin.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation uses ""dismissed"" instead of ""released"", which is a more accurate term for the act in this context.
- The reference omits ""from a position"" or ""from his post"" which is not explicitly stated in the source but is implied by the verb ""vabastas"" in Estonian.

Conclusion:
The machine translation has some differences in nuance and specificity compared to the reference translation. It correctly identifies the roles of the individuals and the organization but loses some context by translating ""vabastas ametist"" as ""released"" instead of ""dismissed"". The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text in English.

|im_start|
The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly identical, with only a minor difference in punctuation. The machine translation has a space after the comma in ""and their next son,"" while the reference translation omits this space. This difference is a typographical style choice and does not affect the meaning of the sentence. The core information about the birth years of Robert and Ludvig is accurately conveyed in both translations.

In terms of quality evaluation, the machine translation is of high quality as it maintains the meaning and structure of the source text. The only potential issue is the minor punctuation inconsistency, which might be considered a minor error if strict adherence to English punctuation rules is desired. Overall, the translation is clear and faithful to the source.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Kõik ained seal koosnevad neljast elemendist õhust, maast, tulest ja veest, mille proportsioonid segus määravad aine omadused.""
- Machine translation: ""All substances in it consist of four elements of air, land, fire and water, the proportions of which determine the characteristics of the substance.""

The differences are:
1. ""õhust"" (air) is translated as ""air"" in both, but the capitalization is different (in the source, it's lowercase).
2. ""maast"" (earth) is translated as ""land"" in both, but the capitalization is different (in the source, it's lowercase).
3. ""tulest"" (fire) is translated as ""fire"" in both, but the capitalization is different (in the source, it's lowercase).
4. ""veest"" (water) is translated as ""water"" in both, but the capitalization is different (in the source, it's lowercase).
5. The phrase ""mille proportsioonid segus"" (the proportions of which) is translated as ""the proportions of which"" in both, but the word order is slightly different in the source.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""All substances in it consist of four elements of air, land, fire and water, the proportions of which determine the characteristics of the substance.""
- Reference translation: ""All substances in it consist of four elements of air, earth, fire and water, the proportions of which determine the characteristics of the substance.""

The differences are:
1. ""maast"" is translated as ""earth"" in the reference, while in the machine translation it's ""land"" (consistent with the source, but not the reference).
2. The capitalization of ""air,"" ""fire,"" and ""water"" is consistent between the machine translation and the reference.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with differences mainly in the capitalization of ""air,"" ""land,"" ""fire,"" and ""water."" The reference translation uses ""earth"" instead of ""land"" for ""maast,"" which is a minor difference in meaning. Overall, the machine translation captures the essence of the source text, but the capitalization inconsistencies and the use of ""land"" instead of ""earth"" are areas for improvement.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|

1. **Source analysis**: The source text is in Estonian and discusses Stoic philosophers, specifically mentioning Chrysippus and Benedict Spinoza, who are warned against a certain type of passion that is described as ""palavikulise"" (fevered) and ""kergesti pettuva"" (easily disappointed), while also supporting ""kosmilist armastust"" (cosmic love).

2. **Machine translation analysis**: The machine translation attempts to convey the same idea but with some differences. It translates ""palavikulise"" as ""palavian"" and ""kergesti pettuva"" as ""easy-to-swindled,"" which might not capture the exact meaning of the original term. It also uses ""easyly disappointed"" instead of ""kergesti pettuva,"" which is a less accurate translation of the Estonian.

3. **Reference translation analysis**: The reference translation accurately captures the essence of the source by translating ""palavikulise"" as ""fevered"" and ""kergesti pettuva"" as ""easily disappointed,"" which better reflects the original meaning. It also maintains the structure and context, mentioning the Stoic philosophers from Chrysippus to Benedict Spinoza.

4. **Comparison**: The machine translation has some inaccuracies in the choice of words and the way it expresses the disappointment aspect. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more precise and idiomatic translation.

5. **Quality evaluation**: The machine translation has a moderate level of quality, as it conveys the main idea but with some errors in nuance and word choice. The reference translation is of higher quality, as it more accurately captures the meaning and tone of the original text.

|Machine translation: There was an assumption that it was possible that it was precisely for this reason that he was silent in the phosphorus war.|
|Reference translation: Aare guessed that this might have been the reason why he was silent in the phosphorite war.|

|Analysis:|
1. **""Aare oletas""** - Machine translation: ""There was an assumption"" (implied by ""that it was possible"")
2. **""et võimalik""** - Machine translation: ""that it was possible"" (direct translation)
3. **""et just sellepärast""** - Machine translation: ""precisely for this reason"" (translated as a more formal reason, but ""just"" is lost)

|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the structure and meaning of the source text and machine translation.
Source: Vanim ja suurim ülikool on 1811 rajatud Oslo Ülikool.
Machine translation: The most ancient and largest university is the 1811 Oslo University.

In the source text, ""Vanim ja suurim ülikool"" refers to ""the oldest and largest university,"" and ""on 1811 rajatud"" indicates that it was founded in 1811. The university's name, ""Oslo Ülikool,"" is mentioned at the end.

Step 2: Identify differences between the machine translation and reference translation.
Machine translation: The most ancient and largest university is the 1811 Oslo University.
Reference translation: The oldest and largest university is the Oslo University, founded in 1811.

Difference 1: The machine translation uses ""the 1811 Oslo University"" which places the year of foundation as a descriptor, while the reference translation separates the university's name from the founding year with ""founded in 1811.""

Difference 2: The reference translation uses ""the Oslo University"" with a definite article, while the machine translation omits it, making it sound like a generic statement.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation because it combines the university's name with the year of foundation, which can lead to confusion. It also omits the definite article, which is important for clarity and proper noun reference.

Conclusion: The machine translation could be improved by rephrasing it to say, ""The oldest and largest university, Oslo University, was founded in 1811,"" to better match the structure and clarity of the reference translation.

Both the machine translation and the reference translation have a similar sentence structure, with the main components (time, event, and subject) preserved: ""After World War II"", ""the country"", and ""the Soviet Union's sphere of influence"".

Step 2: Check for differences in wording
The machine translation uses ""Nõukogude Liidu"" which is the Estonian term for ""Soviet Union"". In the reference translation, it is directly translated as ""Soviet Union"". This is a minor difference, as both phrases refer to the same entity.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the difference
""Nõukogude Liidu"" is the original name in Estonian, while ""Soviet Union"" is a more commonly used English term. The reference translation is more idiomatic and clear for English speakers, but the machine translation is still accurate in conveying the meaning.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the use of the specific name for the Soviet Union. The core meaning is the same, and the structure is consistent with the reference translation. The main issue is a matter of style and familiarity, not a significant loss of meaning.

Overall quality evaluation: The machine translation is of high quality, with only a slight loss in fluency due to the use of a less common name. The meaning is preserved, and the translation is faithful to the source text.

- Machine translation: Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz considered emotion to be vague perceptions and Kant's pathological love.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- The machine translation adds the possessive 's' after ""Kant"" to indicate that it is referring to Kant's love, which is not present in the source text. The source text simply states ""Kant patoloogiliseks armastuseks"" (Kant as pathological love), without specifying whose love.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The reference translation omits the possessive 's' after ""Kant"" and maintains the same structure as the source text, which is clearer and more faithful to the original meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation by specifying ""Kant's"" love, which is not present in the source text. The reference translation is a more accurate representation of the original Estonian sentence, as it omits the unnecessary possessive and keeps the focus on the concept of Kant's love being described as pathological.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation has ""winters"" and ""cylinders"" which are not present in the source text or the reference translation. These seem to be errors or mistranslations.
- The source text mentions ""tallide"" (tallies or stables), ""küünide"" (barns), and ""majadega"" (houses). The machine translation correctly translates ""tallide"" as ""houses"" but mistranslates ""küünide"" as ""cylinders"" and omits ""majadega"" entirely.
- The reference translation accurately translates ""tallide"" as ""stables"" and ""küünide"" as ""barns"", which are more appropriate in the context of a historical or geographical description.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the incorrect translation of ""küünide"" as ""cylinders"" and the absence of ""majadega."" The reference translation is more accurate, using ""stables"" and ""barns"" instead of ""cylinders"" and including ""houses"" as well. The overall quality of the machine translation could be improved by correcting these errors.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

**Step 1: Compare source and reference translation**
- Source: Tema esimeseks õnnitlejaks osutub vallavanem Raivo Tiik, kelle naine on samas haiglas, ainult et profülaktilistel põhjustel.
- Reference: The first to congratulate him is the rural municipality mayor, Raivo Tiik, whose wife is in the same hospital, only for prophylactic reasons.

**Differences:**
1. ""vallavanem"" (mayor of a rural municipality) is not translated accurately in the machine translation, it is translated as ""Chief"" which might be a general term and not specific to a rural context.
2. ""esimeseks õnnitlejaks"" (first to congratulate) is translated as ""His first congratulations"" in the machine translation, which is a bit awkward and does not convey the same meaning as the source.

**Step 2: Compare machine translation and reference translation**
- Machine translation: His first congratulations go out to the Chief Raivo Tiik, whose wife is in the same hospital, only for prophylactic reasons.
- Reference translation: The first to congratulate him is the rural municipality mayor, Raivo Tiik, whose wife is in the same hospital, only for prophylactic reasons.

**Additional differences:**
3. The structure of the sentence is slightly different, with the reference translation placing ""The first to congratulate him"" at the beginning, while the machine translation separates it into two parts (""His first congratulations go out"" and ""to the Chief Raivo Tiik"").
4. The reference translation specifies ""rural municipality mayor"" which is more precise than ""Chief"" in the machine translation.

**Conclusion:**
The machine translation has some inaccuracies and differences in structure compared to the reference translation. It would be improved by translating ""vallavanem"" as ""rural municipality mayor"" and maintaining the original structure of the source sentence, placing ""The first to congratulate him"" at the beginning. Additionally, specifying ""rural"" in ""rural municipality mayor"" would enhance clarity.

Analysis:

1. **Subject and Person**: The source mentions ""Rebane"" as the subject, while the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""She"" (implied as Rebane's mother). The reference translation correctly identifies Rebane as the subject.

2. **Commander's Name**: The source states ""diviisiülem Franz Augsberger"" (division leader Franz Augsberger), which is a military rank. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""dividends, Franz Augsberger,"" which is a financial term, not a military rank.

3. **Action**: The source uses ""langenud"" (fallen), which likely refers to a fall in rank or position. The machine translation translates this as ""have fallen,"" but it's unclear if it's referring to a fall in rank or a financial context. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""has fallen"" in the context of a military rank.

4. **Role Change**: The source mentions ""temale kui vanemale rügemendiülemale"" (to her as the older regiment leader), indicating a promotion. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""to her mother as the chief of rhythm,"" which is unrelated to the military context. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""to him as the senior regiment commander,"" which is a promotion within the military hierarchy.

5. **Command Transfer**: The source states that the division command has been transferred to Rebane. The machine translation does not clearly convey this, while the reference translation does.

In summary, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of subject, military rank, and context, leading to a less accurate representation of the source text.

1. **Reading the source**: The source text in Estonian is ""Võidakse ka küsimärgi alla panna väide, et eelistuste rahuldamine peaks olema meie viimne eesmärk.""
2. **Reference translation**: The reference translation provided is ""The claim that satisfaction of preferences should be our ultimate objective can also be put into question.""
3. **Machine translation**: The machine translation is ""The claim that meeting preferences should be our ultimate objective is also being put into question.""

**Analysis**:
- **""Võidakse ka""**: In the source, this phrase translates to ""can also"" or ""can be"", which is correctly captured in the machine translation as ""is also being put into question"".
- **""küsimärgi alla panna väide""**: This part means ""to put a claim into question"". The machine translation captures this as ""being put into question"", which is accurate.
- **""et eelistuste rahuldamine""**: The source refers to ""the satisfaction of preferences"". The machine translation has ""meeting preferences"", which is not an exact match but conveys a similar meaning, as it implies the act of fulfilling preferences rather than satisfaction.
- **""peaks olema meie viimne eesmärk""**: The source states that it should be our ""final goal"". The machine translation omits the word ""final"" and instead uses ""ultimate"", which is a suitable synonym.

**Conclusion**: The machine translation captures the essence of the source text, with a slight difference in the expression of ""preferences"" (satisfaction vs. meeting). The overall meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is more precise in terms of the specific term ""satisfaction.""

Machine translation: However, the private sense in which he was present has awakened his ability to think.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: However , the bright Reason in him awakened his ability to think .

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text uses ""Temas olev ergas Mõistus"" which refers to a specific ""Ergas Mõistus"" (a concept or entity), likely a personified reason or intelligence.
- The machine translation translates this as ""the private sense in which he was present,"" which does not capture the specific entity or concept.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The reference translation uses ""the bright Reason"" which is a more direct and clear translation of ""Ergas Mõistus"" as a concept, while the machine translation uses a more general term ""private sense.""

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""Temas olev ergas Mõistus."" The reference translation captures the idea of a distinct, bright reason, while the machine translation translates it as a more abstract ""private sense."" This results in a less precise and potentially less clear meaning in the machine translation.

Difference: The machine translation has ""Lead"" instead of ""Leili"" (the name), and it changes ""teatab"" (reports) to ""reports its intention,"" which is a less direct translation. Additionally, it omits the possessive pronoun ""oma"" (her) before ""kavatsusest"" (plan).

Difference: The reference translation correctly uses ""Leili"" and maintains the possessive pronoun ""her"" by translating ""oma"" as ""her."" It also places ""in the cafeteria"" after ""Jürka"" to provide context, which is missing in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs significantly from the reference translation in terms of the subject (Leili vs. Lead), the verb (teatab vs. reports), and the possessive pronoun (oma vs. her).

1. **Source**: The original Estonian text uses ""sisse mahtusid"" (absorbed), which implies a process of inclusion or assimilation. The machine translation, however, uses ""was absorbed by"", which is a more passive and less nuanced way of expressing the same idea.

2. **Reference translation**: The reference translation rephrases the source to emphasize that the largest groups among the other nations were of European origin, using ""in turn"" to clarify the sequence of events. The machine translation omits ""in turn"" and instead says ""the largest groups of European origin make up their own,"" which is less clear about the sequence and implies a different structure.

3. **Ethnic groups**: The source mentions ""rahvad"" (peoples or ethnic groups), while the machine translation translates it as ""nations,"" which might lose the nuance of ethnic diversity.

4. **Structure**: The reference translation maintains the original structure of the source, with ""kelle seas moodustavad omakorra suurimad rühmad"" (the largest groups among which) being translated as ""among which, in turn, the largest groups were."" The machine translation rearranges this, making it less clear.

Overall, the machine translation loses some of the nuance and clarity in the original text, particularly in terms of the process of absorption and the emphasis on the largest groups being of European origin. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source.

|Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation|
Source: Gödeli teoreemist nähtub siiski, et aritmeetika ei saa olla lihtsalt definitsioonide ja nende järelduste hulk.
Machine translation: However, the Godel theorisation shows that arithmetic cannot be just a series of definitions and conclusions.

|Step 2: Identify differences between the two|
Difference 1: ""Gödeli teoreemist"" (Gödel's theorem) is translated as ""the Godel theorisation"" - The source uses the genitive form ""Gödeli"" to indicate possession, while the machine translation omits this.
Difference 2: ""nähtub siiski"" (however) is translated as ""However"" - The source uses the Estonian word ""siiski"" which is a more colloquial way of expressing ""however"" or ""still"", while the machine translation uses a more formal ""However"".
Difference 3: ""lihtsalt definitsioonide ja nende järelduste hulk"" (a set of definitions and conclusions) is translated as ""a series of definitions and conclusions"" - The source uses the word ""hulk"" (plural) which implies a collection, while the machine translation uses ""series"" which might suggest a linear sequence.

|Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation|
Reference translation: However , the Gödel theorem shows that arithmetic cannot be just a set of definitions and conclusions.

|Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies|
The machine translation has the following differences from the reference translation:
- It omits the genitive form ""Gödeli"" in the theorem's name, using ""the Godel"" instead.
- It uses ""However"" instead of ""siiski"" or a similar Estonian expression.
- It translates ""lihtsalt definitsioonide ja nende järelduste hulk"" as ""a series of definitions and conclusions"" instead of ""a set of definitions and conclusions"", which might imply a difference in emphasis on the collection aspect.

Overall, the machine translation captures the main idea but loses some nuances and accuracy in terms of the specific language structure and the way the theorem is referred to. The reference translation is more faithful to the original source in terms of word choice and expression.

Machine translation: ""On 31 January 2010, he called for greater attention to be paid to the shortcomings of those who have lost their jobs as a result of the financial crisis.""

Difference: The machine translation omits the phrase ""nende inimeste puudustele"" (the needs of those people) and replaces it with ""the shortcomings of those who have lost their jobs.""

1. **Source analysis**: The source text is in Estonian and describes various aspects of a tree using metaphorical language, such as ""mõru"" (bitter), ""õhkab viha"" (radiates hatred), ""peitub pettus"" (conceals fraud), and ""õistem"" (blossoms) with ""kurjuse õli"" (oil of evil).

2. **Machine translation analysis**: The machine translation attempts to convey the same meaning but with a different structure and word choices. It translates ""puu"" (tree) as ""murder,"" ""oksad"" (branches) as ""examinations,"" ""õhkab"" (radiates) as ""fuelled by,"" ""lehtedes"" (in leaves) as ""papers,"" and ""õistem"" (blossoms) as ""findings."" The metaphorical expressions are lost or altered, and the overall tone is more literal.

3. **Reference translation analysis**: The reference translation maintains the metaphorical language and structure, translating ""mõru"" as ""bitter,"" ""õhkab viha"" as ""radiating hatred,"" ""peitub pettus"" as ""conceals fraud,"" and ""õistem"" as ""oozes the oil of evil."" The translation is closer to the original meaning and tone.

4. **Comparison**: The machine translation deviates from the reference translation in several ways:
   - It translates ""puu"" as ""murder,"" which is a literal interpretation and loses the metaphorical meaning.
   - ""Oksad tapavad"" is translated as ""examinations kill,"" which is not a direct equivalent and changes the metaphor.
   - ""Vari"" is translated as ""papers"" instead of ""shadow,"" which is a significant loss of meaning.
   - ""Õistem"" is translated as ""findings"" instead of ""blossoms,"" altering the metaphor and the image.

5. **Quality evaluation**: The machine translation has a lower quality compared to the reference translation due to the loss of metaphorical expressions, altered meaning, and a less poetic tone.

|Analysis|
1. **""Aprilli lõpus peetud kõnes""** (In a speech at the end of April) - Both translations capture this part accurately.
2. **""oli president Vladimir Putin teatanud""** (President Putin announced) - The machine translation uses ""his commitments"" instead of ""the commitments"", which is a minor difference but still conveys the same meaning.
3. **""leppega võetud kohustuste""** (to the agreement) - The machine translation omits the preposition ""with"" (leppega) and instead uses ""to the agreement"" directly, which is a correct simplification but loses the nuance of a commitment made ""under"" the agreement.
4. **""ajutisest peatamisest""** (temporary suspension) - Both translations convey the same concept, but the machine translation uses ""of his commitments"" instead of ""of the commitments"", which is less precise.

|Machine translation: In Lithuania, the ruling coalition of the party involved in the corruption scandal has announced that it has left the government coalition.|
|Reference translation: In Lithuania, the Labour Party involved in the corruption scandal announced that it is leaving the government coalition.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""Leedus"" (Estonia), but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""Lithuania"". This is a significant difference in context.
2. The source text refers to ""Tööpartei valitsuskoalitsioonist"" (the Labour Party's government coalition), while the machine translation omits the specific party name, making it less clear who is leaving the coalition.
3. The verb ""teatas"" (announced) is translated as ""has announced"" in the machine translation, which is grammatically correct but loses the past tense in the reference translation, which is ""announced that it is leaving"" (future tense in the context).

- Samuti tungisid 352. aastal Rooma piiridesse alemannid.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
- In 35-2, the borders of Rome were also invaded by sub-doses.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
- In 352, the borders of Rome were also invaded by the Alemanns.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The machine translation has an error in the year mentioned, ""35-2"" instead of ""352.""
- It uses ""sub-doses"" which is a mistranslation, as the source text refers to ""alemannid,"" which are a Germanic tribe, not doses.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation accurately translates the year as ""352"" and identifies the invaders as ""the Alemanns.""

Step 6: Conclusion
- The machine translation is of lower quality due to the incorrect year (35-2 instead of 352) and the incorrect term ""sub-doses"" (should be ""Alemanns""). The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

|Machine translation: In Tallinn in Nokia, the Estonian Muusikaum Awards were held in 2012.|
|Reference translation: In Tallinn in Nokia Concert Hall, the gala of the 2012 Estonian Music Awards was held.|

|Analysis|
1. **Location**: The source mentions ""Tallinnas Nokia kontserdimajas"" (Tallinn's Nokia Concert Hall), but the machine translation omits the ""kontserdimajas"" part, which is crucial for specifying the venue. The reference translation includes this detail correctly.
2. **Event type**: The source uses ""Eesti Muusikaauhindade gala"" (Gala of Estonian Music Awards), while the machine translation simply combines ""Estonian Muusikaum Awards"" without specifying the gala aspect. The reference translation correctly adds ""the gala"" to clarify that it was a special event.
3. **Sentence structure**: The source sentence has a more natural flow, with ""toimus"" (took place) coming before the details of the event. The machine translation rearranges the information, making it less clear. The reference translation maintains a similar structure.

In summary, the machine translation loses important context about the venue (Nokia Concert Hall) and the specific type of event (gala), while the reference translation captures these details more accurately. The sentence structure is also less clear in the machine translation compared to the reference.

Step 1: Compare the structure and meaning of the source text and the machine translation.

Source: Üliselt on käsundusleping kestvusleping, kuid käsunduslepingu võib sõlmida ka ühekordseks teenuse osutamiseks.
Machine translation: A contract of bail-in is a lasting agreement, but a one-off contract can also be signed for the provision of a one-off service.

Step 2: Identify differences in structure and meaning.

- The source text starts with ""Üliselt"" (Generally), which is not translated in the machine translation. This sets the context for the following statement.
- The machine translation uses ""A contract of bail-in"" instead of ""käsundusleping"" (service contract), which is a direct translation but loses the specific context of the Estonian term.
- The machine translation omits the word ""kuid"" (but), which is crucial for the contrast between the two clauses.
- The machine translation uses ""one-off service"" instead of ""ühekordseks teenuse osutamiseks"" (for the provision of a one-off service), which is a more literal translation but less idiomatic in English.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation captures the main idea that a service contract can be both lasting and for a one-off service, but it loses some context and nuance by not including ""Üliselt"" and using a more general term ""bail-in"" instead of ""käsundusleping."" The reference translation better captures the original meaning and tone by including the context and using a more natural English structure.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not entirely inaccurate, but it could be improved by including the context-setting phrase ""Generally"" and maintaining the specific term ""käsundusleping"" to provide a more accurate and natural English equivalent.

Machine translation: The use of people grouped around a common object

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The source text includes ""sõnakasutamine"" (word usage), which is not present in the machine translation. This is a crucial part of the sentence, as it specifies the action being discussed.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: The use of people grouped around a common object
Reference translation: The use words by people grouped around a common object

Step 4: Analyze the difference.
- The reference translation adds ""words"" to clarify that the context is about the use of words, which is missing in the machine translation.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it omits the crucial term ""sõnakasutamine"" (word usage), which is essential for understanding the full meaning of the source text. The reference translation provides a more accurate and complete translation by including ""words.""

The machine translation has mistakenly identified ""Minose"" as ""Minsk's"" instead of ""Minoan"" which is the correct term referring to the ancient civilization.

Step 2: Compare the rest of the sentence.
Source: olid valdavalt kaupmehed, kes kauplesid meretaguste maadega.
Machine translation: were mostly traders who were trading with overseas countries.

This part of the sentence is structurally similar, but the term ""meretaguste maadega"" is not translated accurately. In Estonian, ""meretaguste maad"" means ""overseas countries,"" but the machine translation omits the word ""maad"" (countries).

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: The representatives of Minoan culture

The reference translation correctly uses ""Minoan"" instead of ""Minsk's"" and maintains the meaning of the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in two main ways:
1. It incorrectly translates ""Minose"" as ""Minsk's"" instead of ""Minoan.""
2. It omits the word ""maad"" (countries) in the phrase ""meretaguste maadega,"" which is crucial for conveying the meaning of trading with overseas territories.

To improve the quality of the translation, the machine translation should be corrected to say: ""The representatives of Minoan culture were mostly traders who traded with overseas countries.""

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Cardinal Ottobuon came to England to expel from the congregation all those who were still rebellious.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The source text mentions ""kogudusest välja heita"" (to expel from the congregation), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it says ""all those who were still rebel,"" which is a simplification and does not convey the context of expelling from a specific group (the congregation).
- The reference translation uses ""rebellious"" to describe the people being expelled, while the machine translation uses ""rebel,"" which is a noun and might not convey the same sense of being in a state of rebellion.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity and context. It does not capture the idea of expelling ""from the congregation"" and uses a noun (""rebel"") instead of an adjective (""rebellious"") to describe the people, which might affect the overall meaning and nuance of the sentence.

- Source: ""Oma valu või mõnd muud oma vaimuseisundit"" (My pain or some other of my mental states)
- Machine translation: ""My pain, or some other of my spirituality""

Difference: The machine translation uses ""spirituality"" instead of ""vaimuseisundit"" (mental states). This is a significant difference because ""vaimuseisundit"" specifically refers to mental or emotional conditions, whereas ""spirituality"" is a broader term that encompasses beliefs, values, and a connection to a higher power.

Step 2: Compare the rest of the sentence.

|Machine translation: The majority of the city is on the right side of the River Pahra, the railway tractor in the West.|
|Reference translation: The majority of the city is on the right bank of the River Pahra, west of the railway line.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Pahra jõe paremal kaldal""** (on the right side of the River Pahra) - The machine translation has ""raudteemagistraal"" (railway tractor), which is a literal translation that doesn't convey the intended meaning of the source. The correct translation should be ""right bank"" as in the reference, referring to the geographical side of the river.
2. **""raudteemagistraal läänes""** (in the West) - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""läänes"" (west) as ""railway tractor,"" which is a noun and not a direction. The reference translation correctly uses ""west of the railway line"" to describe the location.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the interpretation of ""raudteemagistraal"" and the placement of ""läänes."" The correct translation should be more focused on the geographical context and the relationship to the railway line, as in the reference.

The machine translation captures the essence of the source text, translating ""Esmakordselt"" (for the first time), ""kümne aasta"" (ten years), ""oli"" (was), ""kogu"" (across), and ""Euroopas"" (Europe) accurately. The structure and meaning are preserved.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: For the first time in ten years there was peace across Europe.
Reference translation: For the first time in ten years there was peace across Europe.

The only difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the presence of a period at the end of the sentence in the reference translation. The machine translation does not include this punctuation.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with only a minor difference in punctuation. The meaning and context are preserved, and the translation is clear. The difference in punctuation does not significantly affect the overall quality, as it is a common style choice.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has nominated Marin Kovtuni, the former Acting Governor of Murmanski Oblast, for the position of the Governor.

|Reference translation: German idealism was considered by Russell to be the belief that the world is made up of an idea, not matter.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""Saksa idealismi"" (German idealism) as the subject, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""German idealism considered"" which changes the meaning and structure.
2. The machine translation adds the unnecessary phrase ""burial one"" which is not present in the source or reference translation. This is a mistranslation and does not accurately convey the original idea.
3. The machine translation omits the word ""mitte"" (not) from the source, which is crucial to negate the material aspect in the sentence. This results in a loss of clarity in the meaning.
4. The reference translation correctly uses ""not matter"" to contrast with ""an idea,"" which is consistent with the source.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of structure, adding unnecessary words, and omitting important negation, leading to a less accurate representation of the source text. The reference translation better captures the meaning of Russell's view on German idealism.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: He considers himself to be very in relation to most of his fellow human beings and is angry with most of them, because they have so much higher status.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""very low"" while the reference translation uses ""very in relation to"" or ""very low in comparison"" (implied by ""very"" and ""relation""). The latter is more accurate in conveying the idea of relative self-perception.
- The machine translation uses ""angry for most of them"" while the reference translation uses ""angry with most of them."" The reference is more precise as it specifies the verb ""with"" which indicates the cause of the anger.
- The rest of the sentence structure is similar, but the nuances in the choice of words make a difference.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the expression of self-perception (""very low"" vs. ""very in relation to"") and the verb choice for the anger (""angry for"" vs. ""angry with"").

Machine translation: These tiny colours were used in the shipyards where the Left was built.

Step 2: Identify differences between the source and machine translation.
- ""pisiSelliseid"" in the source is translated as ""These tiny"" in the machine translation, but ""pisi"" is a proper noun referring to a specific dye or pigment, not a general term for tiny colors. The reference translation omits ""pisi"" and uses ""These dyes"" instead.
- ""värvipigmente"" in the source is translated as ""colours"" in the machine translation, which is a general term but might not convey the specific meaning of the Estonian word, which refers to a specific type of pigment.
- ""kasutati"" in the source is translated as ""were used"" in both, which is a correct translation.
- ""laevatöökodades"" in the source is translated as ""shipyards"" in both, which is accurate.
- ""kus Vasa ehitati"" in the source is translated as ""where the Left was built"" in the machine translation, but it should be ""kus Vasa"" (where Vasa) as the context refers to the ship Vasa, not a political entity called ""the Left.""

The difference is in the past participle ""been"" in the machine translation, which suggests a more uncertain or hypothetical past, whereas the reference uses the simple present ""be"" to convey a more general possibility.
2. The machine translation includes ""that"" after ""known,"" while the reference omits it. This is a minor difference, as ""that"" is often optional in English when the clause is clear.

|im_start| Step 5: Evaluate the quality
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a slight difference in tone and a minor grammatical variation. The meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is more concise and natural-sounding.

|im_end| Conclusion: The machine translation is of good quality overall, but there are a couple of areas where it could be improved for a more natural and precise translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

|Machine translation: The Röntgenikikik has provoked shock; Lord Kelvin even thought it to be a scam at the beginning.|
|Reference translation: The X-rays caused a shock; Lord Kelvin even thought it to be a scam at the beginning.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Röntgenikiirgus""** (X-rays) - The machine translation uses ""Röntgenikikik,"" which is likely a typo or a mistranslation. The correct term should be ""X-rays.""
2. **""kutsus esile""** (called forth) - The machine translation uses ""has provoked,"" which is a suitable equivalent for the action of calling forth a response, but it's not as idiomatic as the source text.
3. **""vapustuse""** (release, freedom) - The machine translation uses ""shock,"" which is a direct translation of the noun ""vapustuse"" but might be more appropriate to describe the emotional response rather than a literal release or freedom.
4. **""Lord Kelvin""** - The name is correctly preserved in both translations.
5. **""pidas seda algul""** (thought it at the beginning) - The machine translation captures this idea but with a slightly awkward phrasing, ""even thought it to be a scam at the beginning.""

The machine translation and the reference translation are almost identical, with only a minor formatting difference. The source text in Estonian mentions ""Müncheni julgeolekupoliitika konverents"" (Munich Security Policy Conference), which is directly translated as ""Munich Security Policy Conference"" in both versions. The theme ""Globaalne kriis, globaalsed kohustused"" (Global Crisis, Global Commitments) is also translated the same way in both machine and reference translations.

The only difference is the presence of a comma after ""Conference"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference translation. This is likely a formatting issue and does not affect the meaning of the sentence. The core content of the translation is accurate and consistent with the reference.

|Reference translation: Unexpectedly, senior constable Proot Torim happens to be her model, and he is even prepared to pose a little.|

1. **""Ootamatult satub""** (Unexpectedly arrives) - The machine translation uses ""He is looking forward to becoming"" which is not an accurate representation of the source's sudden arrival. The reference translation captures the unexpected nature with ""Unexpectedly"".

2. **""ta modelliks""** (as a model) - The machine translation has ""modelled on"", which is awkward and does not convey the idea of becoming a model. The reference translation uses ""her model"" which is more direct.

3. **""vanemkonstaabel""** (senior constable) - The machine translation omits this important detail, referring to ""parental convoy"" instead. The reference translation includes ""senior constable"" as ""Proot Torim"".

4. **""kes on valmis""** (who is prepared) - The machine translation adds ""to pose a little"" which is not directly connected to the previous phrase. The reference translation keeps it simple and clear: ""and he is even prepared to pose a little"".

5. **""natuke poseerima""** (to pose a little) - The machine translation includes this phrase, but it is awkwardly connected. The reference translation places it after ""he is even prepared to pose"", making it more natural.

In summary, the machine translation has several issues, including incorrect interpretation of the source's meaning, loss of important details, and awkward phrasing. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text, maintaining the meaning and structure more accurately.

1. **""Teise tsaaririigi"" vs. ""Second Empire"":** The source text refers to ""Teise tsaaririigi,"" which is the Estonian term for ""Second Empire,"" likely referring to a historical period or a specific empire. The machine translation translates this as ""other federal state,"" which is not an accurate representation of the historical context.

2. **""ilmalikku kunsti"" vs. ""secular art"":** The source text uses ""ilmalikku kunsti,"" which means ""secular art"" in Estonian. The machine translation correctly translates this as ""secular art,"" but it omits the adjective ""ilmalikku,"" which is crucial for conveying the type of art being discussed.

3. **Article and Word Order:** The source text starts with ""Säilinud on"" (which means ""has been preserved""), while the machine translation places this phrase at the end, altering the sentence structure. A more accurate translation would maintain the original word order.

In summary, the machine translation loses the historical context and specific term for ""Second Empire"" and omits the adjective ""ilmalikku"" from the phrase, which affects the meaning of the sentence.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: ""Asi on selles, et nagu tööstuseski, võetakse uued vahendid kasutusele siis, kui selleks on vajadus.""
Machine translation: ""The point is that, like industry, new instruments will be mobilised when there is a need to do so.""

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- ""tööstuseski"" (industrial sector) in the source is translated as ""industry"" in the machine translation, which is a direct translation but loses the specific term ""tööstuseski.""
- ""vahendid"" (tools) in the source is translated as ""instruments,"" which is a suitable translation but with a slightly different connotation.
- ""kasutusele"" (into use) in the source is translated as ""mobilised,"" which is a rephrasing but implies a more active process than the passive ""kasutusele.""

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: ""The point is that, like in industry, new tools are adopted when there is a need to do so.""

Step 4: Analyze the differences between the machine and reference translations.
- The reference translation uses ""are adopted"" instead of ""will be mobilised,"" which is a more accurate and natural phrasing in this context.
- The reference translation keeps the term ""in industry"" instead of ""like industry,"" which is a more idiomatic way to express the same idea.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific term for the industrial sector (""tööstuseski"" vs. ""industry"") and the choice of verb (""mobilised"" vs. ""adopted""). The reference translation is more precise and idiomatic, making it of higher quality.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: This light is a source of living water, light full of purity.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""valgus"" (light) but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""protein.""
- The source text describes ""elava vee"" (living water) while the machine translation also refers to ""living water,"" but it attributes it to ""protein,"" which is not accurate.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly translates ""valgus"" as ""light"" and keeps the concept of ""elava vee"" (living water) intact.

Step 6: Analyze the differences
- The main difference is the incorrect identification of ""valgus"" as ""protein"" in the machine translation, which changes the meaning of the original text.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation because it incorrectly translates ""valgus"" as ""protein"" and attributes the concept of living water to protein, whereas the source text clearly refers to light as the subject.

Step 1: Identify the main subject and action
Source: Ka Aristotelese kategooriate uurimine (Research into Aristotle categories)
Machine translation: Research into Aristotle categories
Reference translation: Research into Aristotelian categories

Analysis: The main subject is ""Research into Aristotle categories"" in both translations, but the reference adds the adjective ""Aristotelian"" to provide more specificity.

Step 2: Compare the context and purpose
Source: kuulub metafüüsikasse (belongs to metaphysics)
Machine translation: metaphysical activity
Reference translation: metaphysics

Analysis: The source states that the study belongs to ""metafüüsikasse,"" which is a more direct translation of ""to metaphysics"" than ""activity."" The reference uses ""metaphysics"" without the additional ""activity"" descriptor.

Step 3: Examine the conditional clause
Source: niivõrd kui nende alla kuuluvaid asju uuritakse kui olevaid (as far as the things they contain are studied as they are)
Machine translation: as far as the things they contain are studied as they are
Reference translation: as far as the things they contain are studied as existing

Analysis: The source uses ""kuuluvaid asju uuritakse kui olevaid"" which means ""the things they contain are studied as they are."" The reference omits ""they are"" and uses ""existing"" instead, which is a slightly different but still accurate representation of the original meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is generally accurate, capturing the main subject and the relationship to metaphysics. However, it could be improved by adding the adjective ""Aristotelian"" to the subject and using ""existing"" instead of ""they are"" in the conditional clause to match the reference translation more closely.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the source text
- The machine translation uses ""Every question"" which is a general term, while the source text uses ""Igavesi küsimusi"" which translates to ""eternal questions"" in English. This is a significant difference in meaning.
- The machine translation omits the word ""vastandatakse"" which means ""are answered"" or ""are posed"" in this context, while the reference translation includes it.

3. **""reeturlikeks""**: The source uses the term ""reeturlikeks,"" which means ""thought to be traitorous"" or ""suspected traitors."" The machine translation does not capture this nuance, simply stating ""hostages"" without specifying the reason for their capture.

4. **""peetud""**: The source text implies that the Livonians were being held, but the machine translation omits this aspect, using ""hostages"" without specifying the action.

5. **""Metsepole liivlastelt""**: The source specifies the location and the group from which the hostages were taken (Livonians in Metsepole). The machine translation does not include this detail, making it less specific.

6. **""pantvange""**: The source uses the word ""pantvange,"" which is a more general term for ""hostages"" or ""capture."" The machine translation uses ""hostages,"" which is a direct but less nuanced term.

1. The machine translation has ""However"" at the beginning, which is a direct translation of ""Aga"" in Estonian. This is accurate.
2. ""tundub"" is translated as ""it seems,"" which is a suitable translation for the verb ""tundub.""
3. ""et on üks huvitav juhtum"" is translated as ""that there is an interesting case,"" which captures the meaning of the original phrase.
4. ""millele tuleb teistmoodi läheneda"" is translated as ""that needs to be approached differently,"" which is a correct interpretation of the verb phrase and the need for a different approach.

|im_end| Step 3: Compare with the reference translation|
The machine translation closely matches the reference translation, with only minor differences in punctuation (the reference has no comma after ""However""). The meaning and structure of the sentence are preserved in the machine translation.

|im_end| Conclusion|
The machine translation is of high quality and captures the essence of the source text. The differences are minor and do not significantly affect the meaning. The main difference is the absence of a comma in the machine translation, which is a stylistic choice rather than a mistake. Overall, the translation is accurate and faithful to the original.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: According to folk legends, it was built on the ""foundations of an old monastery"".

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""by the inheritance of the people"" which is not directly present in the source text. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses ""according to folk legends"" which is a more accurate reflection of the source's ""Rahvapärimuse järgi"" (by the folk tradition or legends).
- The machine translation puts the phrase in quotes around ""old monastery,"" while the reference translation does not. This might be a stylistic choice, but the meaning is the same.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the way it expresses the source's reliance on folk traditions or legends, and in the choice to include quotes around ""old monastery."" The core meaning is preserved, but the phrasing and context are not identical. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian text in terms of cultural context and expression.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Kohe pärast valusat kaotust sai Mahler teada oma südamepuudulikkusest.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Immediately after the painful loss, Mahler became aware of his lack of conscience.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Immediately after the painful loss, Mahler was informed of his heart failure.

Step 4: Compare the key phrases and words
- ""valusat kaotust"" (source) vs ""painful loss"" (machine and reference): The source text uses ""valusat kaotust"" which is a more specific term, possibly referring to a personal or emotional loss, while the translations use ""painful loss"" which is a more general term that could apply to any significant loss.
- ""sai teada"" (source) vs ""became aware of"" (machine and reference): Both translations convey the same meaning, but the source uses the passive voice ""sai teada"" (received knowledge), while the translations use the active voice.
- ""oma südamepuudulikkusest"" (source) vs ""his lack of conscience"" (machine) and ""his heart failure"" (reference): The source text specifically mentions ""südamepuudulikkusest"" which translates to ""heart failure"" in the reference translation, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""lack of conscience.""

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- The term ""valusat kaotust"" is translated differently, with the machine translation being more general.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""südamepuudulikkusest"" as ""lack of conscience"" instead of ""heart failure,"" which is the more accurate translation based on the source text.

|Source: Balmorali kruiis toimub Titanicu hukkumise 100. aastapäeva mälestamiseks.|
|Machine translation: On the Limoral Library, the Titanic is taking place to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the death of the Titanic.|
|Reference translation: The Balmoral Cruise is taking place to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""Balmorali kruiis"" (Balmoral cruise), but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""On the Limoral Library,"" which is a location, not a cruise.
2. The event being commemorated is the ""hukkumise"" (sinking) of the Titanic, not its death. The machine translation incorrectly refers to the death, which is a different aspect of the event.
3. The reference translation correctly uses ""The Balmoral Cruise"" and ""the sinking of the Titanic"" to convey the meaning of the source text.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways: it incorrectly identifies the event as taking place at a library instead of a cruise, and it mistakenly focuses on the death rather than the sinking of the Titanic. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning and context of the source text.

|Reference translation: In Bangladesh there were clashes between police and opposition supporters trying to attack the government building.|

|Analysis|
1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same essential information: there were clashes in Bangladesh between police and opposition supporters, and their intention was to attack the government building.
2. The sentence structure is similar in both versions: ""there were clashes"" followed by the participants and their objective.
3. The only difference is the inclusion of ""trying to"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference translation. However, this does not significantly alter the meaning, as it is implied that the clashes were an attempt to attack the building.

Overall, the machine translation is of high quality, with only a minor difference in phrasing that does not affect the clarity or accuracy of the message. The main difference is the optional addition of ""trying to"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference but does not change the core meaning.

|Machine translation: Following the dismantling of the People's Union, the organisation was subordinated to the United Nations in 1946.|
|Reference translation: Following the dismantling of the League of Nations, the organisation was subordinated to the United Nations in 1946.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""Rahvasteliidu"" (People's Union), which is a specific Estonian organization. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""People's Union,"" which is a more general term and does not refer to the historical League of Nations.
2. The reference translation uses ""League of Nations,"" which is the correct historical term for the international organization that preceded the United Nations. The machine translation omits this context, leading to a less accurate translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation because it does not capture the specific historical context of the ""Rahvasteliidu"" (League of Nations) and instead refers to a more general ""People's Union."" This results in a less precise and historically inaccurate translation.

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""The New York Times"" as the author, while the machine translation incorrectly attributes the statement to ""it"" (referring to the Times), which is a grammatical error and a loss of clarity.
2. The source uses the phrase ""oma aja üks taevani ulatuvamaid muusikuid"" which translates to ""one of the most sky-reaching musicians of its time"" in the reference translation. The machine translation simplifies this to ""one of the largest musicians of its time,"" which loses the poetic and elevated connotation of the original.
3. The reference translation uses ""he was"" to refer to Mahler, while the machine translation omits this personal pronoun, making the sentence less clear and impersonal.

1. **Source**: The source text in Estonian mentions ""juurdepääs"" (access) and ""avalikkuse survel"" (under public pressure), which implies that the restoration happened as a result of public demand.

2. **Machine Translation**: The machine translation has ""to public pressure"" as ""public pressure"", which is a correct interpretation of the source. However, it uses ""was restored to"" instead of ""was restored due to"", which changes the meaning slightly.

3. **Reference Translation**: The reference translation uses ""due to"" which is more accurate and conveys the cause-effect relationship between the restoration and public pressure.

4. **Difference**: The main difference is the prepositional phrase ""due to"" in the reference translation, which clarifies the reason for the restoration, while the machine translation uses ""to"" which might imply a destination or recipient of the restoration, rather than the cause.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not entirely incorrect, but it could be improved by using ""due to"" instead of ""to"" to better align with the meaning of the source text. The reference translation more accurately captures the cause-effect relationship between the restoration and public pressure.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: He has a need to make a big apology... Harri Ahvena is suddenly being called on to tear down lead trees.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: He feels the need to make a big apology ... Harri Ahven gets an unexpected call to chop wood for a stove.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""Harri Ahvena is suddenly being called on to tear down lead trees,"" which is a literal interpretation of ""Harri Ahvenat kutsutakse ootamatult pliidipuid raiuma"" and does not capture the intended meaning.
- The reference translation, on the other hand, says ""Harri Ahven gets an unexpected call to chop wood for a stove,"" which conveys the idea of ""raiuma"" (a stove) and implies the act of chopping wood, which is more contextually appropriate.

Step 5: Identify differences
- The machine translation mistranslates ""pliidipuid"" (chopping wood) as ""lead trees,"" which is incorrect.
- The reference translation captures the idea of the unexpected task related to wood for a stove, while the machine translation does not.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it incorrectly translates ""pliidipuid"" as ""lead trees"" and misses the context of the task being related to wood for a stove.

|im_start| Step 5: Analyze differences
1. ""Tagasiteel"" is translated as ""in retrospect"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect. It should be translated as ""on their way back"" to convey the same meaning.
2. ""Ründas neid"" is translated as ""attacked them"" in both, which is accurate.

|im_start|>|im_end|>

Step 1: Compare the subject
- Source: Ristisõdijad (Crusaders)
- Machine translation: Travellers
- Reference translation: The crusaders

The machine translation uses ""Travellers"" instead of ""Ristisõdijad"" (Crusaders), which is a key difference in identifying the subject.

Step 2: Compare the verb and tense
- Source: saabusid (arrived)
- Machine translation: arrived
- Reference translation: arrived

The verb ""saabusid"" in the source text is the past tense of the verb ""to arrive"" in Estonian, which is translated correctly as ""arrived"" in both the machine and reference translations.

Step 3: Compare the destination and date
- Source: Konstantinoopoli alla (in Constantinople)
- Machine translation: Constantinople
- Reference translation: at Constantinople

The machine translation omits ""alla"" (in), which is a preposition that indicates the location. The reference translation includes ""at"" to convey the same meaning.

Step 4: Compare the date
- Source: 1203. aasta 23. juunil (1203, June 23)
- Machine translation: 23 June 1203
- Reference translation: 23 June 1203

The date format is consistent in both the machine and reference translations, but the source includes the year first, while the translations place the date after the day. This is a minor difference in presentation, not a quality issue.

Conclusion:
The machine translation has differences in the subject (using ""Travellers"" instead of ""Crusaders"") and the location (omitting ""in""). However, the verb tense and date are accurately translated. The overall meaning is preserved, but the translation could be improved by using ""The crusaders"" and including ""in"" for better clarity. The reference translation is more idiomatic and contextually accurate, but the machine translation is not significantly off.

- Subject: Jackson
- Action: sõlmis (signed)
- Object: Sonyga (with Sony)
- Purpose: uue plaadilepingu (new record deal)
- Value: rekordilised 65 miljonit dollarit (record USD 65 million)

- Time: Both mention ""March 1991"", which is consistent.
- Subject: ""Jackson"" is present in both.
- Action: ""signed"" is present in both, but ""sõlmis"" in the source is translated to ""signed"" in both.
- Object: ""Sonyi"" in the machine translation is incorrect, it should be ""with Sony"" as in the reference translation.
- Purpose: ""new poster agreement"" in the machine translation is changed to ""new record deal"" in the reference, which is more accurate.
- Value: Both mention ""USD 65 million"" and describe it as a record, but the phrase structure is slightly different.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The main difference is the object description: ""Sonyga uue plaadilepingu"" in the source is translated to ""a new poster agreement"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate. The correct translation should be ""with Sony"" as in the reference, referring to a record deal, not a poster agreement.
- The reference translation also clarifies the type of deal by specifying ""record deal"", which is a more precise term than ""poster agreement.""

|Reference translation: In Volgograd , Russia , there was a powerful gas explosion in an apartment building , which caused the building to partially collapse .|

1. **Citation of location**: The source text mentions ""Venemaal"" (Estonian for ""in the city of Volgograd""), while the machine translation and reference translation both use ""Volgograd, Russia"". The machine translation is correct in this aspect, but it could be more precise by specifying ""in the city of"" or using the country name.

2. **Type of building**: The source text uses ""kortermajas"" (Estonian for ""corterhouse""), which is a less common term in English. The machine translation translates it as ""corterhouse,"" which is likely a typo or an incorrect term. The reference translation uses ""apartment building,"" which is a more accurate and common term in English.

3. **Partial collapse**: Both the machine translation and the reference translation correctly convey that the building partially collapsed.

4. **Sentence structure**: The source text has a slightly different sentence structure, with ""mille tõttu"" (Estonian for ""because of which"") connecting the explosion to the collapse. The machine translation and reference translation rephrase this as ""which caused,"" which is a common way to express the same idea in English.

In summary, the machine translation has issues with the less common term ""corterhouse"" and may have a typo, but overall, it conveys the main points of the event. The reference translation is more accurate in terms of specifying ""apartment building"" and has a slightly different phrasing, but both translations capture the essence of the event.

3. The reference translation adds the context ""At the shoot"" to clarify when the meeting took place, which is not present in the machine translation.

|im_end| Conclusion: The machine translation has differences in terms of proper name (Quincy Jones vs Qucy Jong), the level of involvement (dealing with vs being responsible), and the context of the meeting (omitted in the machine translation). The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually complete translation.

|Source: Kolmikpunkti Rwanda ja Tansaaniaga määravad Mwibu ja Kagera jõe voolunõvad.| |Machine translation: The three points with Rwanda and Tanzania will be determined by the flows of the Mwibu and the Kagera River.| |Reference translation: The triple point with Rwanda and Tanzania is determined by the flow beds of the Mwibu and the Kagera rivers.| 

|Analysis|
1. **""Kolmikpunkti"" vs ""The three points"":** The source uses ""Kolmikpunkti"" which refers to a specific point in geography where three rivers meet, while the machine translation translates it as ""The three points,"" which is a more general term and might not convey the specific meaning of a triple point.
2. **""määravad"" vs ""will be determined"":** The source uses the present tense ""määravad"" (determine), while the machine translation uses the future tense ""will be determined."" The reference translation uses ""is determined,"" which is in the present tense, similar to the source.
3. **""Mwibu ja Kagera jõe voolunõud"" vs ""flows of the Mwibu and the Kagera River"":** The source uses ""voolunõud"" (flow needs), which might be a less common or literal translation of the river flows. The machine translation translates it as ""flows of the Mwibu and the Kagera River,"" which is a more direct and accurate translation of the concept.
4. **""jõe voolunõvad"" vs ""flow beds"":** The source uses ""jõe voolunõvad,"" which could be a typo or a less common term for the riverbeds where the flow meets. The reference translation uses ""flow beds,"" which is a more standard term for this context.

In summary, the machine translation has some differences in terms of specificity (triple point vs three points) and choice of words (flow needs vs flow beds). The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the specific meaning of the source text, particularly in the context of a triple point determined by riverbeds.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Normannide vallutusretk Londonisse ei avaldunud mitte ainult läbi uue valitseva klassi, vaid ka linna struktuuris.
Machine translation: The conquest of the Normans to London was not only revealed through the new ruling class, but also through the city structure.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- ""Normannide vallutusretk Londonisse"" (Normanns' conquest to London) is translated as ""The conquest of the Normans to London"", which omits the genitive case ""Normannide"" and adds ""to"" instead of ""to London"".
- ""ei avaldunud"" (did not manifest) is translated as ""was not only revealed"", which changes the verb and adds the passive voice.
- ""mitte ainult läbi uue valitseva klassi"" (not only through the new ruling class) is translated as ""not only through the new ruling class"", which is accurate but omits the word ""lääbimise"" (passing through) from the source.
- ""vaid ka linna struktuuris"" (but also in the city's structure) is translated as ""but also through the city structure"", which omits the genitive case ""linna"" (city's) but keeps the meaning.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: The conquest of London by the Normans was not only reflected in the new ruling class, but also through the city 's structure.

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The genitive case ""Normannide"" is missing in the machine translation, which affects the clarity of the subject.
- The passive voice in the machine translation is not present in the reference, making it sound more active.
- The reference translation uses ""reflected"" instead of ""revealed"", which might convey a slightly different nuance but is still accurate.
- The genitive case ""linna"" is missing in the machine translation, which should be ""city's"" to properly indicate possession.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some differences in terms of case marking, verb choice, and passive voice, which affect the clarity and accuracy of the translation. The reference translation is more precise in these aspects, particularly with the genitive case and the passive voice.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- The source text mentions ""Ministri määrusega"" (by the ministerial decree), which is a specific reference to a type of regulation. The machine translation translates this as ""by the ministerial regulation,"" which conveys a similar meaning but omits the word ""määrusega"" (decree).
- The rest of the sentence structure is preserved in both the source and machine translation, with ""koostöö päästeteenistuse, politsei ja häirekeskuse vahel"" (cooperation between the rescue service, police, and alert centre).

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the inclusion of the word ""a"" before ""ministerial regulation"" in the reference. This is a minor grammatical difference, as ""by the ministerial regulation"" is still clear in both translations.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the use of ""a"" before ""ministerial regulation"" in the reference translation. The core meaning of the source text is preserved, and the structure is similar. The main difference is the omission of the word ""määrusega"" in the machine translation, which could be considered a loss of precision but does not significantly alter the meaning. Overall, the quality of the translation is good, but there is room for improvement in terms of precision.

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""finantskriisis vaevlevale Palestiina Omavalitsusele"" which translates to ""the Palestinian Authority suffering from a financial crisis"" in the reference translation. The machine translation omits the phrase ""suffering from a financial crisis"" and instead uses ""in the midst of the financial crisis"", which is a similar but less vivid expression.
2. The source text uses ""jõudsid kokkuleppele"" which means ""reached an agreement"" or ""agreed to"", while the machine translation directly translates this as ""have agreed"". The meaning is the same, but the source text's phrasing is not preserved.
3. The rest of the sentence structure is preserved relatively well in the machine translation, with proper subject-verb-object order.

Overall, the machine translation captures the main idea but loses some nuance by not including the phrase ""suffering from a financial crisis"" and slightly altering the phrasing of the agreement.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Osmo fatalismi alused olid ainult loogilised ja epistemoloogilised.
Machine translation: The only logical and episoological bases of the Oma Typhoon were.

Step 2: Identify differences in word order and structure.
In the source text, ""Osmo fatalismi alused"" (the foundations of Osmo's fatalism) is the subject, followed by ""olid ainult"" (were only), and then ""loogilised ja epistemoloogilised"" (logical and epistemological). The machine translation, however, has ""The only logical and episoological bases"" as the subject, which is a different structure.

Step 3: Analyze the translation of ""alused"" (foundations) and ""ainult"" (only).
""Alused"" is translated as ""bases"" in the machine translation, which is a correct translation but placed before ""logical and episoological,"" which is not accurate. ""Ainult"" is translated as ""the only,"" which is also correct but should be placed after ""bases"" to maintain the correct emphasis on the exclusivity.

Step 4: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: The foundations of Osmo's fatalism were only logical and epistemological.

Step 5: Conclusion.
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of word order and structure. It incorrectly places ""the only"" before ""bases"" and omits the possessive form ""Osmo's"" in ""Osmo's fatalism."" The correct translation should be: ""The foundations of Osmo's fatalism were only logical and epistemological.""

1. **Source analysis**: The source text is in Estonian and refers to ""pisi"" which is likely a misspelling or a typo, as it seems to be the Estonian word for ""Lake Tanganjika"" (corrected in the reference translation). The source also mentions ""Tanganjika järv"" which is the correct name of the lake.

2. **Machine translation analysis**: The machine translation mistranslates ""pisi"" as ""Little"" and ""Tanganjika järv"" as ""The Lake of Tanzine."" This is a significant error, as ""Little"" does not convey the intended meaning and ""The Lake of Tanzine"" is not a proper translation of the lake's name.

3. **Reference translation analysis**: The reference translation accurately translates ""pisi"" as ""Lake Tanganjika"" and maintains the correct context and meaning.

4. **Comparison**: The machine translation fails to capture the correct name of the lake and uses an inappropriate adjective, which reduces the quality of the translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more faithful to the source text.

In conclusion, the machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the name of the lake and the choice of words. The quality of the translation could be improved by using the correct name and a more accurate adjective to describe the lake's importance.

|Reference translation: From the front pages of Estonian newspapers the news about the fighting over the fate of the carpets even reached the press in Riga and St. Petersburg.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Sõda vaipade saatuse üle""** (war over carpets) - The machine translation omits the context of ""vaipade saatuse"" (carpet fate), which is crucial for understanding the topic.
2. **""jõudis""** (reached) - The verb is translated correctly, but the source text uses a more specific term for news reaching the press, which is not captured in the machine translation.
3. **""Tallinna ajalehtede esikülgedelt""** (from the front pages of Tallinn's newspapers) - The source location is translated accurately, but the machine translation omits the possessive ""Tallinna"" and the word ""esikülgedelt"" (front pages).
4. **""isegi""** (even) - This intensifier is missing in the machine translation, which weakens the emphasis on the extent of the news coverage.
5. **""Riia ja Peterburi ajakirjandusse""** (Riga and St Petersburg press) - The translation is correct, but the machine omits the genitive case for ""Riia"" and ""Peterburi"" (Riga's and St. Petersburg's).

In summary, the machine translation loses important context about the topic (carpet fate) and omits specific details like the possessive and intensifier, which affects the overall meaning and quality of the translation.

1. **Reading the source text**: The source text states that an unidentified person in Seattle, Washington, USA, left 6 people injured and then committed suicide.

2. **Comparing with machine translation**: The machine translation says that the person ""beaten"" 6 people, which is not accurate. The source text uses the word ""lasi siiani identifitseerimata"" (left unidentified), suggesting that the person's identity was unknown, not that they physically beat the people.

3. **Comparing with reference translation**: The reference translation correctly translates ""lasi siiani identifitseerimata"" as ""shot"" (which implies an act of violence), and also specifies that it was at a party, which is not mentioned in the source text but is a reasonable assumption based on context.

4. **Error analysis**: The machine translation mistakes ""lasi siiani identifitseerimata"" as ""beaten,"" which changes the nature of the event from a violent act to a physical altercation. The reference translation captures the correct meaning by translating it as ""shot"" and adds the context of a party.

5. **Overall evaluation**: The machine translation is of lower quality due to the incorrect interpretation of the source text, specifically regarding the method of injuring the people. The reference translation is more accurate and provides additional context.

2. **Difference 1**: The machine translation uses ""antigentic shift"" instead of ""antigeense nihke käigus"" (which means ""in the process of an antigenic shift""). The reference translation is more accurate in this context, as ""antigentic shift"" is a more common term in English.

3. **Difference 2**: The machine translation uses ""a new type of virus immunisation"" while the reference translation uses ""immunity against a new type of the virus."" The reference is clearer, as it specifies that it's immunity against the new virus, not just immunisation.

4. **Difference 3**: The reference translation omits the word ""puudub"" (which means ""lacks"" or ""is missing"") before ""suurel hulgas inimestel,"" making the sentence flow more naturally in English.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- In the source, ""rahandusminister"" is translated as ""Finance Minister"" (correct).

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there is a minor difference in the title of the deputy, which is ""asekantsler"" in Estonian and ""Deputy Secretary-General"" in the reference. This difference affects the level of formality and standardization of the translation. Overall, the meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is more precise in this context.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Identify the main subject and action in the source text.
In the source text, the main subject is ""Seltsingud"" (fellowships) and the action is ""liigituvad"" (are categorised). The context is about categorizing fellowships into internal and external types.

Step 2: Compare the subject in the machine translation and the reference translation.
Machine translation: "" Declarations""
Reference translation: ""Fellowships""

The subject in the machine translation is "" Declarations,"" which is not the correct term for the Estonian context, as it refers to legal or formal statements rather than the fellowships being discussed.

Step 3: Compare the action and categorization terms.
Machine translation: ""as internal and external undertakings""
Reference translation: ""as internal and external fellowships""

The action and categorization terms in the machine translation are ""undertakings,"" which is not specific to the context of fellowships. The reference translation uses ""fellowships"" to maintain the context.

Step 4: Analyze the overall meaning and coherence.
The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text, as it replaces the subject ""Seltsingud"" with "" Declarations"" and uses a more general term ""undertakings"" instead of specifying ""fellowships."" The reference translation, on the other hand, maintains the subject and context.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation because it incorrectly translates the subject and uses a less specific term for the categorization. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the original Estonian text.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""On kerge aru saada, miks armastaja tahab anda armastatule kõik või vähemalt valib ideaalile äratuntavalt lähedase, kuid vähem nõudliku käitumismustri.""
- Machine translation: ""It is easy to understand why a loving person wants to give everyone loved, or at least wants to choose a culture of behaviour that is recognisably close to the ideal but less demanding.""

Difference 1: The machine translation uses ""everyone loved"" instead of ""armastatule kõik"" (the loved one). This is a direct translation error.

Difference 2: The machine translation says ""a culture of behaviour"" instead of ""käitumismustri"" (pattern of behavior). This is a change in meaning, as ""käitumismustri"" specifically refers to a pattern, while ""culture"" could imply a broader context.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""It is easy to understand why a loving person wants to give everyone loved, or at least wants to choose a culture of behaviour that is recognisably close to the ideal but less demanding.""
- Reference translation: ""It is easy to understand why a lover wants to give everything to the loved one, or at least wants to choose a pattern of behaviour that is recognisably close to the ideal but less demanding.""

Difference 3: The reference translation uses ""the loved one"" (reflected in ""armastatule kõik"" in the source) instead of ""everyone loved,"" which is more accurate.

Conclusion: The machine translation has several differences from the reference translation, including a direct translation error in referring to ""armastatule kõik"" as ""everyone loved"" and a change in meaning from ""käitumismustri"" to ""a culture of behavior."" The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the essence of the source text.

Step 1: Compare the structure and grammar
- Source: ""Lahknevust ei talutud, korruptsioon oli kõrgeim, samas kui avalik moraal oli madalaim.""
- Machine translation: ""Divergence was not tolerated, corruption was the highest, while public morals were the lowest.""
- Reference translation: ""Divergence was not tolerated, corruption was at the highest, while public morals were at their lowest.""

The structure and grammar in the machine translation are similar to the reference translation, with the exception of ""the lowest"" in the MT, which is replaced with ""the lowest"" in the reference. This is a minor difference in phrasing.

Step 2: Check for accuracy of key terms
- ""Lahknevust"" (divergence) is translated accurately in both MT and Ref.
- ""korruptsioon"" (corruption) is translated as ""corruption"" in both, which is correct.
- ""kõrgeim"" (highest) and ""madalaim"" (lowest) are translated as ""the highest"" and ""the lowest"" respectively, which is accurate.

Step 3: Evaluate the preservation of meaning
- The meaning of the source text is preserved in both translations, with the main points about divergence not being tolerated, high corruption, and low public morals conveyed.

Step 4: Analyze the difference in phrasing
- The main difference is the use of ""the lowest"" in the MT, which is more formal and precise than ""lowest"" in the reference. However, both convey the same meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality overall, with only a minor difference in phrasing that does not affect the meaning. The key points are accurately translated, and the structure is similar to the reference. The main difference is a stylistic choice, which is generally acceptable.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: ""igaüks valitsejatest"" (Each of the rulers)
Machine translation: ""The Taliban used to take up seven power"" (This is a misinterpretation, as ""valitsejatest"" refers to rulers, not the Taliban)

Step 2: Identify the difference.
The machine translation incorrectly assumes that ""valitsejatest"" refers to the Taliban, while the source text is more general and could apply to any rulers.

Step 3: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
Source: ""iga jõud tegi endale kuus inglit"" (every power made six angels)
Reference translation: ""and every power made six angels"" (This is a direct translation)

Step 4: Analyze the difference.
The machine translation omits the word ""endale"" (for itself) in the sentence, which is crucial for understanding the action of each power.

Step 5: Compare the final part of the source text.
Source: ""kuni ingleid sai 365"" (until they got 365)
Machine translation: ""until they got 365"" (This is a direct translation)

Step 6: Identify the difference.
The machine translation is accurate in this part.

Conclusion:
The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the first part where it incorrectly attributes the actions to the Taliban instead of generic rulers. Additionally, it omits the word ""endale"" in the second part, which affects the clarity of the action. The final part is accurate, but the overall quality of the translation is poor due to these errors.

|Reference translation: Then the bodies of Mussolini , his mistress and some 15 more fascists were taken to Milan , where they were publicly displayed.| (English Reference)

Analysis:

1. **Subject and verb**: The source text mentions ""Mussolini, tema armukese"" (Mussolini and his mistress), while the machine translation combines them into ""Mussolini, his mercy"", which is a misinterpretation. The reference translation correctly separates them as ""the bodies of Mussolini, his mistress"".

2. **Location**: The source text uses ""Milanosse"" (a form of ""Milan"" in Estonian), but the machine translation incorrectly adds an extra ""s"" to create ""Milanoss"", which is not a valid word. The reference translation correctly uses ""Milan"".

3. **Action**: The source text uses ""näidati"" (displayed), while the machine translation translates it as ""demonstrated"", which is not entirely accurate as ""näidati"" implies a more passive and public showing of the bodies, whereas ""demonstrated"" could suggest a more active event. The reference translation uses ""displayed"", which is a more suitable term.

4. **Sentence structure**: The source text has a more natural flow, with ""Seejärel viidi"" (Then they were taken) followed by the details. The machine translation combines these elements, making the sentence less clear. The reference translation maintains a similar structure.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of combining Mussolini and his mistress into a single entity, using an incorrect location, and potentially altering the meaning of the action by using ""demonstrated"" instead of ""displayed"". The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the original Estonian text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: In clashes, more than ten civilians died and were injured.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In clashes, ten civilians were killed and more than ten were injured.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""more than ten civilians died and were injured"" while the reference translation separates the two actions, saying ""ten civilians were killed"" and ""more than ten were injured.""
- The word order in the machine translation is slightly different, placing ""more than ten"" after both actions, whereas the reference translation places it after ""were injured.""

Step 5: Analyze the quality
The machine translation is not entirely accurate in terms of conveying the original meaning. It combines the two separate events (killing and injuring) into one sentence, which might lead to confusion about the exact number of casualties. The reference translation clearly distinguishes between the two and provides a clearer picture of the situation.

Conclusion: The machine translation could be improved by separating the two events and maintaining the original word order, similar to the reference translation: ""In clashes, ten civilians were killed and more than ten were injured.""

- Machine translation: ""In a conflict situation, it would be more desirable to join a tactic with one side against the other, rather than attacking both at the same time.""

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but there are a few differences:

1. The source uses ""oleks oodatavam"" (more desirable), while the machine translation uses ""it would be more desirable."" The meaning is similar, but the word order is slightly different.
2. The source uses ""liituda ühe osapoolega teise vastu"" (to join with one side against the other), which is translated as ""join a tactic with one side against the other."" The translation is accurate, but the word ""tactic"" is not present in the source, so it's inferred.
3. The source has ""mitte mõlemat korraga rünnata"" (not to attack both at the same time), while the machine translation has ""rather than attacking both at the same time."" The meaning is the same, but the structure is slightly different.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""In a conflict situation, it would be more desirable to join a tactic with one side against the other, rather than attacking both at the same time.""
- Reference translation: ""In a conflict situation, the more expected tactic would be to join with one side against the other, rather than attack both at the same time.""

|Machine translation: This philosophy cannot be built on mere concepts, but requires the closest interaction with historical cultural sciences.|
|Reference translation: Philosophy cannot create this from mere concepts, but requires the closest interaction with historical cultural sciences.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Filosoofia ei saa seda luua""** (Machine: ""This philosophy cannot be built"") - Both translations convey the idea that philosophy cannot solely rely on concepts to be formed or created. The difference is minor, as ""create"" in the reference is slightly more general, but the meaning is consistent.

2. **""paljastest mõistetest""** (Machine: ""mere concepts"") - The source text uses ""paljastest"" which means ""from many"" or ""various"" concepts, while the machine translation uses ""mere,"" which means ""only"" or ""simple."" The reference translation captures the original meaning by using ""mere concepts,"" but it omits the ""paljastest"" part, which might be a loss of nuance.

3. **""vaid vajab""** (Machine: ""but requires"") - Both translations convey the need for something, but the machine translation uses ""requires"" which is a more formal and direct term, while the reference uses ""but requires"" which is slightly more conversational. The meaning is the same.

4. **""kõige tihedamat kokkupuudet""** (Machine: ""the closest interaction"") - The source text uses ""kõige tihedamat"" to emphasize the intensity of the connection, which is translated as ""the closest"" in both machine and reference translations. The meaning is preserved.

5. **""ajalooliste kultuuriteadustega""** (Machine: ""with historical cultural sciences"") - Both translations correctly translate this phrase, maintaining the connection to historical cultural studies.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is generally accurate, but it loses some nuance in the source text, particularly in the phrase ""paljastest mõistetest."" The reference translation captures the essence of the source while making a few minor adjustments for clarity and style.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Kant väidab, et siis me tajume neid alati ruumilisi omadusi omavatena.
Machine translation: Kant claims that we will then always perceive them as having spatial characteristics.

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, stating that Kant makes a claim about our perception of something having spatial characteristics. However, there are a few differences:

1. The source text includes the word ""väidab"" (claims), which is translated as ""claims"" in the reference translation. Both convey the same meaning, but the word choice is slightly different.
2. The source text has ""et siis"" (that then), which is not directly translated in the machine translation but can be inferred from the context. It indicates a temporal aspect, suggesting that the perception occurs after a certain point.
3. The source text ends with ""omavatena,"" which is a grammatical construction that implies the possession of spatial characteristics. The machine translation omits this part, but it's not crucial for understanding the main point.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: Kant claims that we will then always perceive them as having spatial characteristics.
Reference translation: Kant claims that we will then always perceive them as having spatial characteristics.

The reference translation is nearly identical to the machine translation, with only a minor difference: the reference translation omits the word ""as"" after ""perceive them."" This is a stylistic choice and does not change the meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, capturing the essence of the source text. The differences are minor and do not significantly alter the meaning. The main issue is the omission of the word ""as"" in the reference translation, which is a matter of style rather than a substantial error.

Source: Kõikidel juhtudel ilmus uus teooria alles pärast normaalteadusliku peamurdmisülesannete lahendamise selget läbikukkumist.
Machine translation: In all cases, new theory emerged only after a clear failure to resolve normal scientific breaking tasks.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- ""peamurdmisülesannete"" (major achievement tasks) in the source is translated as ""breaking tasks"" in the machine translation, which might not convey the same meaning. ""Peamurdmisülesanne"" refers to a significant or major task, while ""breaking tasks"" could imply tasks that involve breaking something, which is not the intended context.
- ""selget läbikukkumist"" (clear failure) in the source is translated as ""clear failure to resolve"" in the machine translation, which is a similar expression but omits the word ""puzzle"" that is present in the reference translation.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: In all cases, new theory emerged only after a clear failure to resolve normal scientific breaking tasks.
Reference translation: In all cases, new theory emerged only after a clear failure to resolve a normal scientific puzzle.

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The machine translation uses ""breaking tasks"" instead of ""puzzle,"" which changes the nature of the challenge being described. A puzzle is more fitting in the context of a scientific problem, while ""breaking tasks"" might suggest a more physical or action-oriented context.
- The reference translation includes the word ""puzzle"" that is missing in the machine translation, which helps convey the idea of a mental challenge or problem to be solved.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the choice of words ""peamurdmisülesannete"" (translated as ""breaking tasks"") and the absence of the word ""puzzle."" The reference translation better captures the essence of the source text by using ""puzzle"" to describe the scientific challenge, while the machine translation might lead to a less accurate understanding of the context.

Machine translation: After the Second World War, the United Nations designated it as the Belgian maintenance territory to prepare for its independence.
Reference translation: After the Second World War, the United Nations designated it as the Belgian custodial territory to prepare for the country's independence.

The main difference lies in the term ""hooldusterritooriumiks"" (maintenance territory) vs. ""custodial territory"" in the reference translation. The choice of ""custodial"" is more suitable in this context, as it implies a more active role in overseeing the country's transition to independence.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the choice of ""maintenance territory"" instead of ""custodial territory,"" which affects the meaning of the supervision or control the United Nations had over the area. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the original source text in terms of the nature of the territory's role.

2. **Machine translation**: During her time Portugal covered about half of its current territory.
   - Subject: During her time (matches source, but gender is not specified)
   - Main verb: covered (matches source)
   - Object: about half of its current territory (matches source, but ""her"" is not accurate)

3. **Reference translation**: During his rule, Portugal covered about half of its current territory.
   - Subject: During his rule (matches source, but gender is changed to masculine)
   - Main verb: covered (matches source)
   - Object: about half of its current territory (matches source)

**Analysis**: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a few ways:
- The gender of the subject is not specified in the machine translation, which could be either masculine or feminine, while the reference translation specifies ""his"" for a male ruler.
- The machine translation uses ""her"" instead of ""his"" or ""its"" to refer to Portugal, which is not accurate as it could be interpreted as a female entity.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should be adjusted to:
- Specify the gender of the subject, either as ""During his time"" (masculine) or ""During her time"" (feminine), based on the context.
- Use ""its"" instead of ""her"" to correctly refer to Portugal as a country.

Final evaluation: The machine translation is of moderate quality, with some errors in gender and pronoun usage. It would be improved by making the necessary adjustments to the subject and pronoun choice.

Machine translation: Officials began to pay a higher salary to reduce the temptation of bribery.
|im_end|

Analysis:
1. The verb ""hakati"" in the source text, which means ""received"" or ""was given"" in Estonian, is translated as ""pay"" in the machine translation. This is a mistake, as the subject (ametnikud, or officials) should be receiving the higher salary, not paying it.
2. The word ""maksma"" in the machine translation is a typo or incorrect, as it should be ""maksma"" (payment) in the context of receiving a salary, not paying a salary.
3. The phrase ""altkäemaksu võtmise kiusatust"" (the temptation of bribe-taking) is translated correctly, but the verb ""vähendada"" (to reduce) is placed before it in the machine translation, while in the reference translation, it follows the subject ""maksma suuremat palka"" (higher salary). The correct structure in English is to place the purpose (to reduce the temptation) after the action (receiving the higher salary).

Corrected machine translation: Officials began to receive a higher salary to reduce the temptation of bribery.

1. **Source text**: ""Kui ta ei peaks oma armastavat pühendumist instrumentaalselt väärtuslikuks armastatule head tegevana, siis ei oleks see talle seesmiselt väärtuslik.""
   - Machine translation: ""If it did not consider its loving commitment to an ideally loved one as a good reality, it would not be worthy of it internally.""
   - Reference translation: ""If he did not consider his loving commitment to the loved one, who has been made instrumentally valuable by love, as doing good, it would have no internal value for him.""

2. **Difference 1**: The machine translation omits the phrase ""who has been made instrumentally valuable by love"" which is crucial for understanding the context. This phrase clarifies that the commitment is to a specific person whose value is derived from the love, not just an ideally loved one in general.

3. **Difference 2**: The machine translation uses ""good reality"" instead of ""doing good."" The reference translation is more accurate in conveying the idea that the loving commitment is seen as a positive action or deed.

4. **Difference 3**: The reference translation adds ""for him"" at the end, which is not present in the machine translation but emphasizes that the lack of internal value is a personal perspective.

In summary, the machine translation loses important context and nuances, particularly in specifying the instrumentally valuable nature of the loved one and the action being evaluated. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the original Estonian text.

1. **Subject and verb**: In the source text, ""Evelin tuleb"" (Evelin comes) is the subject and verb, while in the machine translation, ""I have come"" is used. The reference translation correctly uses ""Evelin comes"" to maintain the subject and tense.

2. **Prepositional phrase**: The source text includes ""juurde häid ja halbu uudiseid"" (to Georg with good and bad news), which is translated as ""to Georg"" in both machine and reference translations. However, the reference translation omits the ""with"" part, which is common in English when the news is the focus.

3. **Tone and structure**: The source text uses the future tense ""tuleb"" (comes) to indicate an action that is about to happen. The machine translation uses the present tense ""have come,"" which might imply a completed action, while the reference translation keeps the future tense.

4. **Omission of personal pronoun**: The machine translation includes ""I"" as the subject, which is unnecessary and not present in the source or reference translations.

5. **Sentence structure**: The source text places the action (reporting news) before the destination (Georg), while the machine translation reverses the order. The reference translation follows the source's structure.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of tense, the unnecessary use of ""I"", and the structure of the sentence. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian text in terms of subject, verb, and the focus on the news.

Reference translation: ""the discriminating party"" and ""admits""

Step 2: Compare the subject

Step 4: Analyze the difference
The machine translation is singular, which might be a misinterpretation of the source's plural ""juhul"" (case). The reference translation correctly uses ""their"" to refer to a group or the general case. Additionally, the reference translation includes ""party"" to provide a more natural English equivalent for ""juhul"" (case).

Final analysis: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the subject (""discriminatory"" vs. ""the discriminating party"") and the verb agreement (""her reason"" vs. ""their reason"").

|Analysis:|
1. **""Saksimaa vahetas pooli""** (Saxony changed sides) - Machine translation: ""The Saxony changed the parties"" - The machine translation is not accurate here, as ""pooli"" refers to sides or alliances, not political parties. The correct translation should be ""changed sides.""

The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly in line with each other, with only a slight difference in the phrasing. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. Both translations convey the same source text information: the influence of Bruckner and Wagner is present, and there are elements that Deryck Cooke refers to as ""pure Mahler.""
2. The structure of the sentences is similar: ""In others, the influence is felt"" vs. ""In the work, the influence can be felt.""
3. The mention of ""musical scientist Deryck Cooke"" is consistent in both translations.
4. The key phrase ""elemente, mida ta nimetab 'puhtaks Mahleriks'"" is translated as ""elements that he calls 'pure Mahler'"" in both, which is a direct translation.

The only difference is the addition of ""can be"" in the reference translation, which is not present in the machine translation. This addition is not significant, as it is a common way to express the possibility of experiencing the influence in a work, but it does not change the overall meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is of good quality, with only a minor variation in the choice of words. The meaning is accurately conveyed, and the differences are minor enough not to affect the comprehension significantly.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The Mongolian Parliament elected Chimed Saikhanbileg as the country 's new Prime Minister.

Step 4: Compare the names
In the source text, the name is ""Tšimedijn Saihhanbilegi,"" while in the machine translation, it is ""Chile medijn Saihhanbiu."" The reference translation has the correct name, ""Chimed Saikhanbileg.""

Step 5: Compare the titles and positions
The source text mentions ""riigi uueks peaministriks"" (new Prime Minister of the country), which is correctly translated as ""the country's new Prime Minister"" in the reference translation. The machine translation, however, incorrectly uses ""its new Prime Minister"" instead of specifying the country.

Step 6: Analyze the differences
The main differences are:
1. Incorrect name: ""Tšimedijn Saihhanbilegi"" should be ""Chimed Saikhanbileg.""
2. Lack of country specification in the machine translation: ""its new Prime Minister"" instead of ""the country's new Prime Minister.""

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Horvaatias astus tagasi välisminister Davor Ivo Stier.
Translation context: This sentence is about a Croatian politician, Davor Ivo Stier, who has returned or stepped down as the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Estonia.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
Machine translation: In Croatia, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Davor Ivo Stier, withdrew.
Reference translation: In Croatia, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Davor Ivo Stier, resigned.

Difference analysis:
- ""Horvaatias"" (Estonian) vs ""In Croatia"" (English): The source text specifies the country as ""Horvaatias"" which is likely a typo or a misinterpretation, as it should be ""Croatia"" in English.
- ""astus tagasi"" (Estonian) vs ""withdrew"" (English): The machine translation uses ""withdrew,"" which implies a more general action of leaving a position, while the reference translation uses ""resigned,"" which specifically means leaving a post due to resignation, typically a voluntary act.
- ""välisminister"" (Estonian) vs ""Minister for Foreign Affairs"" (English): Both convey the same meaning, but the machine translation correctly translates this title.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation has a few differences from the reference translation. The country name is incorrect, and the verb ""astus tagasi"" is translated as ""withdrew,"" which is not as specific as ""resigned"" in the reference. The title ""välisminister"" is accurately translated. Overall, the quality of the translation could be improved by fixing the country name and using the more precise term ""resigned"" instead of ""withdrew.""

|Reference translation: Similar to the frescoes in Bojana Church, Rila St. John shows realism and non-canonical design.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Sarnaselt""** (Machine: ""Like the"", Reference: ""Similar to"") - The machine translation uses ""Like the"" which is a direct translation but not as idiomatic as ""Similar to"" in English, which implies comparison.
2. **""Bojana kiriku freskodega""** (Machine: ""Bojana Church's sham bags"") - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""freskodega"" (with frescoes) as ""sham bags"", which is a misunderstanding. The frescoes are the subject of comparison, not bags.
3. **""näitab""** (Machine: ""is showing"") - The machine translation uses ""is showing"" which is a bit awkward, while the reference translation uses ""shows"" which is more natural and accurate.
4. **""Rila Püha Johannes""** (Machine: ""Rila Pincreasingly Johannes"") - The machine translation incorrectly adds ""Pincreasingly"" which is not in the source text. The correct name is ""Rila St. John"" as in the reference translation.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation uses ""Khowt"" instead of ""Khowst"". This is a significant error, as ""Khowt"" is not a correct translation of the source's ""Khowsti"" or the reference's ""Khowst"". The correct name of the city is ""Khowst"" without the ""t"" at the end.

Overall, the machine translation has a significant error in the city name, which affects the meaning and accuracy of the translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text, with only a minor difference in capitalization.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Politseioperatsiooni käigus sai surma 7 kinnipeetavat.
Machine translation: 7 detainees were killed during a police operation.

Step 2: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- ""Politseioperatsiooni käigus"" (During a police operation)
- ""sai surma"" (got killed)
- ""7 kinnipeetavat"" (7 detainees)

Step 3: Compare the key phrases and words in the machine translation.
- ""7 detainees were killed"" (matches ""sai surma"" and ""7 kinnipeetavat"")
- ""during a police operation"" (matches ""Politseioperatsiooni käigus"")

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text, with the key information about the number of detainees, the event of their death, and the context of a police operation.

Step 5: Conclusion.
The machine translation is of high quality and closely aligns with the reference translation. The only difference is the formatting, where the reference translation omits the word ""operation"" after ""police,"" but this is a minor detail that does not affect the overall meaning. The translation is faithful to the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

1. **Source analysis**: The source text is in Estonian and describes a traditional activity, specifically that Pols (which likely refers to a folk dance or a type of dance) is danced with regular accompaniment from a violin or accordion.

2. **Machine translation analysis**: The machine translation attempts to convey the idea but makes several errors. First, ""Polsi"" is translated as ""The Pols,"" which is likely a misinterpretation or incorrect word choice. Second, ""tantsitakse"" (is danced) is translated as ""will be danced,"" which suggests a future tense, but the original text does not imply a future action. Third, ""tavalise viiuli või lõõtspilli saatel"" (with regular violin or accordion accompaniment) is translated as ""on the routine sign or on the loop cloud,"" which is a nonsensical combination of words, with ""routine sign"" not being a suitable translation for ""tavalise viiuli"" and ""loop cloud"" being a literal but incorrect translation of ""lõõtspilli saatel.""

3. **Reference translation analysis**: The reference translation accurately captures the meaning, using ""with regular violin or accordion accompaniment"" to describe the musical accompaniment for Pols.

4. **Comparison**: The machine translation fails to convey the cultural context and the specific meaning of the source text, while the reference translation maintains the correct meaning and tone.

5. **Evaluation**: The quality of the machine translation is low due to inaccuracies in word choice, tense, and cultural understanding. The reference translation is the more accurate and faithful representation of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Identify the key elements in the source text
- ""sajandist pärit"" (from the era)
- ""miniatuurid"" (miniatures)
- ""Bütsantsi kunsti"" (Butsantsi art)
- ""abstraktsust ja sümboolset tähendust"" (abstraction and symbolic meaning)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""miniatures"" is correct, but it omits ""from the era"" (sajandist pärit) and replaces ""Butsantsi"" with ""Butsants Art"" (which is not accurate, as it should be ""Byzantine"" to match the reference).
- Reference translation: ""miniatures express the abstraction and symbolic significance of Byzantine art"" captures the essence of the source, including the correct art movement (Byzantine) and the context (from the era).

Step 3: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation is missing the context ""from the era"" (sajandist pärit), which is important for understanding the time frame.
- It incorrectly translates ""Bütsantsi kunsti"" to ""Butsants Art,"" which should be ""Byzantine art"" to match the reference.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of the same quality as the reference translation due to the loss of context and the incorrect art movement reference. The reference translation provides a more accurate and complete representation of the source text.

|Source: Ta suhtub tulevikku nii, nagu meie suhtume minevikku.|
|Machine translation: It is looking to the future as we look at the past.|
|Reference translation: He sees future in the same way as we see the past.|

**Step 1: Identify the main components of the sentence**
- Source: Subject (Ta, ""He""), verb (suhtub, ""sees""), object (tulevikku, ""future""), comparison (nii, nagu, ""in the same way""), reference to past (meie suhtume minevikku, ""we see the past"")

**Step 2: Compare the structure and meaning**
- Machine translation: The structure is slightly altered, with ""It is looking"" instead of ""He sees"" and ""as we look at the past"" instead of ""nii, nagu meie suhtume minevikku"". This change results in a less accurate representation of the source sentence.

**Step 3: Analyze differences**
- Subject: The machine translation uses ""It"" instead of ""He"", which is a misinterpretation of the subject.
- Verb: ""Is looking"" is a continuous action, while ""sees"" is a simple action, which might not convey the same nuance as the source.
- Comparison: The machine translation uses ""as we look at the past"" as a direct comparison, while the source uses a more idiomatic expression ""nii, nagu meie suhtume minevikku"" which implies a similar approach.

**Step 4: Conclusion**
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It loses the subject specificity (""He""), changes the verb to a less precise form, and does not capture the idiomatic expression for comparison. The reference translation better conveys the meaning and structure of the original Estonian sentence.

Analysis:
1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning, with the main information being that the national banking system in Trinidad and Tobago is supervised by the Central Bank, and it operates under a law enacted in 1986.
2. The only difference between the two is the use of the verb ""teostab"" in the source text, which means ""carries out"" or ""performs"" (in the context of supervision). In the machine translation, this is translated as ""operate,"" which is a suitable verb to describe the functioning of the Central Bank. However, ""teostab"" is not directly translated, as ""operates"" is used to convey the same idea of the bank's functioning.
3. The punctuation at the end of the sentence is identical in both the machine translation and the reference translation.

|Machine translation: Yet Sofia's mother, Hanna Salin, was very pleased with her mother.|
|Reference translation: Yet Sofia 's mother , Hanna Salin , was very pleased with her.|

1. **Subject identification**: The source text refers to ""Sofia ema"" (Sofia's mother) as the subject, while the machine translation and reference translation both correctly identify this as ""Sofia's mother, Hanna Salin.""

2. **Verb and tense**: The source uses ""oli"" (was) in the past tense, which is correctly translated as ""was"" in both the machine translation and the reference translation.

3. **Object and possessive pronoun**: The source text has ""temaga"" (with her), which is a possessive pronoun referring to Sofia's mother. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""with her mother,"" which is redundant. The reference translation omits this part, as it is implied that the mother is pleased with Sofia, not with herself.

4. **Adverb**: The source text includes ""väga rahul"" (very pleased), which is correctly translated as ""very pleased"" in both the machine translation and the reference translation.

5. **Punctuation and capitalization**: The source text does not have any punctuation or capitalization differences. The machine translation capitalizes ""her"" after ""mother,"" which is not necessary in this context, while the reference translation follows the same capitalization rules as the source.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it includes the redundant phrase ""with her mother"" when referring to the object of the sentence. The reference translation omits this, making it more concise and accurate. Other aspects, such as subject identification, verb tense, and adverb, are correctly translated in both. The punctuation and capitalization differences are minor and do not significantly affect the meaning.

- Source: ""Esimest Cuddalore'i vastu saadetud Prantsuse väge üllatati ja võideti seal lähedal naabobi vägede ja Briti garnisoni poolt detsembris 1746.""
- Machine translation: ""The first French Strait sent against Cuddalore was surprised and won there by neighbouring troops and the British garnisant in December 1746.""

Difference: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Prantsuse väge"" (French force) as ""French Strait,"" which is a geographical term, not a force. The correct translation should be ""French force.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""The first French Strait sent against Cuddalore was surprised and won there by neighbouring troops and the British garnisant in December 1746.""
- Reference translation: ""The first French force sent against Cuddalore was surprised and defeated there by the Nabob's troops and the British garrison in December 1746.""

Difference: The machine translation omits the word ""võideti"" (defeated) and replaces it with ""won,"" which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly uses ""defeated."" Additionally, the machine translation uses ""British garnisant,"" while the reference translation uses ""British garrison,"" which is a more common term for a military unit.

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the incorrect translation of ""Prantsuse väge"" and the incorrect use of ""won"" instead of ""defeated.""

|Reference translation: In the mid-19th century, the church was repaired and an independent congregation was founded there.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""kirikut remonditi"" (the church was repaired), which is accurately translated in both the machine and reference translations.
2. The machine translation states ""founded on an independent collection,"" which might be interpreted as the church being established with a separate financial entity. However, the reference translation uses ""an independent congregation was founded there,"" which implies a group of people coming together for religious purposes, not necessarily a financial collection.
3. The phrase ""selle juurde"" (there) in the source text is not directly translated in the machine translation, which might cause a slight loss of clarity about the location where the congregation was founded.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""iseseisev kogudus"" as ""an independent collection"" instead of ""an independent congregation."" This difference affects the meaning, as the reference translation suggests a religious community being established, while the machine translation could imply a more secular context. The reference translation also includes the word ""there"" to indicate the location, which is not present in the machine translation.

|Reference translation: The local elders who had come to meet with Rudolf announced that they have long been in peace with the rivals and have been asking for them to leave their land.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject**: In the source, ""kohalikud vanemad"" (local parents) is translated as ""local parents"" in the machine translation, but it should be ""local elders"" in the reference translation, which is a more accurate term for the older community members.
2. **Proper noun**: The machine translation has ""Rudolfi"" which is likely a typo or incorrect handling of the proper noun Rudolf. In the reference translation, it is ""Rudolf"" without the ""i"" suffix, which is correct.
3. **Verb tense**: The source uses ""teatasid"" (announced) in the past tense, which is correctly translated as ""announced"" in both the machine and reference translations.
4. **Peace and request**: The meaning is preserved in both translations, but the structure is slightly different.

|Reference translation: The Portuguese banking sector was severely affected by the deep economic recession and the subsequent debt crisis.|

|Analysis|
1. **""suure majandussurutise""** (machine translation) vs. **""deep economic recession""** (reference translation): The machine translation uses ""severe economic downturn,"" which is a similar concept but not as specific as ""deep recession."" The reference translation emphasizes the severity and depth of the recession, which is more accurate.
2. **""järgnenud võlakriisi""** (machine translation) vs. **""subsequent debt crisis""** (reference translation): Both convey the idea of a crisis that followed the recession, but ""subsequent"" in the reference translation is clearer and more concise than ""järgnenud"" (following), which might not be as easily understood by non-native speakers.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the choice of words that describe the economic situation, with ""severe economic downturn"" instead of ""deep economic recession"" and ""järgnenud võlakriisi"" instead of ""subsequent debt crisis.""

This is a significant difference, as ""number"" implies individual occurrences, whereas ""volume"" refers to the total amount.

2. **Gradual decrease vs. Long fall**: The reference translation uses ""gradually decreases"" to convey the process of the decrease, which is more accurate than the machine translation's ""falls long,"" which suggests a duration rather than a rate of change.

3. **Almost not rain vs. Almost fell**: The reference translation correctly states ""it almost does not rain"" to express the near absence of rainfall, whereas the machine translation says ""it almost fell at all,"" which is confusing and does not convey the intended meaning.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: See on just niisugune metafüüsiline küsimus, mida loogilised empiristid lootsid seletuse analüüsimisel vältida.
Machine translation: This is precisely the sort of metaphysical issue that the logical empirists were hoping to avoid when the explanation was analysed.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- The source text uses ""See on"" (This is) as the beginning, while the machine translation uses ""This is"" directly, which is a direct match.
- The source text has ""just niisugune"" (precisely the sort of), and the machine translation also has ""precisely the sort of"", which is a correct translation.
- The source text has ""metafüüsiline küsimus"" (metaphysical issue), and the machine translation has the same phrase, which is accurate.
- The source text has ""mida loogilised empiristid lootsid"" (that the logical empirists were hoping to avoid), and the machine translation has ""when the explanation was analysed"", which is a rephrased version of the same idea.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- The machine translation and the reference translation are identical, except for the trailing period at the end of the sentence. The reference translation omits the period, which is a minor formatting difference.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with only a minor formatting difference (the absence of a period at the end) compared to the reference translation. The content and meaning are consistent between the two. The main difference lies in the punctuation, which does not affect the quality of the translation in terms of meaning.

- Machine translation: ""Particular attention was given to Poland in the resolution, where the restriction of the rights of homosexuals has been supported at the level of speeches by government officials.""

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The machine translation has ""the level of speeches"" instead of ""valitsusametnike sõnavõttude tasandil"" (level of statements by government officials). This is a direct translation error, as ""sõnavõttude tasandil"" refers to the level of statements, not speeches.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: ""Particular attention was given to Poland in the resolution, where the restriction of the rights of homosexuals has been supported at the level of speeches by government officials.""

Step 4: Analyze the difference.
- The reference translation is faithful to the source text, maintaining the meaning that the restriction of rights for homosexuals has been supported at the level of statements made by government officials.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the specific phrase ""valitsusametnike sõnavõttude tasandil"" which is translated as ""the level of speeches"" in the machine translation.

- In the machine translation, ""peaminister"" is translated as ""Prime Minister,"" which is correct.

Step 3: Analyze the addition or removal of words
- The machine translation adds ""new government"" at the end, which is not present in the source sentence. The reference translation omits this phrase, as it is implied by the context that a new government is being appointed.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation has differences in the country name (""Soome"" vs. ""Finland"") and omits the implied ""new"" part of the sentence. The reference translation accurately captures the main idea, with the correct country name and the implied ""new"" aspect. The main issue is the country name, which should be ""Estonia"" instead of ""Finland."" The reference translation is more faithful to the source text in terms of meaning and structure.

1. **Reading the source text**: The source text in Estonian is ""Tegusid endid võib nimetada headeks või halbadeks vastavalt motiivile.""
2. **Reading the machine translation**: The machine translation provided is ""Doing so can be described as good or bad in accordance with the motive.""
3. **Reading the reference translation**: The reference translation is ""Acts can be described as good or bad in accordance with the motive.""

4. **Comparing the translations**: 
   - **Subject**: In the source, ""Tegusid endid"" refers to ""acts"" or ""actions"" (plural). The machine translation uses ""Doing so"" which is a more general phrase and does not specifically refer to actions.
   - **Verb**: The source uses ""võib nimetada"" (can be described), while the machine translation uses ""can be described"" which is a direct translation.
   - **Adjectives**: ""heidaks või halbadeks"" (good or bad) is translated as ""good or bad"" in both the machine and reference translations.
   - **Prepositional phrase**: ""vastavalt motiivile"" (in accordance with the motive) is translated similarly in both.

5. **Analysis**: The main difference lies in the subject, where the machine translation uses ""Doing so"" which is a more abstract reference to the actions, while the source text specifies ""acts"" directly. The rest of the sentence structure and meaning are preserved well in the machine translation.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: ""Et jõud ja agressiivsus olid neis ühiskondades viimsed võimu vormid, hakkasid naised domineerima.""
Machine translation: ""Since force and aggression were the last form of power in these societies, women began to dominate.""

Difference: The machine translation uses ""the last form"" while the source text uses ""viimsed võimu vormid,"" which can be translated to ""the ultimate forms"" or ""the last forms"" in English, but the context suggests that ""viimsed"" implies a more definitive or absolute sense, closer to ""ultimate"" than ""last"" in the sense of being the final stage.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: ""Since force and aggression were the last form of power in these societies, women began to dominate.""
Reference translation: ""Since force and aggression were the ultimate forms of power in these societies, women began to dominate.""

Difference: The main difference is the choice of the word ""last"" versus ""ultimate"" in the translation. The reference translation uses ""ultimate,"" which aligns better with the source text's emphasis on the final or most decisive forms of power.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the choice of ""last"" versus ""ultimate,"" with the reference translation providing a more accurate reflection of the source text's meaning by emphasizing the absolute nature of force and aggression as the ultimate forms of power in the societies.

Step 1: Identify the main subject and action in the source text.
Source: The main subject is ""põlengus"" (fire) and the action is ""vigastada"" (to injure).

Step 2: Compare the subject in the machine translation.
Machine translation: The subject is ""generation,"" which is a mistranslation of ""põlengus.""

Step 3: Compare the action in the machine translation.
Machine translation: The action is ""injured,"" which is correct but the context suggests it should be ""vigastada"" in Estonian.

Step 4: Compare the details provided (numbers and gender).
Machine translation: It mentions ""twenty-five people, ten women, and fifteen men,"" which is correct.

Step 5: Compare the context of the injury.
Machine translation: The context is ""in the generation,"" which is incorrect. The correct context should be ""in the fire"" as in the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the subject (it incorrectly translates ""põlengus"" as ""generation"") and the context (it should be ""in the fire"" instead of ""in the generation""). The details about the number of people and their gender are correct. The action ""vigastada"" is not included in the machine translation, but it is implied in the reference translation through the context.

Step 1: Identify the main components of the source text
- ""Järgmised Ülemraada valimised"" refers to ""next round of elections""
- ""toimuvad"" means ""will take place""
- ""26. oktoobril"" specifies the date, ""26 October""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""The next round of elections will take place on 26 October.""
- Reference translation: ""The next round of elections of the Verkhovna Rada will take place on 26 October.""

Difference analysis:
- The machine translation omits the ""Verkhovna Rada"" which is a specific reference to the Ukrainian parliament in the context of the source text, which is likely Estonian. In Estonian, there is no direct equivalent for ""Verkhovna Rada,"" so it's not included in the machine translation.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is accurate in conveying the general idea of the next round of elections happening on 26 October but loses the specific context of the Estonian parliament (Ülemraada) by not including ""Verkhovna Rada."" The reference translation provides a more precise translation for an English-speaking audience by specifying the governing body.

|im_start| Analyzing the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. **""parade"" vs. ""parasite""**: The machine translation uses ""parade,"" which implies a public display or show, while the reference translation uses ""parasite,"" suggesting that the sanctity is feeding off or benefiting from love and its experiences. The latter conveys a more metaphorical and potentially negative connotation, whereas the former is more neutral.

2. **Omission of ""kaasnevatel""**: The machine translation omits the Estonian word ""kaasnevatel,"" which means ""that accompanies"" in English. This is important context, as it clarifies that the experience being referred to is not separate from love but is part of it.

3. **Punctuation**: The machine translation does not include the comma after ""love"" in the English version, which is present in the reference translation. This comma is crucial for clarity and to separate the two ideas in the sentence.

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation, as it changes the meaning slightly by using a different word choice and omitting important context. The reference translation captures the nuance of the original Estonian sentence better.

2. **Reference translation**: In 7 of the 13 regions, the right-wing Republican Party won the election, while in 5 regions the left-wing Socialist Party won the elections.
3. **Machine translation**: In 13 regions in 7, the Right-wing Republican Party won the elections, while in 5 regions the Left-wing Socialist Party won the elections.

**Analysis**:
- The machine translation has an issue with the structure of the phrase ""7 piirkonnas"" (7 regions). In the reference translation, it is correctly rephrased as ""7 of the 13 regions"" to indicate that the Right-wing Republican Party won in 7 out of the total 13 regions. The machine translation incorrectly places ""7"" before ""piirkonnast"" and omits the ""of the"" part, which changes the meaning.
- The reference translation uses ""right-wing"" and ""left-wing"" to describe the political parties, while the machine translation uses ""Right-wing"" and ""Left-wing"" without the hyphens, which is a minor difference but still affects clarity.
- The capitalization of ""Republican Party"" and ""Socialist Party"" is consistent in both the source and reference, but the machine translation capitalizes them as well, which is correct but not a significant issue.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Ülo võtab ette tavatu teo ja otsustab kosja minna ning kutsub Jürka endale isameheks kaasa.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The general does an unorthodox act and decides to go to space and calls on Mr Jürka to take his father along.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Ülo undertakes an unorthodox act of proposing marriage and invites Jürka to be his best man.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""kosja minna"" (to go somewhere), which could be interpreted as going to space, but it's not explicitly stated. The machine translation assumes it as ""go to space.""
- The source text says ""endale isameheks kaasa"" (to himself as a father), which implies Jürka is being asked to be a support figure, possibly a father figure in some context. The machine translation translates this as ""take his father along,"" which is a different interpretation.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly interprets ""tavatu teo"" as ""an unorthodox act"" and connects it to the context of proposing marriage, which is a more suitable interpretation than going to space.
- The reference translation also changes ""isameheks kaasa"" to ""his best man,"" which is a more accurate translation of the role in a marriage context.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""kosja minna"" and ""endale isameheks kaasa."" The machine translation assumes a space-related context, while the reference translation correctly interprets it as proposing marriage and asking Jürka to be a best man. The quality of the translation could be improved by considering the cultural context and nuances of the source text.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: School science to be arduous, but wisdom is easy to find, enjoyable and natural food for the human mind.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""tarkus"" (wisdom) as ""easily lethal"", which is a drastic change in meaning and does not fit the context.
- The reference translation uses ""wisdom is easy to find"" (tarkus on hõlpsasti leitav), which is a more accurate and meaningful expression than the machine's ""easily lethal"".
- The reference translation also changes ""loomupärane toidus"" (natural food) to ""food for the human mind"" (toidu inimmõtetele), which is a more suitable interpretation of the original source.

|Reference translation: This time, they protested against the rampant corruption in the tax authority and called for the expansion of democratic freedoms.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Sel korral""** (In this case) - Machine translation: ""This time"" - The reference translation uses ""This time"" as well, which is a suitable equivalent for the context.
2. **""melt maksuametis""** (in the tax office) - Machine translation: ""in tax office"" - The reference translation omits ""melt"" (literally ""in the heart""), which is not necessary in English. It's more accurate to say ""tax authority"" instead, as in the reference.
3. **""vohava korruptsiooni vastu""** (against corruptive corruption) - Machine translation: ""against the rampant corruption"" - The reference translation simplifies this to ""against the rampant corruption,"" which conveys the same meaning.
4. **""ja nõuti""** (and demanded) - Machine translation: ""and calls for"" - The reference translation uses ""and called for,"" which is a more direct and common way to express the same action in English.
5. **""demokraatlike vabaduste laiendamist""** (expansion of democratic freedoms) - Machine translation: ""the expansion of democratic freedoms"" - The machine translation is accurate here.

Overall, the machine translation captures the essence of the source text but loses some nuance and word choice.

- Machine translation: ""Expulsion options no longer appear to be so important, because decision making is taking place largely before, and it does not seem so obvious that it can be cultivated.""

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- The machine translation uses ""Expulsion options"" instead of ""Eksplitsiitne valik"" (which means ""explicit choice"" in Estonian). This is a direct translation error.
- The machine translation omits the word ""ilmne"" (which means ""obvious"" in Estonian), making the sentence less clear about the perception of the possibility of cultivating something.

The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""prantsuskeelsete riikide ühendusse"" as it does not convey the concept of a linguistic community. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original meaning.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: Separatistide teatel alustasid valitsusväed rünnakut Luganskile.
- Machine translation: According to the Separatists, government forces launched an attack on Lugansk.

The machine translation captures the main idea that government forces launched an attack on Lugansk, and it attributes this information to the separatists. However, there is a difference in the structure and word choice.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: According to the Separatists, government forces launched an attack on Lugansk.
- Reference translation: According to the Separatists, government forces launched an attack on Lugansk.

The reference translation is identical to the machine translation, except for the trailing ""Lugansk"" in both. The reference translation also omits the word ""ile"" at the end of the source, which is likely a typo or a less common way of expressing the destination in this context.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with the main difference being the omission of the word ""ile"" at the end, which might not be significant in the context of the translation. The structure and meaning are consistent with the reference translation. The quality of the translation can be considered good, but a minor improvement could be made by including the word ""ile"" if it is deemed necessary for clarity.

|Machine translation: The historic descriptions of the Waterloo battle also need to be careful, especially when British historians are the author of a historical review.|
|Reference translation: One must also be careful with the historic descriptions of the Waterloo battle, especially when the historical overview is authored by British historians.|

|Analysis|
1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning, emphasizing the need for caution when dealing with the historical descriptions of the Waterloo battle, particularly when they are written by British historians.
2. The structure of the sentences is similar, with the main difference being the use of ""a historical review"" in the machine translation and ""the historical overview"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, as both phrases refer to an examination or account of the past event.
3. The phrase ""ajaloolise ülevaate autoriks"" in the source is translated to ""the author of a historical review"" in the machine translation, which is a slightly awkward phrasing but still conveys the intended meaning that the British historians are the writers of the historical overview.

Overall, the machine translation is accurate but could be improved by using a more natural-sounding phrase for ""historical review."" The core message is the same as the reference translation, so the quality is good but with a minor room for refinement.

1. **Sentence structure**: Both the machine translation and the reference translation have the same sentence structure, with the main clause ""The largest demonstrations took place in Rome"" followed by a relative clause describing the events in Rome.

2. **Word-for-word translation**: The machine translation is almost identical to the reference translation, with only a minor difference in the punctuation after ""Rome"". The reference translation omits the space after ""Rome"", which is a common style choice in English to separate the main clause from the relative clause.

3. **Grammar**: The grammar in both translations is correct, with the past tense ""took place"" and the passive voice ""were attacked"" used appropriately.

4. **Translation accuracy**: The main ideas from the source text are accurately conveyed in both translations: the location (Rome), the events (attacks on police headquarters and the Olympic Committee building), and the fact that these were the largest demonstrations.

5. **Fluency**: The machine translation is fluent and idiomatic, with no major issues that would affect comprehension.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality and is very similar to the reference translation, with only a minor punctuation difference. The main content and meaning are accurately conveyed, making it a suitable translation for the given context.

Source: Üht raekoja arkaadkäigu sammast kasutati häbipostina.
Reference translation: One of the pillars of the Town Hall arcade was used as a pillory.

1. Identifying key phrases and words:
   - ""Üht raekoja"" (One of the pillars)
   - ""arkaadkäigu"" (arcade)
   - ""sammast"" (of the march)
   - ""kasutati"" (was used)
   - ""häbipostina"" (as a disgrace)

2. Comparing machine translation (MT) with reference translation (RT):
   - MT: ""One of the pillars of the Rown Chamber was used as a disgrace.""
   - RT: ""One of the pillars of the Town Hall arcade was used as a pillory.""

3. Differences analysis:
   - ""Rown Chamber"" (MT) vs ""Town Hall arcade"" (RT): The source text refers to ""raekoja arkaad,"" which is the Estonian term for the arcade in a town hall, not a chamber. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Rown Chamber.""
   - ""disgrace"" (MT) vs ""pillory"" (RT): The reference translation uses the term ""pillory,"" which is a historical punishment where a person is placed in a stocks, as a more accurate representation of the context. The machine translation translates it as ""disgrace,"" which is a more abstract concept and does not convey the physical punishment.

4. Conclusion:
   The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it incorrectly identifies the location (Rown Chamber instead of Town Hall arcade) and uses a less specific term for the punishment (disgrace instead of pillory). The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the original source text.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Ainulaadsena nägemine on nägemise viis, nii et ainulaadsus on nägemisviisi tagajärg, mitte põhjus.""
- Machine translation: ""Being seen as a unique is a way of seeing, so uniqueness is the result, not the cause, of the way we see it.""

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, which is that being seen as unique is a perspective and uniqueness is a consequence of that perspective, not its origin.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""Being seen as a unique is a way of seeing, so uniqueness is the result, not the cause, of the way we see it.""
- Reference translation: ""Being seen as a unique is a way of seeing, so uniqueness is the result, not the cause, of the way we see it.""

The machine translation and the reference translation are almost identical, with only minor differences in punctuation (the reference translation has a space after ""Being seen as a unique"" and before the comma). The meaning is the same in both.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality and closely aligns with the reference translation. The differences are minor and do not affect the overall meaning. The main idea is accurately conveyed, and the structure is preserved.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Another important innovation in this sense was to make figures of proportion.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Another important conceptual innovation was to make figures out of proportions.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the source text
- The machine translation has ""proportsioonidest arvude tegemine"" which can be translated as ""to make figures of proportion"" in English. However, the reference translation has ""out of proportions,"" which suggests a focus on the idea of using proportions rather than literally making figures proportional.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The main difference lies in the choice of words. The machine translation uses ""proportion"" to describe the figures, while the reference translation uses ""out of proportions"" to imply a creative or conceptual use of proportions, rather than just maintaining proportion.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not capture the nuance of using proportions in a creative or conceptual sense. The reference translation emphasizes the idea of figures that deviate from or challenge proportions, which is not explicitly conveyed in the machine translation.

|Machine translation: Bbovies pass on to humans and other vertebrate insects.
|Reference translation: Arboviruses pass on to humans and other vertebrate via blood-sucking insects.
|Analysis:|
1. The source text refers to ""Arbovirused"" (Arboviruses), which are a specific type of viruses, not ""Bbovies"" which is a misinterpretation or a typo.
2. The machine translation omits the word ""verdimevate"" (transmitting), which is crucial for understanding the context, as it describes the type of insects involved (blood-sucking).
3. The reference translation correctly uses ""via"" to indicate the means of transmission, which is ""edasi verdimevate putukatega"" in the source text.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the correct term for arboviruses, the inclusion of the word ""verdimevate"" to describe the type of insects, and the use of ""via"" to convey the mode of transmission.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: This caused further fragmentation of Syria, with Atabek Kerbogha ruling in Mosul.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""It further fragments Syria"" while the reference translation uses ""This caused further fragmentation of Syria"". The reference implies a cause-and-effect relationship, which the machine translation does not explicitly state.
- The machine translation uses ""with Atabek Kerbogha in power"" while the reference uses ""with Atabek Kerbogha ruling"". The verb ""ruling"" conveys a sense of authority and control, which is more precise than ""in power"" in this context.

The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the cause-and-effect relationship and the choice of verbs. The reference translation provides a clearer connection between the event and the result, and uses a more specific verb to describe Atabek Kerbogha's position.

1. **Action**: The source text refers to ""tunnistamise viis"" (way of recognising), while the machine translation translates it as ""recognising evil"". The reference translation, however, interprets it as ""confessing evil"", which is a more accurate reflection of the original context.

2. **Emphasis**: The source uses ""haletsus"" (doubt or mistrust), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses ""compassion"" or ""pity"" (""tunne"" in Estonian), which conveys a similar emotional aspect but is more suitable for the context of acknowledging evil.

Analysis:
1. The source text uses ""külastas"" (visited) in the past tense, which is correctly translated as ""was visited"" in both the machine and reference translations.
2. The source mentions ""asevälisminister"" (deputy minister) which is translated as ""Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs"" in both translations, maintaining the meaning.
3. The name ""Urmas Paediga"" is slightly different in the source and reference translations. The source has ""Paediga"" while the reference has ""Paet"". It seems the reference translation has a more common and correct form of the name, ""Paet,"" which is the Estonian Foreign Minister's full name.
4. The verb ""kohtus"" (met) is translated as ""met"" in the machine translation and ""met with"" in the reference translation. Both convey the same meaning, but the reference adds the preposition ""with"" for clarity.

Conclusion:

Step 1: Compare the structure and meaning of the source text and machine translation.

- Machine translation: ""Until 1993 the dollar's rate was national fixed, after which the exchange rate has been floating.""
- Reference translation: ""Until 1993 the dollar 's rate was fixed by the state, afterwards the exchange rate has been floating.""

Step 2: Identify differences in translation.
- The machine translation uses ""national fixed"" instead of ""riiklikult fikseeritud"" (literally ""country-fixed""), which might imply a broader scope than the original Estonian term, which specifically refers to the state.
- The machine translation omits the possessive apostrophe in ""the dollar's rate,"" which is present in the reference translation, making it clearer that the rate belongs to the dollar.

Step 3: Evaluate the impact of these differences on the translation quality.
- The difference in the scope of ""fixed"" might slightly alter the meaning, as ""riiklikult"" implies a more specific involvement of the state, while ""national"" could be interpreted more generally.
- The apostrophe in ""the dollar's rate"" is a minor but important detail that affects clarity and accuracy.

Conclusion: The machine translation is generally accurate but loses some nuance and clarity compared to the reference translation. The main difference lies in the more specific reference to the state's involvement in fixing the rate, and the lack of the possessive apostrophe.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The 2014 edition is a front line for Mary Midgley.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The 2014 edition includes a foreword by Mary Midgley.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- In the source text, ""varustatud"" means ""equipped with"" or ""features"" in the context of a foreword, referring to Mary Midgley's contribution.
- The machine translation translates ""varustatud"" as ""front line,"" which is a metaphorical and unrelated term to a foreword.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""varustatud"" as ""includes,"" which indicates the presence of a foreword by Mary Midgley.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation mistakes the meaning of ""varustatud"" and incorrectly translates it as ""front line,"" which is not a suitable term for describing a book's content.
- The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text by using ""includes.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality because it inaccurately translates the term ""varustatud"" and does not convey the correct meaning of the source text, which is about a foreword by Mary Midgley. The reference translation is more faithful to the original meaning.

The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly consistent in terms of content and structure. Here are the key differences I've observed:

1. Capitalization: In the source text, ""Vallutatud alad"" (conquered areas) is not capitalized, while in both translations, ""Manchukuo"" is capitalized as it is a proper noun referring to a specific region. The reference translation follows this capitalization correctly.

2. Word order: The word order in the machine translation is slightly different, with ""on 9 March 1932"" placed before ""a puppet government was formed there,"" while in the reference translation, it is placed after. This difference is minor and does not affect the overall meaning.

3. Punctuation: The machine translation has a comma after ""Mandžukuoks,"" which is not present in the reference translation. This is a typographical error and should be removed.

4. Ellipsis: The reference translation includes an ellipsis after ""led by the former Chinese Emperor,"" which is not present in the machine translation. This is likely a stylistic choice to indicate a pause or to emphasize the subject.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate, with only a few minor differences in punctuation and capitalization. The meaning and structure are preserved well, and the main content is consistent with the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>|im_sep|>|im_end|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Paremuselt teise tulemuse saavutas valitsev Rahvapartei 27,1% häälte ja 33 kohaga parlamendis.""
- Machine translation: ""The second best result was achieved by 27.1% of the votes of the governing People's Party and 33 seats in Parliament.""

Difference: The machine translation has ""governing"" instead of ""valitsev"" (literally ""voting"" or ""elected"" in Estonian), which might imply a different level of control or influence. The source uses ""valitsev"" to describe the People's Party as the one in power, while the machine translation omits this context.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""The second best result was achieved by 27.1% of the votes of the governing People's Party and 33 seats in Parliament.""
- Reference translation: ""The second best result was achieved by the ruling People 's Party with 27.1 % of the vote and 33 seats in parliament.""

Difference: The reference translation has ""ruling"" instead of ""governing,"" which is a more accurate term to describe the party in control. Additionally, the reference uses ""of the vote"" instead of ""of the votes"" and ""parliament"" instead of ""Parliament"" (capitalized), which are minor differences but still affect the style.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the adjective used to describe the People's Party (governing vs. ruling) and the phrasing ""of the votes"" instead of ""with 27.1% of the vote."" The capitalization of ""Parliament"" in the reference is also a difference, though it's a stylistic choice. Overall, the machine translation loses some nuance and accuracy in conveying the source text's meaning.

Machine translation: The rose-tinted comfort was that he was in the village.

|im_start| Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The comforts of the Town Hall included heating.

|im_start| Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
In the source text, ""Raesaali mugavuste hulka kuulus see"" refers to the amenities or conveniences of Raesaali (which could be a place, possibly a town hall), and ""et teda sai kütta"" means that one of those conveniences was the availability of heating.

|im_start| Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
The machine translation incorrectly interprets ""Raesaali mugavuste hulka kuulus see"" as ""The rose-tinted comfort was that"" and translates ""teda sai kütta"" as ""he was in the village,"" which does not match the context of heating being a comfort.

|im_start| Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it misinterprets the source text, focusing on a romanticized comfort rather than the specific comfort of heating being provided in a town hall. The correct translation should be: ""The Town Hall's amenities included heating.""

|Source: Kreeta matusepaikadest on leitud mükeene päritolu relvi.|
|Machine translation: mysterious weapons of origin have been found in waste-free distilleries.|
|Reference translation: Mycenaean weapons have been found in Cretan burial sites.|

1. **Translation of key terms**: 
   - ""Kreeta"" (Cretan) is not translated accurately in the machine translation, which uses ""waste-free distilleries"" instead of referring to the location.
   - ""matusepaikadest"" (burial sites) is not translated correctly, as it is translated as ""distilleries"" which is unrelated to the context.
   - ""mükene päritolu"" (mysterious origin) is not directly translated, instead, the machine translation uses ""mysterious weapons of origin"" which is a more general term but loses the specific reference to the origin being unclear.

2. **Sentence structure**: The structure of the sentence is altered in the machine translation. The source sentence places the focus on the discovery of ""mükene päritolu relvi"" (mysterious weapons of origin) at ""Kreeta matusepaikadest"" (Cretan burial sites), while the machine translation moves the focus to ""waste-free distilleries"" which is not the correct context.

3. **Accuracy and context**: The machine translation misses the specific reference to Mycenaean culture, which is a crucial part of the historical context. The reference translation clearly states ""Mycenaean weapons,"" which is a more accurate and specific term than the vague ""mysterious weapons.""

4. **Translation quality**: The machine translation is of lower quality due to inaccuracies in term translation, incorrect context, and altered sentence structure. It does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, context, and specificity. It would be more appropriate to evaluate the quality as inadequate or needing improvement.

|Source: Iraagis Kirkūki linnas ründas enesetaputerrorist lõhkeainega täidetud veoautoga politseijaoskonda.|
|Machine translation: In the town of Kirkūk in Iraq a suicide bomber attacked a police station full of a truck filled with a explosives.|
|Reference translation: In the town of Kirkūk in Iraq a suicide terrorist attacked a police station with a truck filled with explosives.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""enesetaputerrorist"" (suicide terrorist), which is correctly translated as ""suicide terrorist"" in the reference translation. The machine translation omits the word ""suicide"" and instead uses ""a truck filled with a explosives,"" which is less precise.
2. The source text uses ""lõhkeainega täidetud"" (filled with explosives), while the machine translation incorrectly combines this into ""a truck filled with a explosives."" The reference translation correctly separates it as ""with a truck filled with explosives.""
3. The verb ""ründas"" (attacked) is translated accurately in both the machine and reference translations.
4. The phrase ""politseijaoskonda"" (police station) is translated consistently in both the machine and reference translations.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation has a few inaccuracies, particularly in the description of the explosives-filled truck. It omits the term ""suicide"" and combines ""lõhkeainega täidetud"" into a less clear phrase. The reference translation is more precise and faithful to the source text. The main difference lies in the clarity and accuracy of the description of the explosives.|im_end|

1. **Verb translation**: The machine translation uses ""represented"" while the reference translation uses ""accounted for"". Both verbs convey a similar meaning in this context, but ""accounted for"" is a more common and precise term for discussing the proportion of GDP.

2. **Article**: The machine translation omits the apostrophe from ""Zambia's"", which is a possessive form in English. The reference translation includes it, making it ""Zambia 's"", which is correct.

3. **Punctuation**: The machine translation has a space after ""Zambia's"", while the reference translation does not. This is a minor difference, but it's more consistent with the reference to not have the space.

4. **Sentence structure**: Both translations convey the same information, but the reference translation is slightly more natural in English, with the phrase ""in 2012"" following the subject ""Zambia 's defence expenditure"" rather than being separated by ""represented"".

5. **Percentage symbol**: The machine translation uses a period (.) to represent the percentage, while the reference translation uses a space and a percent sign (%). The reference is more standard in this case.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate, but there are a few minor differences in style and punctuation that could be improved to match the reference translation more closely. The core meaning is the same, so the quality is high, but with some refinement, it could be even better.

|Reference translation: If there is no agreement among scientists as to whether the fundamental problems in this field have been solved, the search for rules will play a role that it usually does not have.|

Analysis:
1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning, with the main difference being the choice of words for ""valdkonna"" (area) and ""field"" in the second part of the sentence. The machine translation uses ""this area"" while the reference translation uses ""this field."" In Estonian, ""valdkonna"" is commonly used, but ""field"" is also a suitable translation, especially in an English context where it might be more natural.

2. The structure of the sentence is preserved in both translations, with the conditional clause followed by the main clause about the role of rule searching.

3. The phrase ""mida sel tavaliselt pole"" (which it usually does not have) is translated accurately in both versions.

Overall, the machine translation is of high quality and captures the essence of the source text. The only minor difference is the choice of ""area"" vs. ""field,"" which does not significantly affect the meaning. The translation is coherent and faithful to the original.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Ülestõusu ebaõnnestumist seletab Saks ""rahva ürgse vabadusihaga"", mis muutis organiseeritud ülestõusu mässuks.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The failure of the referendum explains the Saks with the 'People's Pringe of Freedom', which turned the organised uprising into a rebels.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Saks explains the failure of the uprising with the "" people 's primordial desire for freedom "" , which turned an organised uprising into a revolt.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation has a mistranslation of ""rahva ürgse vabadusihaga"" (people's urgent desire for freedom) as ""People's Pringe of Freedom"", which is not a standard phrase and does not convey the same meaning.
- The machine translation also incorrectly translates ""organiseeritud ülestõusu mässuks"" (organized uprising into a mass event) as ""a rebels"", which is awkward and does not convey the idea of a revolt.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation fails to capture the concept of ""primordial desire"" and replaces it with a non-standard phrase.
- It incorrectly translates ""organiseeritud ülestõusu mässuks"" to ""rebels"" instead of ""a revolt.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation due to inaccuracies in terminology and the inability to convey the nuances of the source text, particularly the concept of ""primordial desire"" and the distinction between an uprising and a revolt.

|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: Venemaa president Vladimir Putin kohtus Vatikanis paavst Benedictus XVI.
- Machine translation: Russian President Vladimir Putin met Pope Benedict XVI in the Vatican.

The machine translation has changed ""Venemaa president"" to ""Russian President"" and removed the word ""kohtus"" (which means ""met"" in Estonian) and ""Vatikanis"" (which means ""in the Vatican"" in Estonian). It also added the word ""in"" to connect the location.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: Russian President Vladimir Putin met Pope Benedict XVI in the Vatican.
- Reference translation: Russian President Vladimir Putin met Pope Benedict XVI in the Vatican.

The reference translation is identical to the machine translation, except for the capitalization of ""Russian President"" (which is typically capitalized in English). The meaning and structure of the sentence are the same.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The main difference is the omission of the Estonian word ""kohtus"" and the addition of ""in"" in the machine translation, which is a direct translation from ""kohtus"" to ""met"" in English. The reference translation keeps the same structure, which is more accurate in terms of conveying the meeting event.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it omits the verb ""kohtus"" and adds ""in"" to connect the location, which slightly alters the meaning and structure of the sentence. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian text, preserving the meeting event and the location without altering the meaning.

|Reference translation: At that time, however, it was not known that the stripes were caused by a virus belonging to the family of Potyviridae, which people accidentally transferred from jasmins to tulips.|

|Analysis|
1. ""triipe põhjustas"" (stripes caused) vs ""tribal acid was caused"" - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""triipe"" (stripes) as ""tribal acid"", which is a misinterpretation of the context.
2. ""Potyviridae sugukonda kuuluv viirus"" (a virus belonging to the family Potyviridae) vs ""a virus belonging to the family of Potyviridae"" - Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation uses a more natural English structure.
3. ""inimesed viisid kogemata"" (people transferred without experiencing) vs ""which people accidentally moved"" - The machine translation omits the ""kogemata"" (without experiencing), which changes the meaning slightly, suggesting a movement without awareness rather than an accidental transfer.
4. ""jasmiinilt üle tulpidele"" (from jasmine to tulips) vs ""from jasmins to tulips"" - The source and reference translations use the same phrase, while the machine translation omits the ""üle"" (from), making the destination less clear.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in terms of the interpretation of ""triipe"" as ""tribal acid"", the inclusion of ""kogemata"", and the structure of the sentence regarding the movement from jasmine to tulips.

**Analysis:**

1. **""Ühtlasi võttis ta sõna""** (Source) vs. **""He also spoke about the issues of joining Russia in Crimea""** (Machine Translation) - The machine translation omits the context of ""Krimmi Venemaaga ühendamise"" (literally, ""with Russia in Crimea""), which is crucial for understanding the topic. It should be translated as ""the unification of Crimea with Russia.""

2. **""väites, et see toimus demokraatlikul teel""** (Source) vs. **""claiming that it was on a democratic path""** (Machine Translation) - The machine translation captures the idea of making a claim but loses the direct quote (""väites"") and the structure of the sentence, which in Estonian implies a statement made by the speaker. The reference translation rephrases this as ""claiming that it took place in a democratic way,"" which is more accurate in conveying the meaning.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in:

3. **Reference translation**: President of Guinea, Lansana Conté, dismissed Prime Minister Eugène Camara and promised to appoint a new Prime Minister acceptable to trade unions.

**Analysis**:
- The machine translation captures the main points: President Lansana Conté, Prime Minister Eugène Camara, release, and appointment of a new Prime Minister acceptable to trade unions.
- However, there is a difference in the verb used to describe the action towards Prime Minister Camara. The source uses ""vabastas"" (released), while the machine translation uses ""released"" (which is a more general term). The reference translation uses ""dismissed,"" which is a more accurate term in this context, as it implies the removal from office.
- The reference translation also omits the word ""ja lubas"" (and promised) in the source, which is not essential to convey the main idea but adds additional information about the president's commitment.

Overall, the machine translation is accurate in terms of conveying the main event but loses some nuance by using a less specific term for the action towards Prime Minister Camara and omits the additional information about the president's promise.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Sellist väärtust nimetatakse seesmiseks väärtuseks.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: This value is called an internal value.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: This value is called intrinsic value.

Step 4: Compare the translations
- The source text mentions ""sellist väärtust"" which refers to ""the value related to something"" or ""the value inherent in something"". The word ""sellist"" is specific to Estonian and might not have a direct equivalent in English, but it implies a connection to the context of sale or inherent worth.
- The machine translation translates ""sellist väärtust"" as ""an internal value"", which is a possible interpretation but not the most precise one, as ""internal"" usually refers to something within a system or organization, whereas ""sellist"" suggests a more inherent or built-in quality.
- The reference translation uses ""intrinsic value"", which is a more accurate term to convey the idea of the value being inherent or built-in, as it directly relates to the source text's concept.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it uses ""internal value"" instead of ""intrinsic value"", which is a less precise and potentially less idiomatic translation of the Estonian term ""sellist väärtust"". The reference translation better captures the essence of the source text by emphasizing the inherent nature of the value.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
The reference translation is: ""thumbright166px [ [ Jan Klemens Branicki followed Józef Potock as Crown Hetman .""

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""crown moment"" which is not a standard phrase in this context. The reference translation uses ""Crown Hetman,"" which is a more accurate term for the historical position.
- The machine translation omits the square brackets around ""Jan Klemens Branicki"" in the reference, which might indicate a formatting issue or a misunderstanding of the source text.
- The machine translation has ""Queright"" instead of ""thumbright166px,"" which is likely a typographical error or a misinterpretation of the source's image description.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, specifically in the term ""crown moment"" being replaced with ""Crown Hetman"" and the handling of the image description. The machine translation also omits the square brackets around the name, which is important for clarity. The overall quality of the translation could be improved by using more precise and contextually appropriate terms and maintaining the formatting of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Oli ette teada, et Euwe kaotab tahtlikult ja oli ette teada, et Botvinnik kaotab tahtlikult.
Machine translation: It was known in advance that Euwe would lose intentionally and had known in advance that Botvinnik would lose intentionally.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two.
- The machine translation adds ""had known"" after ""Botvinnik"" which is not present in the source text.

Step 3: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
Reference translation: It was known in advance that Euwe would lose intentionally and it was known in advance that Botvinnik would lose intentionally.

Step 4: Analyze the difference.
- The reference translation maintains the parallel structure by using ""it was known"" for both Euwe and Botvinnik, while the machine translation adds ""had known"" for Botvinnik, which changes the tense.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the tense of the second part, where the reference uses simple past (""was known"") for both subjects, while the machine translation uses past perfect (""had known""). This difference affects the clarity and parallelism of the sentence. The correct translation should match the reference, which maintains the same tense for both Euwe and Botvinnik.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: Riks tuleb Mornasse Mare päranduse kohta Allanilt infot saama.
- Machine translation: Riks Mornasse Mare has to receive information from Allana on her succession.

Step 2: Identify differences in structure and word choice.
- In the source, ""tuleb"" (comes) is translated as ""has to receive"" in the machine translation, which is a correct verb to convey the action.
- ""Mornasse Mare päranduse"" (Mare's bequest at Mornasse) is translated as ""her succession"" in the machine translation, but it omits the location ""Mornasse"" and changes the word order.

Step 3: Analyze the impact on meaning.
- The main difference is the location ""Mornasse,"" which is crucial for understanding the context. The machine translation loses this information, making it less clear where the information is being sought.

Step 4: Compare with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: Riks comes to Morna to receive information from Allan about Mare 's bequest.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality.
- The machine translation captures the general idea but loses the specific context provided by the source text. The reference translation more accurately reflects the original meaning by including ""Morna"" and maintaining the structure.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of losing the location ""Mornasse,"" which is important for understanding the context. The reference translation provides a more accurate and faithful representation of the source text.

|source| Rauaaja lõpu osas võib teha veidi kindlamaid oletusi ka muinaseestlaste uskumuste kohta, tuginedes enamasti Henriku Liivimaa kroonikale.|
|machine_translation| A slightly firmer assumption can also be made about the end of the island's history, based, for the most part, on the chronicon of Henriu Libya.|
|reference_translation| With regard to the end of the Iron Age, slightly firmer assumptions can also be made about the beliefs of ancient Estonians, based, for the most part, on the Livonian Chronicle of Henry.|

Analysis:
1. **Iron Age vs. island's history**: The source text refers to ""rauaaja lõpus"" (the end of the Iron Age), while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the island's history."" The reference translation correctly captures the context of the Iron Age.
2. **muinaseestlaste uskumuste kohta** (about the beliefs of ancient Estonians): The machine translation omits the word ""Estonians"" and instead uses ""Henriu Libya,"" which is a confusion. The reference translation includes ""ancient Estonians"" and refers to ""Henry"" as the author of the Livonian Chronicle.
3. **Livonia vs. Henriku Liivimaa**: The source text refers to ""Liivimaa kroonikale"" (the chronicle of Liivimaa/Livonia), which is a specific region. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""chronicon of Henriu Libya,"" which is a confusion of names. The reference translation correctly uses ""Livonian Chronicle of Henry.""

In summary, the machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the context of the Iron Age, the reference to ancient Estonians, and the proper attribution to the chronicle. The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation.

|Machine translation: The first lasting newspaper was the Crier Polski, which was published in 1729 by the peasants and then the thiresudes.|
|Reference translation: The first permanent newspaper was Kurier Polski, which was published since 1729 by the Piarists and then by the Jesuits.|

Analysis:
1. **""Esimene püsiv ajaleht""** (First permanent newspaper) - Machine translation: ""The first lasting newspaper"" is a close approximation but not as precise as ""permanent"" in the reference translation.
2. **""oli Kurier Polski""** (was Kurier Polski) - Both translations are the same.
3. **""mida 1729. aastast avaldasid""** (which were published in 1729) - Machine translation: ""which was published in 1729"" is accurate.
4. **""piaristid ja siis jesuiidid""** (the Piarists and then the Jesuits) - Machine translation: ""the peasants and then the thiresudes"" is incorrect. ""Piaristid"" refers to the Piarist order, and ""jesuiidid"" refers to the Jesuits. The machine translation mistranslates these terms.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- It uses ""lasting"" instead of ""permanent"" to describe the newspaper, which is less precise.
- It incorrectly translates ""piaristid"" as ""peasants"" and ""jesuiidid"" as ""thiresudes,"" which are not accurate.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should be revised to: ""The first permanent newspaper was Kurier Polski, which was published in 1729 by the Piarists and then by the Jesuits.""

|Analysis|
1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation are identical in terms of the sentence structure and content.
2. The source text uses ""Ürituse korraldasid"" which means ""organized"" or ""held"" the event, and ""Eesti Kirjastuste Liit"" for ""Association of Estonian Publishers"" and ""firma Taveco Disain"" for ""Taveco Design"" (assuming ""Disain"" is a typo and should be ""Design"").
3. The machine translation accurately captures the meaning and names of the organizations involved.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is of high quality in this case, as it closely matches the reference translation and conveys the same information without any significant errors or differences in meaning. The only potential issue is the typo in ""Dseain"" which should be corrected to ""Design"" in the machine translation.

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the source text
- Stuartite ajal (during the Stuarts' period)
- lisatud suurtükiplatvormid (added large platforms)
- olid juba lagunenud (had already collapsed)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""Large stem platforms included in the Students' maps had already collapsed.""
- Reference translation: ""The artillery platforms, which were added during the Stuarts' period, had already collapsed.""

Step 3: Analyze differences
- The machine translation uses ""Large stem platforms"" which is not accurate. The reference translation specifies ""artillery platforms,"" which is more contextually relevant.
- The reference translation includes the phrase ""which were added during the Stuarts' period"" to provide context, while the machine translation omits this detail, making it less clear.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity (artillery platforms vs. large stem platforms) and context (mentioning the time period). The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate translation by including the type of platforms and the time frame.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Frankfurti järgi tuleneb see hoopis sellest, et vanemad armastavad oma lapse väga.
Machine translation: Instead, according to Frankfurt, it is because parents very much love their children.

The machine translation has the following differences:
- ""Frankfurgi järgi"" is translated as ""According to Frankfurt"", which is correct but placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the source, it is a postpositional phrase.
- ""tuleneb see"" is translated as ""it is because"", which is accurate.
- ""hoopis"" is translated as ""very much"", which conveys the intensity of the love.
- ""sellest"" is translated as ""of this"" or ""because of this"", but it's implied in ""it is because"" and not explicitly stated.
- ""et vanemad armastavad oma lapse väga"" is translated as ""parents very much love their children"", which is correct.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: Instead, according to Frankfurt, it is because parents very much love their children.
Reference translation: Instead , according to Frankfurt , it is because parents very much love their children .

The differences between the machine and reference translations are minor:
- The comma after ""Instead"" is missing in the machine translation, but it's a minor punctuation difference.

Conclusion: The machine translation captures the essence of the source text, with the main ideas being accurately translated. The differences are mainly in punctuation and sentence structure, which are less critical for understanding the meaning. The translation is of good quality overall, with some minor adjustments needed for a more natural-sounding English.

|Reference translation: That is why, in Tărnovo, the power transferred to Ivan Stefan, the eldest son of the dead Tsar by his Serbian wife, who was overthrown after short rule.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""tsaari vanem poeg"" (the dead Tsar's eldest son), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""parent son of the dead Chamber"". This is a mistranslation, as ""tsaari"" refers to the Tsar and not a chamber.
2. The reference translation correctly identifies Ivan Stefan as the eldest son of the dead Tsar, while the machine translation omits this detail, making it less clear about Ivan's relationship to the Tsar.
3. The source text uses ""tema Serbia abikaasaga"" (his Serbian wife), which is translated as ""his Serbian wife"" in both the machine and reference translations, but the context is clear in the reference translation.
4. The phrase ""kes kukutati pärast lühikest valitsemist"" (who was overthrown after short rule) is translated accurately in both the machine and reference translations.

Overall, the machine translation has a few inaccuracies, particularly in identifying Ivan Stefan as the Tsar's eldest son and the confusion with the ""tsaari"" and ""Chamber"" terms. The reference translation is clearer and more faithful to the source text.

1. **""nõuab mingeid piiranguid""** (Source) vs. **""require some limitations""** (Machine Translation): The machine translation omits the word ""mingeid"" (some) in English, which is important to convey the idea that there are specific or certain limitations.

2. **""tundub, et""** (Source) vs. **""also seems to""** (Machine Translation): The machine translation uses ""also seems to"" instead of ""tundub, et"" (it seems that), which changes the emphasis slightly. The original Estonian suggests a stronger feeling or impression, while the machine translation is more neutral.

3. **""nähtavasti""** (Source) vs. **""obviously""** (Machine Translation): The machine translation uses ""obviously"" to translate ""nähtavasti,"" which is a direct translation but loses the nuance of the original Estonian, which implies a more evident or clear conclusion.

4. **""välistada""** (Source) vs. **""be excluded""** (Machine Translation): The machine translation correctly translates the verb ""välistada"" (to exclude) as ""be excluded,"" but it is not connected to the word ""obviously"" in the same way as in the reference translation, which makes the sentence structure slightly different.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in the choice of words, emphasis, and sentence structure that affect the overall meaning and nuance of the original Estonian text. The reference translation better captures the meaning and tone of the source text.

|Reference translation: Reflexion only comes into play at a second stage, if the mind grasps the relationship that it caused.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Refleksioon""** (Reflection) - The machine translation uses ""Reflexony"", which is a misspelling or incorrect word choice. The reference translation uses ""Reflexion"", which is a more accurate term for reflection in English.
2. **""mängu""** (game) - The machine translation omits this word, which is crucial for understanding the context. In the reference translation, it is translated as ""mind"", which is a more appropriate translation in this context.
3. **""teises staadiumis""** (at a second stage) - Both translations convey this idea correctly.
4. **""kui aru saab""** (when understanding) - The machine translation uses ""if one realises"", which is a close but not exact match. The reference translation uses ""if the mind grasps"", which is more precise and idiomatic.

|Reference translation: The central government has announced that it has taken control of the city of Artemivsk in the Lugansk region.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""Luganski oblastis asuva Artemivski linna"" (Lugansk region-based Artemivski city), which refers to the city located within the Lugansk Oblast.
2. The machine translation correctly identifies ""Lugansk Oblast"" but uses ""city of Artemivski, based in"" instead of specifying the region. This results in a slightly awkward phrasing.
3. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses ""Lugansk region"" to convey the same idea, which is more concise and accurate.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the way it specifies the location of Artemivsk. While the machine translation is not incorrect, it could be improved by using ""in the Lugansk region"" instead of ""based in the Lugansk Oblast"" to match the reference translation more closely.

- Machine translation: Numerous proportions do not always have to be the focus of sight; they need to receive enough attention.

Difference: The machine translation has changed ""Armastatu"" (the loved one) to ""Numerous proportions"" and ""nägemisvälja keskmes"" (the centre of the field of vision) to ""the focus of sight"". This is a significant deviation from the source text.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: Numerous proportions do not always have to be the focus of sight; they need to receive enough attention.
- Reference translation: The loved one does not always have to be in the centre of the field of vision; they need to receive enough attention.

Difference: The machine translation continues to use ""Numerous proportions"" instead of ""The loved one"" (Armastatu), which is a crucial aspect of the original meaning. Additionally, ""nägemisvälja keskmes"" is translated as ""in the centre of the field of vision"" in the reference, which is a more accurate translation than ""the focus of sight.""

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the subject matter (mistaking ""Armastatu"" for ""Numerous proportions"") and the specific phrase ""nägemisvälja keskmes"" (field of vision vs. focus of sight).

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""Šveitsis Genfis"" which refers to ""Geneva, Switzerland"" in English. The machine translation correctly translates ""Šveitsis"" to ""Switzerland"" but omits the location name ""Genfis"" or ""Geneva"" after it.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The idea is one of the oldest in the region and, in 1396, Hincke bought there in addition to three villages.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The manor is one of the oldest in the region and, in 1396, Hincke expanded it by buying three more villages.

Step 4: Compare the source and machine translation
- In the source, ""Mõis"" refers to a manor, not an ""idea"" as in the machine translation.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""sinna juurde veel lisaks"" as ""there in addition to,"" which implies a separate action. The reference translation correctly interprets this phrase as ""expanded it by buying"" to indicate the addition of the villages to the manor.

Step 5: Compare the machine and reference translation
- The machine translation refers to ""Hincke bought there"" while the reference translation says ""Hincke expanded it by buying,"" which is a more accurate representation of the source's meaning.

Step 2: Identify differences in structure and vocabulary.
- The source uses ""kaitse vasakul äärel"" (left wing of the protection) while the machine translation uses ""on the left of Durutte"" which is a less precise translation of the location.
- The source mentions ""üksused karreedesse seada"" (units formed into squares), while the machine translation omits this detail, using ""carpet its units"" which does not convey the same meaning.
- The source refers to ""Šoti Hallide"" (Scottish Halls), while the machine translation uses ""Scottish Halls"" without the possessive form.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: ""On the left wing of Wellington 's defence, the Durutte division had time to form itself into squares and defend itself from the Scotch Halls.""

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The reference translation captures the left wing of Wellington's defense more accurately, using ""left wing"" instead of ""on the left of Durutte.""
- It includes the formation of units into squares, ""form itself into squares,"" which is a more accurate description of the action.
- The possessive form ""Scottish Halls"" in the reference translation is consistent with the source, while the machine translation omits it.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of location description, the formation of units, and the possessive form of ""Scottish Halls."" The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

|im_start|>|im_sep|>|ref|: The new government no longer includes representatives of the Islamic movement Hamas.|>|mt|: The new government no longer includes representatives of the Islamic movement in Hamas.|>|analysis|:

1. **Omission of ""in"":** The machine translation omits the preposition ""in"" after ""Islamic movement,"" which is present in the reference translation. This might be a minor difference, as it's common to omit prepositions in some languages when translating.

2. **Placement of ""Hamas"":** In the reference translation, ""Hamas"" is placed immediately after ""Islamic movement,"" indicating that it is a specific movement. The machine translation separates ""Hamas"" with a prepositional phrase ""in Hamas,"" which might imply a slightly broader context or a focus on the organization rather than the movement itself.

3. **Capitalization: ** The reference translation capitalizes ""Hamas,"" which is the proper noun referring to the organization. The machine translation does not capitalize it, which might be an error or a stylistic choice, but proper nouns should generally be capitalized in English.

4. **Sentence structure: ** The reference translation has a more straightforward sentence structure, while the machine translation adds a slight complexity with the prepositional phrase. This might affect the clarity of the sentence for non-native speakers.

Overall, the machine translation is quite close to the reference translation, with the main differences being the preposition ""in"" and the placement of ""Hamas."" The capitalization and sentence structure are minor issues that could be addressed for a more accurate translation.

|Source: Eesti pealinnas Tallinnas Estonia kontserdisaalis toimus moedisainerite konkursi SuperNoova võitjate autasustamine.|
|Machine translation: The Estonian capital, Tallinn, Estonia's group competition for designers, SuperNoorva, was awarded a prize.|
|Reference translation: The winners of the SuperNoova competition of fashion designers were awarded their prizes in the Estonia Concert Hall in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.|

|Analysis|
1. **""Eesti pealinnas Tallinnas""** (In the Estonian capital, Tallinn) - Machine translation: ""The Estonian capital, Tallinn"" (correctly translated the location)
2. **""Estonia kontserdisaalis""** (Estonia concert hall) - Machine translation: ""Estonia's group competition for designers"" (misinterpreted the context, should be ""concert hall"")
3. **""moedisainerite konkursi""** (fashion designers' competition) - Machine translation: ""group competition for designers"" (missed the specific type, ""fashion designers"")
4. **""SuperNoova võitjate autasustamine""** (awarding the winners of SuperNoova) - Machine translation: ""was awarded a prize"" (translated the action but not the context, should be ""awarding the winners"")

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several aspects. It incorrectly interprets the ""Estonia kontserdisaalis"" as a group competition for designers instead of a concert hall, misses the specific type of competition (fashion designers), and does not convey the act of awarding the winners. The correct translation should be: ""The winners of the SuperNoova fashion designers' competition were awarded their prizes at the Estonia Concert Hall in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.""

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start| Analyzing the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. **Source text**: ""Tuuakse välja, et kõik voolab, kuid mitte seda, et see toimub muutumatu jumaliku maailmaolemuse alusel, välja ei tooda.""
   - Machine translation: ""It is pointed out that everything is flowing, but not that it takes place on the basis of an unchanging god of the world is produced.""
   - Reference translation: ""It is pointed out that everything is flowing, but not that it takes place on the basis of an unchanging godly being of the world, which is not pointed out.""

2. **Difference 1**: The machine translation uses ""god of the world is produced"" instead of ""godly being of the world"" in the reference translation. This change alters the meaning, suggesting that something is being produced by the unchanging god, whereas the reference implies that the existence or functioning of the world is based on this unchanging divine being, which is not explicitly mentioned.

3. **Difference 2**: The reference translation includes the phrase ""which is not pointed out"" at the end, which clarifies that the unchanging godly being is not the focus of the statement. The machine translation omits this part, making the meaning slightly ambiguous.

4. **Difference 3**: The word order in the machine translation is slightly different, which can affect the flow and emphasis of the sentence, but it does not change the core meaning as much as the differences mentioned above.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific reference to the unchanging godly being and the clarification that this being is not the main point. The machine translation also omits the additional information about what is not being pointed out, which affects the overall clarity of the translated sentence.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""Nicolausel olid olemas mõned Proklose teosed, millel on arvukalt ääremärkusi.""
- Machine translation: ""Nicosia had some Proklos' works, with numerous peripheral comments.""

Difference 1: The source text mentions ""Nicolausel"" (referring to a place or person named Nicolaus), while the machine translation refers to ""Nicosia,"" which is a city in Cyprus, not related to the context. This is a significant difference.

Difference 2: The source uses ""mõned"" (some), which is the correct word for ""some"" in this context. The machine translation uses ""numerous,"" which is not a direct translation and implies a greater quantity than necessary.

Difference 3: The source has ""ääremärkusi"" (marginal notes), while the machine translation uses ""peripheral comments,"" which might not convey the same meaning as marginal notes, which are typically found in the margins of a text.

Step 2: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
- Source: ""Nicolausel olid olemas mõned Proklose teosed, millel on arvukalt ääremärkusi.""
- Reference translation: ""Nicolaus had some of Proclos 's works with numerous marginal notes.""

Difference 4: The reference translation correctly translates ""Nicolausel"" as ""Nicolaus"" (omitting the ""el"" which is not needed in this context).

Difference 5: The reference translation uses ""some of Proclos's works"" to convey the same meaning as ""mõned Proklose teosed,"" which is more accurate than the machine translation.

Difference 6: The reference translation uses ""marginal notes"" directly, which is a more precise term than ""peripheral comments"" in this context.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the incorrect identification of ""Nicolausel"" as a city, the choice of words ""numerous peripheral comments"" instead of ""marginal notes,"" and the overall structure of the sentence. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text and conveys the meaning more accurately.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
- Source: ""17. sajandiks oli arvu mõiste tunduvalt laienenud.""
- Machine translation: ""For the 17th century, the definition of the number had expanded considerably.""
- Reference translation: ""By the 17th century, the definition of the number had expanded considerably.""

The source sentence starts with ""17. sajandiks"" (literally ""in the 17th century""), which is translated to ""For the 17th century"" in the machine translation and ""By the 17th century"" in the reference translation. Both convey the same meaning but with a slight difference in phrasing.

Step 2: Analyze the verb and adverb
- Source: ""oli"" (was) + ""tunduvalt"" (significantly) + ""laienenud"" (expanded)
- Machine translation: ""had expanded"" (implied from ""expanded considerably"")
- Reference translation: ""had expanded"" (implied from ""expanded considerably"")

The machine translation omits the adverb ""tunduvalt"" (significantly), which is important to convey the degree of expansion. The reference translation includes it, making the translation more precise.

Step 3: Check for missing or extra words
- Machine translation: No extra or missing words.
- Reference translation: No extra or missing words.

The reference translation is faithful to the source text, with no additional or missing words.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it omits the adverb ""tunduvalt"" (significantly), which is crucial to convey the extent of the expansion. The sentence structure is similar, but the reference translation provides a more accurate and natural translation by including the adverb.

|Reference translation: The Estonian Minister for Social Affairs, Hanno Pevkur, was on a one-day working visit to Finland, where he met several members of the Finnish Government.|
|Analysis:|
1. The source text mentions ""ühepäevasel töövisiidil"" (one-day working visit), which is correctly translated as ""on a one-day working visit"" in both the machine and reference translations.
2. The subject, ""Eesti sotsiaalminister Hanno Pevkur,"" is the same in both translations, referring to the Estonian Minister for Social Affairs.
3. The main action ""viibis"" (visited) is translated as ""was on"" in both, which is appropriate for the context.
4. The difference lies in the pronoun ""kohtus mitmete Soome valitsuse liikmetega"" (met several members of the Finnish Government), which in the machine translation is simply ""where several members of the Finnish Government met."" In the reference translation, the pronoun ""he"" is added before ""met"" to make it clear that the action is performed by Hanno Pevkur, the subject of the sentence.

To improve the machine translation, the correct pronoun ""he"" should be included to clarify that Hanno Pevkur is the one meeting the Finnish government members:

|Reference translation: In Estonia, the Tallinn University Institute for History launched the 10th Conference of Estonian Modern History under the title ""Revolutions and Estonia.""|

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""Eestis"" (in Estonia), which is correctly translated as ""In Estonia"" in both the machine and reference translations.
2. ""Tallinna Ülikooli Ajaloo Instituudis"" (at the Tallinn University Institute for History) is translated accurately as ""the Tallinn University Institute for History"" in both versions.
3. ""algas kümnes"" (began with) is translated as ""launched the"" in both, which is a suitable equivalent.
4. ""Eesti moodsa ajaloo"" (Estonian modern history) is translated as ""Estonian Modern History"" in both, which is a correct adaptation of the term.
5. ""konverents pealkirja all"" (under the conference title) is translated as ""under the title"" in both, conveying the same meaning.
6. The title ""Revolutsioonid ja Eesti"" (Revolutions and Estonia) is identical in both the machine and reference translations.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality and closely matches the reference translation. The differences are minor and do not affect the overall meaning or clarity of the sentence. The only potential improvement might be to add a comma after ""Estonia"" in the title to match the punctuation in the source text, but this is a minor detail.

|Reference translation: By the middle of the 16th century, the Polish university, the Academy of Kraków had reached a crisis, and at the beginning of the 17th century retreated into the conformist of the Counter-Reformation.|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation has an error in the phrase ""reversal of the Reforms of Reforms of Reformation."" The reference translation uses ""taandus vastureformatsiooni konformismi"" which means ""retreated into the conformist of the Counter-Reformation."" The machine translation incorrectly translates this as a ""reversal"" of reforms, which does not convey the same meaning as the retreat into conformity.
2. The source text specifies ""17. sajandi alguses"" (at the beginning of the 17th century), which the machine translation accurately captures. However, the reference translation uses ""Counter-Reformation"" to provide context for the retreat, which is not directly translated in the machine translation.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its incorrect interpretation of the retreat into conformity as a ""reversal of reforms"" and the lack of explicit mention of the Counter-Reformation in the translated text. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the original meaning.

|Analysis|
1. The source text starts with ""Maailmapank kiitis heaks"", which means ""The World Bank approved"" in English. The machine translation correctly captures this as ""The World Bank has approved"".
2. The source mentions ""12 miljardi USA dollari suuruse laenu"" (a USD 12 billion loan), which is accurately translated as ""a USD 12 billion loan"" in both the machine and reference translations.

4. The part ""mis makstakse välja viie aasta jooksul"" means ""which will be paid out within five years"", which is also translated the same way in both the machine and reference translations.

3. However, the machine translation uses ""appointed Minister for Social Affairs"" instead of ""appointed as Minister for Social Affairs,"" which is a minor difference in phrasing but does not change the meaning.

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""sattumise kartuses"" (fear of falling into) or ""külast Donetski suunas"" (visiting Donetski direction), which implies a movement towards the area, not necessarily entering a siege.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""sattumise kartuses"" as ""for fear of entering the siege,"" which suggests a more definitive act of entering a besieged area, rather than the initial fear of approaching it.
3. The reference translation captures the idea of ""being surrounded"" more accurately, which is a more plausible fear for the separatists in this context.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the source text, specifically in the description of the fear. The machine translation suggests a fear of entering a siege, while the reference translation correctly conveys the fear of being surrounded, which is a more plausible concern given the context of the source.

|mt|: What, then, does Kant consider to be a commitment of happiness?|
|diff| The machine translation differs from the reference translation in a few ways:

1. **Word choice**: The reference translation uses ""mean by"" to convey the idea of what Kant's concept or definition is, while the machine translation uses ""consider to be,"" which implies an evaluation or understanding rather than a definition.

2. **Term translation**: ""Duty of happiness"" is a more accurate and idiomatic translation than ""commitment of happiness"" in this context. The term ""duty"" better captures the moral or philosophical obligation Kant is likely referring to, whereas ""commitment"" could imply a personal or emotional obligation rather than a moral one.

3. **Punctuation**: The reference translation has a comma after ""then,"" which is common in English to separate introductory phrases. The machine translation omits this comma, but it's a minor difference that doesn't significantly alter the meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is close but not identical to the reference translation, with the main difference being the choice of words and the more precise term ""duty"" instead of ""commitment.""|

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
|Source: Sellest tulebki, et mõned eesmärgid on toimingud ja teised on esemed, mis on toimingutest eraldi.|
|Machine translation: This means that some objectives are actions and others are objects that are separate from activities.|
|Reference translation: This means that some objectives are actions and others are objects that are separate from actions.|

|Analysis:|
1. The source text in Estonian mentions ""toimingutest eraldi,"" which translates to ""from activities"" in English. The machine translation has ""activities,"" while the reference translation has ""actions."" The difference here is that ""toimingud"" (actions) is a more specific term than ""activites,"" as it implies a more intentional and purposeful action, whereas ""activities"" could refer to a broader range of actions or processes.

2. The reference translation adds the word ""actions"" after ""objects that are separate from,"" which clarifies that the objects are distinct from the specific actions, not just any activities. The machine translation omits this distinction, which slightly changes the meaning.

|Conclusion:|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it uses ""activities"" instead of ""actions,"" which may dilute the specificity of the source text. The reference translation provides a clearer distinction between objectives being separate from actions, rather than just any activities. To improve the quality, the machine translation should be revised to say, ""This means that some objectives are actions and others are objects that are separate from actions.""|im_end|

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
- Source: ""Hispaania keeldus aga Portugali iseseisvust tunnistamast ja nii puhkes detsembris 1640 Portugali iseseisvussõda, mis kestis kuni 1668. aastani.""
- Machine translation: ""However, Spain refused to recognise Portugal's independence and so the 1640 Portuguese War of Independence broke out in December, which lasted until 1668.""
- Reference translation: ""However , Spain refused to recognise Portugal 's independence and so the Portuguese War of Independence broke out in December 1640 , which lasted until 1668.""

The machine translation adds ""the"" before ""1640"" and omits the comma after ""December"" in the reference translation. This changes the date format and slightly affects the flow of the sentence.

Step 2: Check for accuracy of key terms
- ""Hispaania keeldus"" (Spanish refusal) vs ""Spain refused""
- ""Portugali iseseisvust"" (Portuguese independence) vs ""Portugal's independence""
- ""detsembris 1640"" (December 1640) vs ""December 1640""
- ""Portugali iseseisvussõda"" (Portuguese War of Independence) vs ""Portuguese War of Independence""
- ""kuni 1668. aastani"" (until 1668) vs ""which lasted until 1668""

The key terms are translated accurately, but the date format and punctuation are different in the machine translation.

Step 3: Evaluate the overall meaning
The machine translation conveys the main idea that Spain refused to recognize Portugal's independence, leading to the war that began in December 1640 and lasted until 1668. However, the differences in sentence structure and date format might cause a slight variation in readability for a native English speaker.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is generally accurate in terms of meaning, but it loses some nuance in the sentence structure and date presentation compared to the reference translation. The reference translation is clearer and more idiomatic in English, with the date format being more standard.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
Both the machine translation and the reference translation have the same sentence structure, with the subject implied and the main focus on the actions of choosing and the two aspects (cultural development and historical individuality).

Step 2: Check for word-for-word correspondence
The words in the machine translation closely match the reference translation, with only minor differences in capitalization (e.g., ""Ja"" in the source is lowercase in both translations, and ""it"" is implied in both).

Step 3: Analyze differences in phrasing
The machine translation uses ""what is important to"" instead of ""millel on tähtsust"" in the source. This is a rephrasing that captures the same meaning but with a slightly different emphasis. The phrase ""and what is a historical individuality"" is directly translated in both.

Step 4: Check for accuracy and clarity
The meaning of the source text is preserved in the machine translation, though the phrasing is slightly different. The reference translation is clear and concise, and the machine translation conveys the same information.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in emphasis. The main ideas are preserved, and the overall quality of the translation is good. The main difference is the choice of phrasing, which might slightly alter the emphasis but does not change the core meaning.

|im_start|>

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: Kuri, mida ta oli teinud, avanes Raskolnikovile kahetsuses, mis aga või saada mitmeti rikutud.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The evil that he had done opened up to Raskolthnic in regret, which has, however, been or has been, in many ways violated.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The evil that he had done appeared to Raskolnikov in regret, which could have been ruined in many ways.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""opened up to Raskolthnic"" instead of ""appeared to Raskolnikov"". This is a difference in verb choice and proper noun accuracy.
- The machine translation adds ""in regret"" after ""opened up to"", which is present in the source but not explicitly stated in the reference translation. It's a possible addition to convey the same meaning.
- The machine translation uses ""which has, however, been or has been"" instead of ""which could have been"". This changes the meaning from a potential past condition to a present or past completed action.
- The machine translation adds ""in many ways violated"" instead of ""ruined in many ways"". This changes the focus from the possibility of the evil being ruined to the idea of it being violated.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of verb choice, proper noun accuracy, and the interpretation of the regret and the potential consequences. The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately, expressing regret for the evil done and the potential for it to have been ruined, while the machine translation introduces additional details and changes the meaning slightly.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Edgar Savisaar, Mayor of Tallinn, broke a leg while feeding birds at his home farm, Hundisilma.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""linde toites jalaluu"" (feeding birds with his foot) as ""broke a shoe in his farm in Hundisilmal's food."" The reference translation correctly understands this as ""broke a leg while feeding birds.""
- The source mentions ""kodutalus"" (home farm), which is not directly translated in the machine translation, but it is implied in the reference translation with ""his home farm.""
- The source includes ""Hundisilmal"" as a location, which is translated as ""in Hundisilmal's"" in the machine translation, but it is more accurately placed at the end of the sentence in the reference translation.

Conclusion:
The machine translation has differences in the interpretation of the action (feeding birds vs. breaking a shoe) and the structure of the sentence, which affects the clarity and accuracy of the translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the source text.

Analysis:
1. The source text is in Estonian, and the machine translation and reference translation are both in English.
2. The subject ""Guineas"" in the source is translated as ""In Guinea"" in both machine and reference, which is correct as it refers to the country.
3. ""teatas"" (announcement) is translated as ""announced"" in both, which is accurate.
4. ""tagasiastumisest"" (about returning) is translated as ""his resignation"" in both, but it's a bit ambiguous in English. The reference translation omits this part, which might be a simplification or a choice to convey the main point without additional context.
5. ""peaminister"" (prime minister) is translated as ""Prime Minister"" in both, which is correct.
6. ""Mohamed Said Fofana"" is the same name in both translations, so there's no issue there.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor loss of context regarding the reason for the resignation (omitted ""tagasiastumisest""). The structure and key information are consistent with the reference translation. The main difference lies in the choice to include or not the phrase ""about returning"" in the translation, which might affect the interpretation slightly.

- Machine translation: ""In Estonia, a preliminary vote on the elections for the National Assembly for 2007 began in land centres and external representations.""

Differences:
- ""maakonnakeskustes"" (county centres) is translated as ""land centres"", which is not an exact match. ""Maakonnakeskus"" specifically refers to county administrative centres in Estonian.
- ""välisesindustes"" (foreign missions) is translated as ""external representations"", which is a general term but does not convey the specific meaning of Estonian ""välisesindus"" which refers to diplomatic missions abroad.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""In Estonia, a preliminary vote on the elections for the National Assembly for 2007 began in land centres and external representations.""
- Reference translation: ""In Estonia, a preliminary vote in the 2007 election for the Riigikogu began in county centres and foreign missions.""

Differences:
- The reference translation specifies ""Riigikogu"" (National Assembly), which is not included in the machine translation. This is important context for understanding the context of the vote.
- The reference translation uses ""county centres"" and ""foreign missions"" directly, which are more accurate translations of the original source.

Conclusion:
The machine translation has some differences from the reference translation, particularly in the translation of ""maakonnakeskustes"" and ""välisesindustes"" and the lack of mention of ""Riigikogu.""

|Analysis:|
1. **""Rootsi säilitas enamuse Liivimaast""** (Machine) vs. **""Sweden retained the majority of Livonia""** (Reference): The machine translation uses ""the Union"" instead of ""Livonia"", which is a historical region, not a union. The reference translation is more accurate in this context.
2. **""Rzeczpospolita hoidis Kuramaad""** (Machine) vs. **""Rzeczpospolita held Kurland""** (Reference): Both translations are correct, but the reference specifies ""Kurland"" instead of ""Kuramaad"", which is likely a typo or a less common term.

Step 1: Identify the key terms and phrases in the source text.
- ""Kindlasti"" (Certainly)
- ""oli tegelik liikide arv"" (the actual number of species)
- ""oluliselt suurem"" (significantly higher)
- ""hinnanguliselt"" (estimated)
- ""maailma seeneliikidest"" (world's mushroom species)
- ""tänaseks avastatud"" (discovered to date)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""The actual number of species is certainly significantly higher, as it is estimated that only about 7% of the world's pig species have been detected to date.""
- Reference translation: ""The actual number of species is certainly significantly higher, as it is estimated that only about 7% of the world 's mushroom species have been discovered to date.""

Difference analysis:
- ""seeneliikidest"" (world's mushroom species) in the source is translated to ""pig species"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect.
- ""avastatud"" (discovered) in the source is translated to ""detected"" in the machine translation, which is a suitable term but loses the specificity of mushrooms.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the specific term ""seeneliikidest"" (mushroom species), which is incorrectly translated as ""pig species.""

- Machine translation: Air temperatures will be around 30 °C in the summer, and temperatures may fall to 5 °C over winter.

The machine translation captures the main points from the source text: mentioning 30 °C in summer and a possible temperature drop to 5 °C in winter. However, there are a few differences:

1. The source text uses ""õhutemperatuur"" (air temperature) directly, while the machine translation translates it as ""Air temperatures"" (plural and capitalized). This is a minor difference, as the meaning is the same.

2. The source text uses ""ringis"" (around) without a space, while the machine translation adds a space, resulting in ""around 30 °C"". This is a formatting issue and does not affect the meaning.

3. The source text includes ""võib temperatuur langeda viie kraadini"" (temperatures may fall by five degrees), while the machine translation omits the phrase ""langeda viie kraadini"" and simply says ""temperatures may fall to 5 °C"". This is a loss of nuance, as the source specifies a drop of five degrees, not just a final temperature.

4. The source text uses a comma after ""suvel"" (summer) to separate it from the following clause, while the machine translation omits this comma. This is a minor punctuation difference.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: Air temperatures will be around 30 °C in the summer, and temperatures may fall to 5 °C over winter.
- Reference translation: Air temperatures will be around 30 °C in the summer, and temperatures may fall to 5 °C over winter.

The reference translation is identical to the machine translation, except for the comma issue mentioned in step 1. The reference translation also omits the comma after ""summer,"" which is consistent with the machine translation.

Conclusion:
The machine translation captures the main ideas of the source text but loses some nuance in the temperature drop description and omits a comma. The reference translation is mostly the same, with a minor punctuation difference. The overall quality of the machine translation is good but could be improved by retaining the nuance of the source text and maintaining consistent punctuation.

|Source: Jüriöö ülestõusu teemat on palju kasutatud ilukirjanduses ja muudes kunstiteostes.|
|Machine translation: The theme of the Jury's uprising has been much used in literature and other works of art.|
|Reference translation: The theme of the St. George's Night Uprising has been much used in literature and other works of art.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""Jüriöö ülestõusu,"" which refers to the St. George's Night Uprising in Estonian history. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Jury's uprising,"" which is not a specific event but a general term for a group uprising, losing the historical context.
2. The reference translation correctly specifies ""St. George's Night Uprising,"" providing the necessary historical context.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not capture the specific historical event (St. George's Night Uprising) mentioned in the source text, leading to a less accurate representation of the content. The reference translation is more faithful to the original meaning and context.

|Source: Tulistamises sai haavata kuus inimest, teiste seas Esindajatekoja liige Steve Scalise.|
|Machine translation: Six people were injured in the income, including Steve Scalise, Member of the House of Representatives.|
|Reference translation: Six people were injured in the shooting, including Steve Scalise, Member of the House of Representatives.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""tulistamises"" (shooting), which is the event where people were injured. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""income,"" which is a completely different context.
2. The reference translation correctly uses ""shooting"" to convey the event.
3. Both the machine and reference translations mention ""Steve Scalise"" and his position as ""Member of the House of Representatives,"" which is consistent.
4. The comma and the word ""teiste seas"" (including) are not translated in the machine translation, which affects the clarity of the sentence.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the event description (shooting vs. income) and the lack of proper context provided by the comma and additional phrase. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

|Reference| There is a preserved manuscript by Eckhart, on which he has written a few side notes in his own hand.| | |
|Translation| | He has kept his handletter, Mr Eckhart, which he has provided for a few peripheral remarks. | |
|Analysis|
1. **""On säilinud"" (is preserved)**: The machine translation uses ""He has kept"", which is a more general statement, while the reference translation specifies that the manuscript is ""preserved"".
2. **""tema Eckharti käsikiri"" (his Eckhart manuscript)**: The machine translation omits the possessive ""tema"" (his) and instead refers to it as ""Mr Eckhart's"", which is less precise.
3. **""mille ta varustas"" (which he equipped)**: The machine translation uses ""which he has provided"", which implies a supply or offering, whereas the reference translation more accurately conveys the idea that Eckhart ""wrote"" or ""equipped"" the manuscript with side notes.
4. **""omakäeliste ääremärkustega"" (with personal marginal notes)**: The machine translation translates this as ""for a few peripheral remarks"", which loses the specificity of ""personal"" and ""marginal"" notes.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its choice of words, loss of possessive and specificity, and a less accurate representation of the action of writing marginal notes. The reference translation provides a clearer and more faithful translation of the original Estonian text.

Source: Virunga alal elavad ka elevandid, lõvid, šimpansid, antiloobid ja tüügassead.
Reference translation: Elephants , lions , chimpanzees , antelopes and warthogs also live in the Virunga area.

1. **Translation of individual words and phrases:**
   - ""Virunga alal"" (in the Virunga area) is correctly translated in both the MT and RT.
   - ""elavad ka"" (also live) is present in both translations.
   - ""elevandid"" (elephants) is translated as ""paragraphs"" in MT, which is incorrect. The correct translation should be ""elephants"".
   - ""lõvid"" (lions) is correctly translated.
   - ""šimpansid"" (chimpanzees) is correctly translated.
   - ""antiloobid"" (antelopes) is translated as ""anti-foetuses"" in MT, which is incorrect. The correct translation should be ""antelopes"".
   - ""ja tüügassead"" (and typical species) is not present in the MT, but it's a less common way to express ""and other species"" or ""and various animals"" in English. The MT omits this part.

2. **Structure and meaning:**
   - The MT incorrectly combines ""paragraphs"" with the other animals, which is not a suitable translation for ""antiloobid"" (antelopes) or ""typical species"" (tüügassead).
   - The reference translation maintains a clear list of animals, while the MT incorrectly translates ""antiloobid"" and omits ""ja tüügassead"", resulting in a less coherent and less accurate meaning.

3. **Overall evaluation:**
   The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, with incorrect translations for ""antiloobid"" and the omission of ""ja tüügassead."" The structure and meaning are not preserved as well as in the reference.

The machine translation and the reference translation have a few differences:

1. **Omission of ""War of Independence""**: The source text mentions ""Vabadussõda"" which translates to ""War of Freedom"" in English. The machine translation omits this phrase, referring to it simply as ""the war on freedom."" The reference translation includes the full phrase, which is more accurate and contextually appropriate.

2. **Capitalization of ""War of Independence""**: In the reference translation, ""War of Independence"" is capitalized, which is common when referring to a specific historical event. The machine translation does not capitalize it, but it is not a major error since the capitalization is not always preserved in machine translations.

3. **Punctuation**: The source text does not have a comma after ""Aga"" (However), but the machine translation and reference translation both include it. This is a minor difference and does not significantly affect the meaning.

Overall, the machine translation captures the main idea but loses some context and specificity by not including ""War of Independence"" and capitalizing it. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original text.

|Reference translation: If the answer is that Hilda wanted to inherit Edgar 's money , then the background knowledge contains the usual assumptions of a murder investigatior about the motivation, means and opportunity.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""Hilda tahtis Edgari raha pärida,"" which translates to ""Hilda wanted to inherit Edgar's money"" in the reference translation. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""ask Edgari for money,"" which changes the context and meaning.
2. The reference translation uses ""inherit"" to convey the idea of receiving money after someone's death, while the machine translation uses ""ask for"" which implies a request for money in a different context.
3. The term ""mõrvauurija"" in the source text refers to a murderer, which is translated as ""murder investigatior"" in the reference translation. The machine translation uses ""murderer"" but with a slightly different phrasing, which is still accurate but less precise.
4. The reference translation uses ""background knowledge"" to describe the context, while the machine translation uses ""background"" which is less specific. However, the meaning is similar.

Overall, the machine translation has significant differences in the context and choice of words, particularly in the interpretation of Hilda's intention and the term used for the investigator. The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: Üldistatud heasoovlikkus on kindlasti olemas kõigil, kellega tasub eetikat arutada.
Machine translation: The generalised goodwill certainly exists in all those with whom it is worth discussing ethics.

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, which is that there is a general goodwill present in people who are worth discussing ethics with. The key phrases ""Üldistatud heasoovlikkus"" (generalised goodwill) and ""kellega tasub eetikat arutada"" (worth discussing ethics with) are accurately translated.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: The generalised goodwill certainly exists in all those with whom it is worth discussing ethics.
Reference translation: The generalised goodwill certainly exists in all those with whom it is worth discussing ethics.

The reference translation is identical to the machine translation, with no differences in wording or structure.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality and closely matches the reference translation.

|Reference translation: Then people will have to be taken separately from their social practices, and then we will not necessarily see them realistically.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""lahus"" which means ""away"" or ""apart"" in Estonian, but the machine translation uses ""taken away"", which is a more literal translation but does not convey the same separation as ""lahus"". The reference translation uses ""separately"", which is a better match for the original meaning.
2. The phrase ""nende ühiskonna praktikatest"" in the source text refers to ""social practices"" in Estonian, but the machine translation translates it as ""internships in their society"", which is not entirely accurate. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""their social practices"".
3. The machine translation adds the word ""away"" after ""taken"" which is not present in the source text, altering the meaning slightly. The reference translation omits this addition, maintaining the original structure.

Overall, the machine translation has differences in the choice of words and the structure, which affect the clarity and accuracy of the translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text in terms of meaning and nuance.

After reading the source, machine translation, and reference translation, I can analyze the differences:

1. **Source**: Vastutuse rünnaku eest võttis islamiliikumise Ţālebān Pakistani haru.
   - Machine translation: It was the Pakistani branch of the Islamic movement in Ţālebân who took responsibility for the attack.
   - Reference translation: It was the Pakistani branch of the Islamic movement in Ţālebân who took responsibility for the attack.

2. **Translation**: The machine translation and the reference translation are identical, except for the trailing period at the end of the sentence. The source text does not have a period, so the machine translation should not include one either.

3. **Punctuation**: The machine translation includes a period, which is not present in the source or the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it does not change the meaning of the sentence.

4. **Grammar and structure**: The grammar and sentence structure are the same in both the machine and reference translations, which indicates that the translation is accurate in terms of conveying the meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with the only difference being the inclusion of an unnecessary period at the end. The core information about the Pakistani branch of the Islamic movement in Ţālebân taking responsibility for the attack is correctly translated.

|Machine translation:| According to Warnock, the human situation would be worse without ethics.|
|Reference translation:| According to Warnock, the human condition would be worse without ethics.|

|Analysis:|
1. **Subject and verb agreement**: Both the machine and reference translations correctly use ""the human situation"" or ""the human condition"" to refer to the context, which is consistent.
2. **Source name**: The machine translation has ""Warnock"" without the possessive ""i"" (Warnocki), which is a minor difference. The reference translation uses the correct possessive form, ""Warnock's.""
3. **Lack of article**: The source includes the definite article ""eesti"" (literally ""Estonian"" but in this context it means ""without ethics"") before ""eetikata,"" which is not present in the machine translation. The reference translation omits this article, as it is not necessary in English.
4. **Adverbial phrase**: The source includes ""järgi"" (literally ""following"" or ""according to""), which is translated as ""According to"" in both the machine and reference translations, but the reference omits the comma after it, which is a stylistic choice.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate, with only a minor difference in the source name and a stylistic choice regarding the comma. The main content and meaning are preserved. The main difference is the lack of the possessive ""i"" in the source name, which is a minor error.

|Analysis:|
1. **""sündmuskohal stabiliseerida""** (stabilise on the ground) - Machine translation: ""stabilise the disease on the ground"" might be a misinterpretation, as it suggests stabilizing the disease physically, whereas the source text implies stabilizing patients in terms of their condition, not the disease itself.
2. **""rõhk on sõltumata seisundist""** (emphasis is regardless of the condition) - Machine translation: ""regardless of the condition at high speed of transport"" is not accurate. The source text does not mention the speed of transport as a factor but rather the condition of the patients.
3. **""kiirel transpordil""** (at high speed of transport) - Machine translation: This phrase is translated as ""at high speed of transport,"" which is not directly included in the reference translation.
