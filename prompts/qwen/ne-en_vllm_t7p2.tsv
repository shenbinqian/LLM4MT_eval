|Source: २६ र २७ गते दुर्इदिनसम्म सत्याग्रह चलेपछि राजकीय परिषदबाट मागहरू पूरा गरिदिने स्वीकृति प्राप्त भएकाले नेपाली कांग्रेसका अध्यक्ष वी.पी.|
|Machine translation: W. P., chairman of the Nepali Congress, who obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council after a satellite run of 26 and 27.|
|Reference translation: B. P. , the chairman of the Nepali Congress , who obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council after a Satyagrah run of 26 and 27.|

Analysis:
1. The source text uses ""सत्याग्रह"" (Satyagrah), which refers to a nonviolent protest or campaign, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""satellite run."" This is a significant difference, as it changes the meaning of the event being described.
2. The reference translation uses ""B. P."" (B. P.) for the chairman's name, while the machine translation omits the first name, only using ""W. P."" This inconsistency in the name could lead to confusion about the individual being referred to.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the event description (misinterpreting ""सत्याग्रह"" as a satellite run) and the clarity of the chairman's name. The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

Step 1: Compare the sentence structure
- Source: ""पछि गरिएका अनुसन्धानहरुबाट उनको जन्म दक्षिण भारतमा भएको जानकारी प्राप्त हुन्छ"" (After the research, the information about his birth in South India is obtained.)
- Machine translation: ""His birthday from later investigations is obtained in South India.""
- Reference translation: ""From later investigations, this information is obtained that he was born in South India.""

Step 2: Identify differences in word order and phrasing
- Source: The sentence structure is more complex, with ""पछि गरिएका अनुसन्धानहरुबाट"" (from later investigations) coming before ""उनको जन्म"" (his birth) and ""दक्षिण भारतमा भएको"" (born in South India) as a separate clause.
- Machine translation: Simplifies the structure, placing ""His birthday"" at the beginning and ""in South India"" after ""obtained.""
- Reference translation: Maintains a similar structure to the source, with ""From later investigations"" followed by ""this information is obtained"" and ""that he was born in South India.""

Step 3: Analyze the meaning preservation
- The machine translation loses the nuance of the source sentence, which specifies that the information about his birth in South India is a result of later investigations.
- The reference translation captures this meaning, emphasizing that the information is obtained from the investigations.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its sentence structure and emphasis on the source of the information. The reference translation more accurately reflects the original meaning by maintaining the complexity of the source sentence and emphasizing the connection to the investigations.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: सङ्घीयताको आधुनिक अवधारणा संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिकामा सन् १७७६ देखि १७८९ बीचमा भएको मानिन्छ।
Machine translation: The modern concept of federalism is considered to have been between 1776 and 1789 in the United States.

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The machine translation uses ""have been"" while the source text uses ""भएको"" (which means ""to have come"" or ""to have existed"" in Nepali). The source text implies a period of origin or establishment, not necessarily continuous existence.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: The modern concept of federalism is considered to have originated in the United States between 1776 and 1789.

Step 4: Analyze the difference.
- The reference translation uses ""originated,"" which is a more accurate term to convey the idea of the beginning or establishment of the concept, as in the source text.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the choice of verb. ""भएको"" in the source text implies a point of establishment, while ""have been"" in the machine translation suggests a continuous state. The reference translation, ""originated,"" better captures the intended meaning from the source text.

|Source: तर गैर व्यवसायिक करयोग्य सम्पत्ति राख्ने कार्य लगानी मानिने छ ।|
|Machine translation: But nonprofit taxable assets will be considered a working investment.|
|Reference translation: But keeping non-commercial taxable assets will be considered an investment.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text in Nepali discusses the act of ""राख्ने कार्य लगानी"" (keeping something), which refers to the act of maintaining or holding non-commercial assets.
2. The machine translation translates ""राख्ने कार्य"" as ""a working investment,"" which implies that the assets are actively involved in generating income or are part of a business operation. This is not accurate, as the source text does not specify that the assets are being used for productive work.
3. The reference translation, on the other hand, correctly translates ""राख्ने कार्य"" as ""keeping"" and refers to the assets as ""an investment,"" which is a more general term that does not imply active income generation.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""राख्ने कार्य"" as a ""working investment"" instead of simply ""keeping"" or ""an investment."" The reference translation better captures the meaning of the original Nepali text, which does not specify the assets' active involvement in generating income.|im_end|

|Machine translation: Milkwood Hillan costs surgically what moves Nori bombs after bringing a search for her.|
|Reference translation: Dudhkuwa started shaking, bulls started fighting, the king started to order, what is happening, when asked to search and bring Naari Bam Paikalo that he might be somewhere, they searched for Naari Bam and brought him.|

|Analysis|
1. **Mistakes in sentence structure**: The machine translation has a completely incorrect sentence structure, which is not present in the reference translation. The source sentence describes a series of actions (दुधकुवा, जुधन, सरग गड्कन) and a subsequent event (नरी बम पैकालो कही) followed by the search for Naari Bam.
2. **Misinterpretation of words**: ""दुधकुवा हिल्लन"" is translated as ""Milkwood Hillan costs surgically,"" which is a misinterpretation. ""दुधकुवा"" means ""started shaking"" (implying an earthquake), not ""costing surgically.""
3. **Incorrect translation of ""नरी बम पैकालो कही""**: The machine translation translates this as ""what moves Nori bombs,"" which is not accurate. It should be translated as ""when asked to search for Naari Bam.""
4. **Missing context**: The machine translation lacks the context of the king's order and the action of searching for Naari Bam.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of sentence structure, word interpretation, and context. The reference translation captures the meaning and sequence of events more accurately.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: त्यहाँबाट र्फकने वित्तिकै उनले ""मिनिष्टर"" पदवी लिए ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: From there onwards, he took the post ""Minister"".

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Upon his return, he took the post of "" Minister "" .

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""वित्तिकै"" (financially) from the source text, which is important for context as it suggests the position was taken in a financial context.
- The machine translation uses ""From there onwards"" instead of ""त्यहाँबाट र्फकने"" (upon his return), which changes the timing of the event.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality
The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it loses crucial context and changes the timing of the event. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuances of the source text.

|Reference translation: According to Mr. George Grierson, the Murmis consider themselves one of the oldest inhabitants of Tibet.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""जर्ज ग्रियर्सन महोदयका"" (Mr. George Grierson), but the machine translation incorrectly combines it into ""George Grierson Mahoney"" by adding a space and possibly assuming it's a single name.
2. The honorific ""महोदयका"" (Mr.) is missing in the machine translation, which is a crucial part of addressing someone respectfully in Nepali.
3. The word ""हरु"" (they) is implied in the source but not explicitly mentioned in the machine translation, which might lead to a less clear understanding of the subject.
4. The reference translation correctly uses ""the Murmis"" (मुर्मीहरु) while the machine translation omits the plural form, which is important to convey the group being referred to.

|Reference translation: In addition to this , people of this race raise livestock as well as make materials from bamboo like Doko , Namlo , Thunchey , Daalo , Mandro , Chitraa , Nanglo , Bhakari etc .|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""जातिका मानिसहरू"" (people of this race), which is translated to ""the people of this land"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly uses ""people of this race,"" which is more specific and contextually accurate.
2. The machine translation omits the word ""पशुपालन"" (livestock raising), which is crucial to understanding the context of the sentence. The reference translation includes this term, making it clear that the people are engaged in raising animals.
3. The machine translation uses ""contents of animals and docs"" instead of specifying the materials made from bamboo. The reference translation specifies these materials as ""like Doko, Namlo, Thunchey, Daalo, Mandro, Chitraa, Nanglo, Bhakari,"" which is a more accurate translation.

In summary, the machine translation is missing important context and specific details, while the reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately. The differences lie in the reference's emphasis on the race, livestock raising, and the specific bamboo materials.

|Source: धार्मिक दृष्टिले यी चार महिना भगवान विष्णुको निद्रा काल मानिन्छ।|
|Machine translation: The religious scene consists of a sleeping couple of these four months goddesses.|
|Reference translation: From a religious perspective, these four months are considered to be the sleeping period of god Vishnu.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference in structure**: The machine translation changes the structure of the sentence, altering the meaning. The source sentence refers to ""the sleeping period of god Vishnu"" (भगवान विष्णुको निद्रा काल) as a whole, while the machine translation incorrectly splits it into ""a sleeping couple of these four months goddesses.""

2. **Loss of context**: The machine translation loses the context of the deity being Vishnu, which is crucial in understanding the religious significance.

3. **Translation of ""मानिन्छ""**: The machine translation does not translate this verb correctly. ""मानिन्छ"" means ""are considered"" or ""are considered to be"" in Nepali, which implies a belief or tradition. The machine translation does not convey this aspect.

4. **Translation of ""दृष्टिले""**: The machine translation omits this word, which means ""from a religious perspective"" or ""religiously."" This phrase is important for understanding the context of the statement.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of structure, context, and the accurate conveyance of the original meaning. The reference translation maintains the religious perspective and the specific reference to god Vishnu, while the machine translation fails to do so.

|Machine translation: During the teenage years, the mind of the apocalypse reveals the power of the apocalypse by revealing the power of the apocalypse.|
|Reference translation: During Dashain, people perform various practices to reveal their such inner power with the intention to fulfill their desires.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Context**: The source text refers to ""दसैंका बेलामा"" (Dashain), a significant Nepali festival, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""the teenage years,"" which is a general term and not specific to a festival.

2. **Action**: The source mentions ""साधना गर्छन"" (performing practices), which is a more accurate translation of the Nepali verb ""गर्छन"" (people do). The machine translation, however, omits this context and instead talks about ""revealing the power of the apocalypse.""

3. **Intent**: The source states that the actions are performed ""मनसायले प्रेरित"" (with the intention), which implies the desire to fulfill something. The machine translation does not capture this intention, simply stating that the mind reveals power.

4. **Translation of ""inner power"":** The reference translation uses ""such inner power"" to describe the Nepali phrase ""निहित ती शक्तिलाई"" (the inner power). The machine translation does not provide a similar nuance.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of context, specific cultural reference, and the intention behind the actions described. The machine translation loses the essence of the original Nepali text, while the reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation.

2. **महर्षि गौतमका सन्ततीहरू** (descendants of Maharshi Gautam) - Machine translation: ""the descendants of the honeymoon"" (incorrectly translates the reference to a spiritual figure)
3. **अर्थात** (i.e.) - Machine translation: ""or"" (implies a choice, but the context is a clarification)

|Reference translation: But he has explained experiences as extremly enjoyable "" and "" inferiority complex , poverty , pain and sometimes remain hungry in compulsion and forced to endure worldly injustice , etc "" .|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation differs in the interpretation of the words ""तर अत्यन्तै रमाइलो"" (तर = but, अत्यन्तै = exceptionally, रमाइलो = enjoyable). The machine translates it as ""exceptionally funny"", while the reference translation captures the meaning as ""extremely enjoyable"".
2. The phrase ""हिनताबोध"" (hinnabod = inferiority complex) is not accurately translated by the machine. It is missing the context and is translated as ""Hinnabod"", which is likely a mistranslation or a word not found in the English translation.
3. The machine translation omits the word ""गरीवी"" (gariwī = poor) and combines it with ""Hinnabod"" in a way that does not make sense in the English sentence.
4. The phrase ""कहिलेकाहीं भोकै बस्न बाध्य"" (kahilekāhin bokai basn bādhya = sometimes hungry, to be forced) is translated as ""sometimes hungry, to be forced to sit down"", which is not an accurate representation of the original meaning. The reference translation correctly captures the idea of being forced to remain hungry.
5. The machine translation has ""to endure the undertaking of a career"" instead of ""सन्सारको अन्याय सहनु"" (sanskarko anyāy sahnu = to endure worldly injustice). The latter is a more appropriate and contextually accurate translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation has significant differences in the interpretation of the source text, particularly in the understanding of the emotions and experiences described, and the context of the words. The reference translation provides a more accurate and meaningful representation of the original Nepali text.

|Reference translation: He had eight types of yogik power anima, mahima, garima, lagima, prapti, prakmya, ishityo, and basityo.|

|Analysis|
1. **""आठ प्रकारका""** (Eight types) - Machine translation: ""genealogical powers"" (which is not accurate, as it refers to a different context than the reference's ""yogik power"")
2. **""यौगिक शक्तिहरू""** (yogik powers) - Machine translation: ""genealogical powers"" (misinterpretation of the term)
3. **""अणिमा, महिमा, गरिमा, लघिमा""** (anima, mahima, garima, lagima) - Machine translation: ""molecular, glory, poverty, lagging"" (incorrect translations of the Nepali terms)
4. **""प्राप्ति, प्रकाम्य, इशित्व, वशित्व""** (prapti, prakmya, ishityo, basityo) - Machine translation: ""receiving, publishing, hinting, and virtue"" (again, incorrect translations)
5. **""उनमा थिए।""** (They were in her) - Machine translation: ""of her"" (implies possession, whereas the reference simply states the powers possessed by someone)

In summary, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the correct interpretation of the Nepali terms, the context of ""yogik power"" versus ""genealogical powers,"" and the structure of the sentence. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning and terms from the source text, while the machine translation introduces errors and misinterpretations.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: कर्मचारी भएमा कार्यालयबाट नै र रा.प.अनंर्.कर्मचारी भएमा विभागबाट निर्दिष्ट

Step 2: Understand the meaning
The source text seems to be discussing the employment status of a person, distinguishing between being employed from an office (for gazetted employees) and from a department (for non-gazetted employees).

Step 3: Compare the machine translation
Machine translation: Specifically from the department if employed, and from the office if employed.

Step 4: Identify differences
The machine translation is not accurate in capturing the distinction between gazetted and non-gazetted employees. It suggests that the employment is determined by the department or office without specifying the different categories.

Step 5: Compare with the reference translation
Reference translation: From office if employee and from department if non-gazetted employee

Step 6: Analyze the discrepancies
The reference translation correctly differentiates between the two scenarios: employment from the office for employees (implied to be gazetted) and employment from the department for non-gazetted employees.

Conclusion: The machine translation is lacking the key distinction between gazetted and non-gazetted employees, which is present in the reference translation. The machine translation could be improved by including this distinction to better reflect the source text's meaning.

Source: जसमध्ये  सन् २००६ मा आयोबले नेल्सन मण्डेला कोष छाडे ।
Machine translation: In 2006 of which iob left the Nelson Mandela fund.

Step 2: Identify differences in word order and structure.
- The source text uses ""जसमध्ये"" (in which) to introduce the context, while the machine translation omits this.
- The source text uses ""सन् २००६ मा"" (in the year 2006) to specify the time, but the machine translation separates ""2006"" from the rest of the sentence.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: In 2006, Ayob left the Nelson Mandela Fund.

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""आयोबले"" (Ayob) as ""iob"" and omits the name, which is a significant error.
- The reference translation uses ""left"" (छाडे) while the machine translation does not provide a verb for the action.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the name ""Ayob"" being mistranslated as ""iob"" and the lack of a verb to convey the action of leaving. Additionally, the structure and context provided by the source text are not accurately captured in the machine translation.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: यसमा सङ्घीय संरचना हुन्छ तर केन्द्रले इकाइहरूलाई केही अधिकार दिएको हुन्छ र केन्द्रको आदेशमा इकाइहरू चल्छन्।
- Machine translation: It has a federal structure but the center has some authority to the units and the units run on the command of the center.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- The machine translation uses ""run on the command of"" while the source text uses ""चल्छन्"" which is a verb that implies ""function"" or ""operate"" in the context of the sentence.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: It has a federal structure but the center has given some authority to the units and the units run under the command of the center.

Step 4: Analyze the difference.
- The reference translation uses ""under the command of"" which is a more precise and idiomatic way to convey the idea of the units being controlled or directed by the center, as opposed to ""on the command of"" which might imply a more active or immediate response.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the choice of phrase ""on the command of"" versus ""under the command of."" The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the idea of the units functioning or operating in response to the center's authority, using a phrase that is more commonly used in English to express hierarchical control.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it misinterprets the Zonal Transportation Office and its context, translating it as irrigation level functions instead of a transportation office. Additionally, it omits the reference to the unit-level offices, which are present in the source text. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the original Nepali text.

Step 1: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- मंगलमूरत (Mangalamurta)
- रूपमा (in the form of)
- अथवा (or)
- शङ्कट मोचकको रूपमा (in the form of Shankat Mochak)
- पुजन (worship)
- थालियो (started)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""It was initially referred to as 'Mangalmurat' or as sankt moch.""
- Reference translation: ""Worship as 'Mangalamurta' or Shankat Mochakwas started.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation uses ""referred to as"" instead of ""started"" for the worship, which changes the meaning slightly. The reference translation indicates that the worship began in these forms, while the machine suggests that it was initially given these names.
- The machine translation omits the word ""रूपमा"" (in the form of) from the second part, which is important to convey the context of how worship was performed.
- The machine translation has ""sankt moch"" instead of ""शङ्कट मोचक"" (Shankat Mochak), which is a proper noun and might be mistranslated.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of verb choice (referred to vs. started), the inclusion of ""रूपमा,"" and the accuracy of the proper noun ""शङ्कट मोचक."" The machine translation could be improved by using ""started"" for the worship and maintaining the correct form and name in the second part.

|Source: ऋषि तर्पणी पूर्णिमाको अघिल्लो राति ठूलो मेला लाग्ने उक्त पोखरीको व्यापक प्रचार प्रसार हुन सकेको खण्डमा पर्यटकीय आकर्षण बढ्न सक्ने|
|Machine translation: There is a debate over whether a segment of the pool could increase tourist attractions on the previous night of the borrowing perfection.|
|Reference translation: It is undeniable that the tourist attraction could increase if the pond, where a big fair is conducted on the previous night of Rishi Tarpani Purnima, is widely promoted.|

|Analysis|
1. **""ऋषि तर्पणी पूर्णिमाको अघिल्लो राति""** (previous night of Rishi Tarpani Purnima) - Machine translation: ""previous night of the borrowing perfection"" - The source refers to a specific religious event, Rishi Tarpani Purnima, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""borrowing perfection.""
2. **""ठूलो मेला लाग्ने उक्त पोखरीको""** (where a big fair is conducted) - Machine translation: ""a segment of the pool"" - The source describes a fair held in a pond, not a pool. The machine translation incorrectly identifies the location.
3. **""व्यापक प्रचार प्रसार""** (widespread promotion) - Machine translation: ""debate over whether"" - The source implies that widespread promotion would lead to increased tourist attraction, while the machine translation suggests uncertainty about the effect.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific event (Rishi Tarpani Purnima), the location (pond vs. pool), and the certainty of the relationship between promotion and increased tourist attraction. The reference translation captures the intended meaning more accurately.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Office on policy and circumstances not to integrate or divide the base

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Office in relation to unification or division on the basis of policy and circulars etc.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""नगर्ने सम्वन्धमा"" (in relation to the city/negotiations) from the source text, which is crucial for understanding the context.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""नीति तथा परिपत्र समेतका"" (including policy and circulars) as ""policy and circumstances not to"", which reverses the meaning and does not convey the intended relationship between policy and circulars.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of context and the correct interpretation of the source text.

|Reference translation: The cities in the southern and western parts of Sikkim connect Sikkim with the hilly cities Kalimpong and Darjeeling of the northern part of West Bengal.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject and verb**: The source text refers to ""सिक्किमको दक्षिणी र पश्चिमी भागका सहरहरू"" (cities in the southern and western parts of Sikkim) as the subject, while the machine translation incorrectly uses ""the Southern and western parts of sikkim"" as if it's a singular entity. The reference translation correctly identifies the subject as ""cities"".
2. **Connectivity**: The source text uses ""जोडदछ"" (connect), which is a verb indicating a joining action. The machine translation omits this verb, making the connection between Sikkim and the mountain cities less clear. The reference translation includes ""connect"" to convey the same meaning.
3. **Description of cities**: The source text specifies ""पर्वतीय सहर"" (hill cities), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation adds ""hilly"" to provide a clearer description of Kalimpong and Darjeeling.
4. **Precision of place names**: The source text uses ""कालिम्पोङ"" and ""दार्जीलिङ"" (Kalimpong and Darjeeling) without any additional description. The machine translation and reference translation both retain these names, but the reference translation adds ""of the northern part of West Bengal"" for context.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of subject identification, verb clarity, and the description of the cities. The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually rich translation.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: फ्रान्समा धेरै पहिलेदेखि निरंकुस शासन चलेको थियो ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: In France, very early nineteenth century rule was run.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: France had a long history of autocracy rule.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""फ्रान्समा धेरै पहिलेदेखि"" (very early in France), which refers to the early 19th century.
- The machine translation translates this as ""very early nineteenth century rule was run,"" which is a direct translation but loses the context of ""nirंकुस शासन"" (autocratic rule).

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The reference translation states ""a long history of autocracy rule,"" which implies a historical context rather than specifying a time period as the machine translation does.

Step 6: Identify the differences
- The machine translation focuses on the time period (very early 19th century) but does not convey the concept of autocracy as explicitly as the reference translation.
- The reference translation emphasizes the historical aspect and the nature of the rule, which is not as clear in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in that it does not capture the full meaning of the source text, specifically the emphasis on autocratic rule and the historical context rather than just the time period. The reference translation provides a more nuanced understanding of the source's message.

Machine translation: It is declared a submarine, including the gavi.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: It has been declared a sub-metropolis by including the VDC.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the source text
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""गाविसलाई समावेश गरेर"" (including the VDCs) as ""including the gavi,"" which is a misinterpretation of the context. The source text is referring to VDCs (Village Development Committees) in the Nepali context, not a submarine.

- The machine translation also translates ""उपमहानगरपालिका घोषणा"" (declaration of a sub-metropolitan area) as ""submarine,"" which is a completely unrelated term.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation does not capture the correct meaning of the source text, as it fails to convey the concept of a sub-metropolitan area being declared by including VDCs.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of poor quality because it significantly misunderstands the context and meaning of the source text, resulting in a translation that is unrelated to the original content.

- Reference translation: People of this community do not walk around wearing Trishul and Kamandalu in the guise of a saint when asking donation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""समदायका व्यक्तिहरू"" (people of this community) as ""this plaintiff,"" which is a misinterpretation of the context.
- The machine translation mentions ""a violation"" which is not present in the source text. The source is about the act of asking for donation, not a violation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation has a few issues:
  a. ""बारम्बार अनुरोध"" (repeated requests) is translated as ""all requested the bargain,"" which is not accurate. It should be translated as ""repeated requests from everyone.""
  b. ""दैव इच्छा"" (divine wish) is translated as ""the door wishes,"" which is a literal and incorrect interpretation. It should be translated as ""thinking it was a divine wish.""
  c. ""तर्फ प्रस्थान गरे"" (left for Nepal) is correct, but the structure is slightly awkward in the machine translation.

Step 4: Conclusion.
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of accurately conveying the meaning of the source text.

|Reference translation: After the construction by Jan Gaarstindhaara in 1786 A.D., Golghar became the symbol of Patna city.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""जन गार्स्टिनद्धारा"" (Jan Gaarstindhaara), which is a proper noun referring to a person. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Esqui,"" which is likely a typographical error or a misunderstanding of the name.

**Analysis:**

1. **Translation of ""नक्षत्रका अधिदेवता"" (constellation deity):**
   - Machine translation: ""this non-major planet""
   - Reference translation: ""the overwhelming deity""
   The machine translation incorrectly translates the deity as a non-major planet, while the reference correctly identifies it as the overwhelming deity of the constellation.

2. **Translation of ""अर्यमा"" (Arya):**
   - Machine translation: ""Arabia""
   - Reference translation: ""Arya""
   The machine translation incorrectly translates ""अर्यमा"" as ""Arabia,"" which is a geographical term, while the reference keeps it as the deity's name.

3. **Translation of ""मुख्य ग्रह"" (main planet):**
   - Both translations: ""the main planet""
   This part is correctly translated by both the machine and reference translations.

4. **Translation of ""सूर्य"" (sun):**
   - Both translations: ""the sun""
   This part is also correctly translated.

**Overall evaluation:**
The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of the deity's identification and the incorrect interpretation of ""अर्यमा"" as ""Arabia.""

|Analysis|
1. **Source**: The source text mentions ""झilxhile dhunga"" (झilxhile stone), which refers to a specific type of stone in the local language.
2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""झilxhile dhunga"" as ""kainetic stone called stone,"" which loses the specific local name and implies a generic stone.

1. **Source text interpretation**: The source text in Nepali discusses the management of responsibilities, specifically mentioning the storage or handling of information related to someone's job or position.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation attempts to convey the idea of keeping data related to responsibility and mentions an auction, which is not mentioned in the source text. It also incorrectly translates ""वढुवा"" (vadhuvaa, meaning older) as ""older"" and ""अकरणमा"" (akaranama, meaning in the absence) as ""when a prize is started.""

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text, using ""usually"" to indicate the general context, and specifying that the records are maintained when someone is transferred, promoted, or retired.

4. **Accuracy and context**: The machine translation loses the context of the Nepali text, which is about the management of records in a work-related context, and introduces elements (auction and prize) that are not present in the source.

5. **Grammar and structure**: The machine translation has incorrect grammar and sentence structure, particularly in the English part.

Step 1: Understand the source text
The source text in Nepali says, ""प्रायः शोधार्थीले शोध क्रममा र शोध समापन पछि लेखेका हुन्छन्"" which translates to ""Usually, researchers write during and after the research.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation provided is ""Often, sorcery is written after the sorcery order and after the sorcery completion."" This translation seems to be about a different context, as it refers to ""sorcery"" instead of ""research"" and the sequence of events is not accurately conveyed.

Step 3: Analyze the differences
- The source text specifically mentions ""शोधार्थी"" (researchers), while the machine translation uses ""sorcery"" which is a misinterpretation.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""शोध क्रममा"" (during the research) as ""after the sorcery order,"" which is not a suitable equivalent.
- ""शोध समापन पछि"" (after the research completion) is translated as ""after the sorcery completion,"" which again is not accurate.

|Source: अहिले यसलाई देउडा गीत, देउडा संस्कृती, देउडा भाषा, देउडा खेल आदि नामले  चिनिन्छ ।|
|Machine translation: Nowadays it is known by the name deoda song, deoda culture, deoda language, deoda games, etc.|
|Reference translation: Now it is known as the name Deuda song , Deuda culture , Deuda language , Deuda game , etc .|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses the term ""देउडा"" (Deuda) with a lowercase ""d"", while the reference translation capitalizes it as ""Deuda"". This is a minor difference in formatting, not affecting the meaning.
2. The machine translation uses ""known by the name"" which is a slightly different phrasing than the reference's ""known as."" However, both convey the same idea that these things are referred to by the name Deuda.
3. The punctuation in the machine translation is correct, but the reference translation omits the comma after ""Deuda game,"" which is a stylistic choice and does not affect the meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, with minor differences in capitalization and punctuation style. The core meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is more idiomatic and consistent with the Nepali language structure.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

|Source: अर्का राजनीतिक नेता उड्डयन मन्त्री तारिणीदत्त चटौतमाथि भ्रष्टाचारको अभियोग लाग्यो।|
|Machine translation: Another political leader was convicted of corruption on the UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE.|
|Reference translation: Another political leader, Aviation Minister Tarini Dutta Chataut, was accused of corruption.|

|Analysis:|
1. The source text mentions ""अर्का राजनीतिक नेता"" (Another political leader), which is correctly translated as ""Another political leader"" in the reference translation.
2. The name ""तारिणीदत्त चटौतमाथि"" (Tarini Dutta Chataut) is a proper noun, which is not translated as a single entity in the machine translation. Instead, it is split into ""Aviation Minister Tarini Dutta Chataut,"" which is a more accurate representation of the original name.
3. The machine translation incorrectly states that the leader was ""convicted of corruption"" on the UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE, while the source only mentions that an ""अभियोग"" (accusation) was made, not a conviction. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""was accused of corruption.""

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the leader's status (accused vs. convicted) and the preservation of the proper noun. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Nepali text.

|Source: स्टेफिनीले पछि जोरिकोसँग गठबन्धन गरेकी थिइन तर रेसलकेनियाको अर्को रात उनलाई ट्रिपल एचले पिन गरेका थिए जसका कारण स्टेफिनी बाध्य बनेकी थिइन।|
|Machine translation: Stephini did not go with yoriko later but racelockenia's next night he was pinned by triple h for which stephini was not forced to retire.|
|Reference translation: Stephanie then formed an alliance with Jericho, but Tripple H had pinned him in the other night of Wresstlemania because of which Stephanie was compelled.|

|Analysis|
1. **Alliance formation**: The source mentions ""गठबन्धन गरेकी"" (formed an alliance), which is translated as ""formed an alliance"" in both the machine and reference translations. However, the machine translation incorrectly uses ""yoriko"" instead of ""जोरिकोसँग"" (Jericho).
2. **Event night**: The source specifies ""रेसलकेनियाको अर्को रात"" (the next night of Wrestlemania), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it says ""racelockenia's next night,"" which is not accurate.
3. **Pinning**: Both translations correctly convey that ""ट्रिपल एचले"" (Triple H) pinned someone, but the machine translation incorrectly attributes this to ""racelockenia"" instead of ""जोरिकोसँग"" (Jericho).
4. **Compulsion**: The source states ""बाध्य बनेकी थिइन"" (was compelled), which is translated as ""was forced to retire"" in the reference translation. The machine translation omits the compulsion aspect, saying ""was not forced to retire,"" which is incorrect.

In summary, the machine translation has errors in identifying Jericho as the one who pinned Stephanie, using an incorrect name, and not conveying the compulsion aspect of the situation. The reference translation is more accurate in these aspects.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: मैले आफूले गरेका पुण्यद्वारा त्यस नगरलाई स्थिर बनाई दिन्छु।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: And I will make the city steadfast by the way which I have done.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: I will make the city stable from the virtue which I have done.

Step 4: Compare the differences
1. In the source text, ""मैले आफूले गरेका"" (māle afula garēka) means ""by the virtue I have done"" or ""with the goodness I have performed."" The machine translation translates this as ""by the way which I have done,"" which is not an accurate representation of the source's meaning, as ""way"" does not convey the concept of virtue.
2. The word ""स्थिर"" (sthir) in the source text means ""stable"" or ""firm,"" but the machine translation uses ""steadfast,"" which is a similar but not identical term. The reference translation uses ""stable,"" which is a more accurate equivalent.
3. The structure of the sentence is slightly different in the machine translation, which omits the word ""नगरलाई"" (nagarlai) and places ""by the way"" before ""I have done,"" whereas the reference translation keeps the original structure.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the concept of ""virtue"" vs. ""way,"" and the structure of the sentence. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuance of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: कटु, नराम्रा र वेदनादायी कुराहरूलाई समेत कत्ति पनि तलमाथि नपारी र तिनको आदर्शीकरण

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Don't hold down anything, including cuts, evils and altruism, and her idealism.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Hurtful, bad, and malified matters too without altering them and idolizing their

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation omits the word ""कत्ति पनि"" (which means ""too"" or ""also"" in this context) and the word ""तलमाथि"" (which seems to be a typo or a word that's not easily translated, possibly referring to a specific situation or context). It also translates ""नराम्रा"" (bad) as ""evils"" and ""वेदनादायी"" (malified) as ""altruism,"" which are incorrect translations.
- The reference translation captures the meaning of the source text more accurately, translating ""कटु"" (hurtful), ""नराम्रा"" (bad), and ""वेदनादायी"" (malified) as negative qualities, and ""तलमाथि"" as a way of not altering or changing them.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, missing important nuances and word choices, and providing incorrect translations for certain phrases. The reference translation better captures the meaning and tone of the source text.

|Reference translation: The impact of the Indian War of Independence, the armed peasantry in Telangana, and the Chinese People's War fully touched Kami Budha.|

|Analysis|
1. **""भारतीय स्वतन्त्रता सँग्राम""** (Indian Independence Movement) - Machine translation: ""With Indian Independence"" is a partial translation, missing the context of the movement. Reference: ""Indian War of Independence.""
2. **""तेलंगनामा चलेको सशस्त्र किसान""** (armed peasants in Telangana) - Machine translation: ""the surrounding farming"" is a misinterpretation, while the reference correctly translates it as ""armed peasantry in Telangana.""
3. **""चिनियाँ जनयुद्ध""** (Chinese People's War) - Machine translation: ""the influence of Chinese Juniors"" is a mistranslation, it should be translated as ""Chinese People's War.""
4. **""कामी वुढालाई""** (the impact on workers) - Machine translation: ""touched kami wulde well"" is not a clear or accurate translation. Reference: ""fully touched.""
5. **""राम्ररी छोयो""** (well received) - Machine translation: ""well"" is not the best choice here, the reference uses ""fully touched"" to convey the positive reception.

In summary, the machine translation has several inaccuracies and lacks context, while the reference translation captures the meaning more accurately. The differences lie in the translation of the independence movement, the armed peasantry, the Chinese war, and the expression of the impact. The machine translation could be improved by providing a more precise and culturally appropriate translation.

|im_start|>

Step 1: Identify the main subject and action in the source text.
Source: नेवार समुदायमा विशेष किसिमको एउटा खाद्यवस्तुको नामबाट यस पर्वको नामकरण गरिएको छ ।
Main subject: नेवार समुदायमा विशेष किसिमको एउटा खाद्यवस्तु (a special kind of food in the Nepali community)
Action: नामकरण गरिएको (naming the festival)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: This festival is named by the name of one of the foodstuffs of special kind in the nearby community.
Reference translation: Once there, they spend the next night there and go to Muna to the east from sunrise.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation focuses on the food item as the reason for naming the festival, while the reference translation does not mention a festival at all. Instead, it describes a sequence of events.
- The source text talks about a specific event (naming a festival), whereas the machine translation generalizes it to any festival without specifying the context.
- The reference translation does not translate the Nepali phrase ""नेवार समुदायमा"" (in the Nepali community) and omits the action of naming (नामकरण) entirely.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of the subject matter and context. It incorrectly translates the source text as a general statement about a festival being named after a food, whereas the reference translation describes a different event entirely. The Nepali-specific context and the action of naming are lost in the machine translation.

|comparison|
1. **Subject**: In the source, the subject is ""निर्वाचन आयोग"" (Election Commission), but the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""Deputy Commissioner.""
2. **Action**: The source mentions ""नेपालको संविधान बमोजिम हुने"" (concerning the amendment of Nepal's constitution), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it refers to the ""journal of archives and local authorities.""
3. **Events**: The source refers to ""जनमत सङ्ग्रह"" (public consultation) and ""स्थानीय निकायको निर्वाचन"" (local body elections), while the machine translation combines these into a single phrase ""journal of archives and local authorities.""
4. **Action verbs**: The machine translation omits the verb ""रेखदेख"" (supervises), which is present in the reference translation.

In summary, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of subject, context, and specific actions. The correct translation should focus on the role of the Election Commission in conducting, supervising, and controlling the constitutional referendum and local body elections, not the Deputy Commissioner or the journal of archives.

|Source: विष्णुसहस्रनाम विष्णुका १००० नामहरूको महिमा शान्तिपर्व मा।|
|Machine translation: In the glory peace of 1000 names of summerhusbandry summer.|
|Reference translation: Vishnu Sahasranama, the glory of 1000 names of Vishnu in Shanti Parva.|

Analysis:
1. **Word-by-word comparison:**
   - ""विष्णुसहस्रनाम"" (Vishnu Sahasranama) is not translated correctly. The machine translation incorrectly assumes ""summerhusbandry"" (which is a term related to agriculture, not Vishnu) instead of the proper term ""Vishnu Sahasranama,"" which refers to a sacred Hindu hymn with 1000 names of Vishnu.
   - ""विष्णुका"" (Vishnu's) is missing in the machine translation, which is crucial for identifying the subject.
   - ""१००० नामहरूको"" (1000 names') is translated as ""1000 names of"" but omits the possessive aspect, which is important for context.
   - ""महिमा"" (glory) is translated as ""glory"" but without the context, it loses the emphasis on the greatness.
   - ""शान्तिपर्व"" (Shanti Parva) is translated as ""peace of summer"" instead of the correct reference to a specific chapter in the Hindu epic, Mahabharata.

2. **Grammar and structure:**
   - The machine translation has a different structure, which results in a confusing and inaccurate meaning. The reference translation clearly states that it is about the ""glory of 1000 names of Vishnu"" in the ""Shanti Parva.""

3. **Contextual understanding:**
   - The machine translation fails to understand the cultural and religious context, which is essential for a proper Nepali-English translation of this text.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, context, and cultural understanding. It would be more appropriate to translate the source as: ""Vishnu Sahasranama, the glory of Vishnu's 1000 names in the Shanti Parva.""

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Mrada is one of the male sri rama patri saiva manners.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The dignified man Shree Ram is one of the obeying father 's order.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""मर्यादा पुरुष"" (Mrada man), which refers to a man with dignity or respect.
- ""श्रीराम पितृ"" (Shree Ram father) indicates that Shree Ram is the subject and the father is being referred to.
- ""बचन मान्नेहरूमा"" (obeying manners) implies that Shree Ram follows his father's instructions.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""मर्यादा पुरुष"" as ""Mrada is one of the male sri rama patri saiva manners,"" which loses the context of respect and instead suggests a connection to a specific religious tradition (Sri Rama Patri).
- It also translates ""बचन मान्नेहरूमा"" as ""mann manners,"" which is not accurate, as it implies a general concept of manners rather than obedience to a father's order.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of conveying the meaning of respect and obedience to the father's order. The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately.

|Reference translation: The culture of the Tibetans is preserved in this Dolpa region behind the Dhaulagiri Himal.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Location reference**: The source text specifies ""धौलागिरी हिमालको पछाडी"" (behind Dhaulagiri Himal), while the machine translation omits this specific reference, using ""behind the wealthy hill"" instead. This is a significant difference, as it loses the geographical context.

2. **Dolpa region**: The source and reference translations both refer to ""डोल्पा क्षेत्रमा"" (Dolpa region), but the machine translation does not include the word ""क्षेत्रमा"" (region), making it less clear.

3. **Proper noun**: The reference translation correctly includes ""Dhaulagiri Himal"" as a proper noun, while the machine translation does not, which could lead to confusion about the specific location.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of geographical specificity, the use of ""region"" and the inclusion of the proper noun ""Dhaulagiri Himal."" The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

- Machine translation: Several weapons and carriages were collected but the Darwin County Knight Thirvam Malla received shahadat.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
- Reference translation: Hundreds of weapons and millions of rupees were collected but unfortunately the revolutionary warrior Thiravam Malla was martyred.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- Machine translation:
  - ""सयौं"" (several) vs ""हजारों"" (hundreds) - The machine translation uses ""several"" which is not an accurate translation for the Nepali term ""सयौं"" which refers to a large but not exact number, whereas ""हजारों"" (hundreds) is a more precise translation.
  - ""लाखौ"" (lakhs) vs ""मिलियन"" (millions) - The machine translation omits the word ""रूपयाँ"" (rupees) and translates ""लाखौ"" as ""carriages,"" which is incorrect. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""millions of rupees.""
  - ""दर्ुभाग्यवस"" (unfortunately) is not present in the machine translation, which affects the overall tone and meaning of the sentence.

Step 5: Conclusion
- The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of quantity (specifically, ""several"" vs ""hundreds"" and ""lakhs"" vs ""millions""), the translation of ""लाखौ रूपयाँ"" (lakhs of rupees), and the absence of the crucial phrase ""दर्ुभाग्यवस"" (unfortunately) which conveys the unfortunate event of Thiravam Malla's martyrdom.

- Machine translation: Initially the object must be direction, salute or blessing.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
- Reference translation: In the beginning, there should be direction, greeting or blessing.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Differences:
   1. The machine translation uses ""must be"" (which implies a requirement or necessity), while the reference translation uses ""there should be"" (which suggests a recommendation or common practice).
   2. The word order in the machine translation is slightly different: ""Initially the object"" vs ""In the beginning"". Although the meaning is similar, the reference translation places ""in the beginning"" at the start for better clarity.
   3. The reference translation uses ""greeting"" instead of ""salute"" to maintain a more natural and inclusive context, as ""नमस्क्रिया"" in Nepali can refer to both salutations and greetings.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of tone, word choice, and sentence structure.

- Machine translation: From his steps in Qatar, the latest gothic region, brahmins etc., was enough to develop socialism.

Difference: The machine translation incorrectly identifies ""कत्युरमा"" (Katyur) as ""Qatar"" and refers to it as a ""gothic region,"" which is not accurate. The source text mentions the opportunity for social development in Katyur, not Qatar.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: From his steps in Qatar, the latest gothic region, brahmins etc., was enough to develop socialism.
- Reference translation: This step of him provided ample opportunity for social development of Gautam Gotri Chhetriyas , Brahmins , etc. in Katyur .

Difference: The reference translation correctly translates ""कत्युरमा"" as ""Katyur"" and specifies the context of social development for the mentioned groups, while the machine translation does not.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of location (mistakenly identifying Katyur as Qatar) and context (describing Katyur as a gothic region instead of specifying it as a place for social development).

- राधादी गोपिनीसँग (with Radha and Gopini)
- रासलिला गरेका (had quarreled)
- थिए (there)
- त कहिले (and sometimes)
- माता यशोदालाई (with mother Yashoda)

- Machine translation: ""Sometimes racialized with radical gopini, there was sometimes no demands for Mata Ishida.""
- Reference translation: ""Sometimes he had quarreled with Radha and Gopini, and sometimes, he annoyed his mother Yashoda by making unreasonable demands.""

Difference analysis:
- Machine translation incorrectly translates ""राधादी गोपिनीसँग"" as ""racialized with radical gopini,"" which is a misinterpretation of the context. The source text does not mention racialization but rather a conflict with Radha and Gopini.
- ""रासलिला गरेका"" is translated as ""there was sometimes no demands,"" which is not accurate. It should be translated as ""had quarreled"" or ""argued.""
- ""माता यशोदालाई भए नभएका"" is translated as ""for Mata Ishida,"" which is a misunderstanding. It should be translated as ""annoyed his mother Yashoda.""
- ""मागहरू"" is not translated in the machine translation, which is a crucial part of the sentence, referring to unreasonable demands.

|Reference translation: The three sons of Lalit were respectively Kesharsingh Bam, Kashi Bam, and Ratan Bam.|

Analysis:
1. **Subject**: The source text refers to ""तीनपुत्रहरु"" (three sons), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""three spoons"" (which is a utensil, not sons).
2. **Names**: The names ""क्रमस केशरसिह बम"" (Kesharsingh Bam), ""काँसी बम"" (Kashi Bam), and ""रतनबम"" (Ratan Bam) are not translated accurately. The machine translation attempts to interpret them as ""order chersieh bam"", ""brass bam"", and ""rabbit bam"", which are not the correct names or meanings.
3. **Structure**: The reference translation maintains the structure of the source, stating that the sons have these specific names, whereas the machine translation changes the meaning by associating the names with spoons.

2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""भरणी नक्षत्रको"" as ""the gender nonsense.""
3. The reference translation correctly identifies ""भरणी नक्षत्र"" (Bharani constellation).
4. The machine translation states that the person born in this ""nonsense"" worships the twins, while the reference translation says it is customary for them to worship the twin tree.
5. The reference translation also uses the term ""रुखलाई पूजा गर्ने"" (worship the twin tree) which is more accurate than the machine translation's ""variant of worshiping the twins.""

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the celestial body being referred to and the cultural practice associated with it. The machine translation introduces an incorrect concept of ""gender nonsense"" and a less precise description of the custom. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning and cultural context of the source text.

|Source: पंचकोशी तिर्थस्थल र साक्षात अग्निरुपको ज्वाला क्षेत्रको जिल्ला भएको कारणले पनि यस पर्वलाई बिशेष महत्वको साथ हेर्ने गरिन्छ ।|
|Machine translation: Due to the district of pachkoshi tirtha and the satya agnirup, this festival is also held with attention importance.|
|Reference translation: Due to the fact that Panchkoshi is a pilgrimage site and the district of Sakshat Agnirup, Jwala region, this festival is also considered with special significance.|

|Analysis|
1. **Panchkoshi tirtha**: In the source, ""तिर्थस्थल"" (tirtha) refers to a pilgrimage site, which is translated as ""pachkoshi tirtha"" in both machine and reference. However, the reference adds ""is"" to make it a complete sentence: ""Panchkoshi is a pilgrimage site.""
2. **Sākshat Agnirup**: The source mentions ""साक्षात अग्निरुपको"" (sākshat agnirupko), which is a compound referring to a specific area, ""Sakshat Agnirup"" in the reference. The machine translation omits the ""को"" (ko) and does not clarify the area, making it less clear.
3. **Jwala region**: The source implies the Jwala region by mentioning ""ज्वाला क्षेत्रको जिल्ला"" (jwala kshetrako jilla), but the machine translation does not explicitly mention the Jwala region. The reference includes this information, making it more precise.
4. **Bishेत्रko sāth**: The source uses ""बिशेत्रको साथ"" (bishेतrko sāth), which means ""with special significance"" in the context. The machine translation omits this phrase and replaces it with ""with attention importance,"" which is not as accurate.

In summary, the machine translation loses some context and precision, particularly in identifying the Jwala region and conveying the significance of the festival. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: तत्पश्चात विश्वामित्रले दुवै राजकुमारहरूलाई जनकपुर धाम लिएर गए।
Machine translation: Afterward the trustees took both princes, and brought them to Janakpur.

Step 2: Identify differences in word choice and structure.
- ""तत्पश्चात"" (Afterward) in the source is translated as ""Afterward"" in the machine translation, which is a suitable equivalent.
- ""विश्वामित्रले"" (Bishwamitra) is not explicitly mentioned in the machine translation, but the context suggests it should be referring to the same person. It's implied by ""the trustees"" (trustees).
- ""दुवै"" (both) is correctly translated as ""both"" in the machine translation.
- ""राजकुमारहरूलाई"" (of the princes) is translated as ""princes"" in the machine translation, but the possessive form is not explicitly stated.
- ""जनकपुर धाम"" (Janakpur) is translated as ""Janakpur"" in the machine translation, but the word order is different. The reference translation adds ""dham"" (place) to clarify it as ""Janakpurdham.""

Step 3: Evaluate the impact of these differences on meaning.
- The main subject and action are preserved, but the structure and some details are altered.
- The reference translation provides a clearer and more grammatically accurate translation, especially with the addition of ""dham"" to specify the location.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of word order and the explicit mention of Bishwamitra. The reference translation is more precise and faithful to the original Nepali text, while the machine translation could benefit from additional context and a more explicit translation of ""विश्वामित्रले"" to maintain accuracy.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: १४औं सताब्दीपछि हिन्दू धर्मलाई अनुसरणगर्न पुगेको भेटिन्छ ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: After the 14th century, Hinduism was founded to follow.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: After the 14th century, Hinduism was founded to be followed up.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation states ""Hinduism was founded to follow,"" which implies a passive action of following, while the reference translation adds ""to be followed up,"" which suggests an ongoing or future action of following.

Step 5: Analyze the issue
The main difference lies in the choice of verb and the implied meaning. The machine translation suggests a completed action, whereas the reference translation implies a continuous or planned action.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not convey the same sense of an ongoing or planned action of following Hinduism. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the intended meaning in English.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: अर्थात् रङ्गमञ्चमा कलाकारहरूद्वारा प्रस्तुत गरिएपछि मात्र नाटकले जीवन्तता पाउँछ।
Machine translation: Originally only after being presented by artists in color, the dance gets live.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
Difference 1: The source text uses ""रङ्गमञ्चमा"" which refers to a stage or a platform, while the machine translation uses ""in color"". This is a mistranslation, as ""रङ्गमञ्चमा"" is a more specific term for a stage.

Difference 2: The source text uses ""नाटकले"" which refers to a performance on stage, while the machine translation omits this context. The reference translation includes ""on stage"", which is crucial for understanding the context.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: Originally only after being presented by artists in color, the dance gets live.
Reference translation: Originally only after being presented by artists on stage, the dance gets live.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in two main ways: it incorrectly translates ""रङ्गमञ्चमा"" as ""in color"" instead of ""on stage"" and omits the context of ""नाटकले"" which is important for understanding the full meaning. The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately.

|Machine translation: Those areas consist of most punjabi hill states of the current northern state and the current Himachal Pradesh.|
|Reference translation: These areas include the present state of Uttarakhand and many of the present Punjabi hill states of the Himachal Pradesh.|

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""ती क्षेत्रहरू"" (These areas), which is correctly translated as ""Those areas"" in the machine translation.
2. The machine translation incorrectly uses ""current northern state"" instead of ""हालको उत्तराखण्ड राज्य"" (the present state of Uttarakhand). It omits the word ""हालको"" (present) and combines ""उत्तराखण्ड"" (Uttarakhand) with ""northern state"" which is not accurate.
3. The phrase ""हालको हिमाञ्चल प्रदेशका धेरै पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू"" (and many of the present Punjabi hill states of the Himachal Pradesh) is translated as ""and the current Himachal Pradesh"" in the machine translation. It misses the word ""पञ्जाबी पहाडी राज्यजहरू"" (Punjabi hill states) and the reference to ""हालको"" (present) Himachal Pradesh.
4. The machine translation ends with ""and the current Himachal Pradesh"", which should be ""and many of the present Punjabi hill states of the Himachal Pradesh"" to match the reference translation.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- Incorrectly combines ""Uttarakhand"" with ""northern state""
- Omits the word ""present"" (हालको) for both Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh
- Does not include the phrase ""Punjabi hill states"" and the reference to the present state of Himachal Pradesh

|Reference translation: You tell me such a way out of which all this wealth be destroyed. I can stay with peace only after this joy ends.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text starts with ""हजुरले कुनै यस्तो उपाय बताउनु हवस्"" which means ""Let the grandfather say anything"" in Nepali. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Let the grandfather say anything"", but omits the context and the meaning of asking for a solution.

2. The phrase ""जसबाट यी सम्पूर्ण धनसम्पत्ति नाश हवोस्"" means ""and let the whole treasure be destroyed"". The machine translation repeats ""joy"" multiple times, which is not a suitable translation for the destruction of wealth.

3. ""म यो वैभव समाप्त भएपछि"" means ""after this joy ends"". The machine translation again repeats ""joy"" and does not convey the idea of the end of a particular event.

4. ""मात्र आनन्दले बस्न पाउछु"" means ""I can stay with peace only"". The machine translation does not translate this part at all, losing the meaning of the speaker's desire for peace after the joy is over.

|Source: यस विषयमा रामायणले सबैभन्दा राम्रो व्याख्य गरेको देखिन्छ ।|
|Machine translation: Ramayana seems to be the best interested in this subject.|
|Reference translation: Ramayana seems to explained this topic the best of all way .|

**Analysis:**

1. **Subject and verb**: The source sentence uses ""रामायणले"" (Ramayana has) to indicate the action of explaining, while the machine translation incorrectly uses ""be interested in"" (which is passive and implies a preference rather than an explanation). The reference translation correctly uses ""explained"" (व्याख्य गरेको).

2. **Adverbial phrase**: The source sentence uses ""सबैभन्दा राम्रो"" (the best way among all) to describe the quality of the explanation. The machine translation omits this phrase, making it sound like Ramayana is simply the best without specifying how. The reference translation includes this phrase, providing a clearer comparison.

3. **Verb tense**: The source sentence uses the present tense ""देखिन्छ"" (seems), which is appropriate for a general statement. The machine translation maintains this tense, but the reference translation also uses the present tense.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the action (explaining vs. being interested), the adverbial phrase that emphasizes the quality of the explanation, and the clarity of the comparison. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuance of the original Nepali text.

|Reference translation: Like , Dhimdu , who lives on a steep slope , Melenden , who lives on a sloping place , and Chauden , who lives on the side of a hill |

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions three different names: सेपिलो पाटोमा (Cepilo potato), भिरालो ठाउँमा (a sloping place), and भीरको छेउमा (side of a hill).
2. The machine translation repeats the word ""virgin"" (भिरालो) multiple times, which is not present in the source or the reference translation. This is likely a mistake or a misinterpretation.
3. The machine translation does not capture the meaning of ""बस्ने"" (lives) correctly, as it is translated as ""who lived"" in a repetitive manner, while the reference translation uses ""who lives"" for each person.
4. The reference translation correctly translates the names and the context of living in specific locations, while the machine translation does not convey this meaning.

Step 1: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- किनकी (Why)
- उनी (he)
- जिवन जगत (world life)
- सम्बन्धी (related to)
- फरक दृष्टिकोण (different perspective)
- चाहन्थे (wanted to know)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: 
- Because he wanted to know (किनकी उनी जान्न चाहन्थे)
- from a different perspective (फरक दृष्टिकोणबाट)
- relating to living (जिवन जगत सम्बन्धी)

Reference translation:
- Because he wanted to know (किनकी उनी जान्न चाहन्थे)
- from a different point of view (फरक दृष्टिकोण)
- about the world life (विश्व जीवन)

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation uses ""relating to living"" (जिवन जगत सम्बन्धी), which is a bit awkward and does not convey the same meaning as the reference's ""about the world life"" (विश्व जीवन). The reference translation is more precise and clear.
- The machine translation uses ""from a different perspective"" (फरक दृष्टिकोणबाट), which is correct but less idiomatic than the reference's ""from a different point of view"" (फरक दृष्टिकोण). The reference is more commonly used in English.

Conclusion: The machine translation has a slight difference in the choice of words and phrasing, which affects the clarity and precision of the translation. The reference translation is more accurate and natural in conveying the intended meaning.

|Machine translation: The patriarch is typically used in the worship of Anwar and the gods.|
|Reference translation: Dhamari is specially found to be used in nwaran and in God 's place of worship.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Subject identification**: The source text talks about ""धमारी"" (Dhamari), a musical instrument, while the machine translation incorrectly refers to it as ""the patriarch,"" which is a term for an elder male figure, not an instrument.

2. **Contextual difference**: The source mentions ""न्वारन"" (nwaran), which is likely a specific context or event related to the instrument's use, but the machine translation does not provide this context, instead referring to ""Anwar,"" which is a different term and does not fit the Nepali context.

3. **God's place of worship**: The source uses ""देवताको पूजा स्थानमा"" (in God's place of worship), which is a more accurate translation of the Nepali phrase than the machine translation's ""worship of the gods,"" which omits the specific reference to the place.

4. **Adverb ""खास गरी"" (specially found)**: The machine translation does not include this adverb, which emphasizes the uniqueness or special use of Dhamari in the given context.

The machine translation differs from the reference translation in several ways:
1. It does not include the Nepali date ""मे २००७ मा"" (May 2007).
2. It combines ""म + एम'स टूर"" (M + M's Tour) with ""हाउस अफ ब्लूजको"" (House of Blues), which is not accurate.
3. It omits the reference to the ""सभागृहमा"" (auditorium) part, which is crucial for understanding the location.

|Source: सञ्ज्यालहरू गौतम गोत्री, हिन्दू ब्राह्मण भएकाले यिनीहरू हिन्दू परम्पराका सबै चाड पर्वहरू, संस्कारहरू मान्ने गर्दछन् ।|
|Machine translation: As the communities grew, Hindu Brahmins would consider all the feasts of Hindu traditions, respectively.|
|Reference translation: Since the Sanjyals are Gautam tribes, Hindu Brahmins, they observe all the festivals and rituals of the Hindu tradition.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject identification**: The source text mentions ""सञ्ज्यालहरू"" (Sanjyals) as the subject, while the machine translation omits this context, referring to ""Hindu Brahmins"" as the subject. The reference translation correctly identifies the Sanjyals as the main subject.
2. **Gautam tribes**: The source specifies that Sanjyals are Gautam tribes, but the machine translation does not include this detail. The reference translation includes this information.
3. **Observance of festivals and rituals**: The source states that Sanjyals ""मान्ने गर्दछन्"" (observe or consider), while the machine translation simplifies it to ""would consider"" without specifying the act of observation. The reference translation accurately conveys the act of observing.
4. **Sentence structure**: The source text has a more direct structure, while the machine translation rephrases it, potentially losing some nuance. The reference translation maintains a similar structure to the source.

Overall, the machine translation is missing important context about the Sanjyals being Gautam tribes and the act of observation, while the reference translation captures these aspects more accurately. The machine translation also changes the sentence structure slightly, which affects the clarity of the original meaning.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: तर यस शब्दले प्राकृतिक स्रोतबापतको भुक्तानीलाई जनाउने छैन ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: But this word will not indicate the payment of natural resources.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: But this term does not refer to payment for natural resources.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""indicate"" which might imply that the word is not clear or gives a wrong impression about the payment, while the reference translation uses ""refer to"" which is more precise and suggests that the term lacks the specific connection to payment for natural resources.
- The source text uses ""भुक्तानीलाई जनाउने"" (to bring into existence or to introduce), which is not directly translated in the machine translation, whereas the reference translation captures the idea by saying ""payment for"" (referring to).

Step 5: Identify differences
- The machine translation is less precise in conveying the meaning that the term does not specifically relate to the payment aspect.
- The source text's nuance about bringing something into existence is not captured in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its choice of words and the level of precision in conveying the meaning that the term does not specifically address the payment for natural resources. The reference translation is more accurate in this context.

|Source: जब हाम्रो जीवनमा संसारका सबै प्राणीको हितको भाव जाग्रत हुन्छ तब त्यही भावले हामीलाई पवित्र बनाउछ ।|
|Machine translation: When all the living creatures of the world are sanctified in our lives, the same creature is sanctified in our sight.|
|Reference translation: When the sense of well-being of all beings in the world is awakened in our lives, then the same sense makes us pure.|

Analysis:
1. **""हाम्रो जीवनमा""** (in our lives) - Machine translation: ""in our lives""
   Reference translation: ""in our lives""
   Both translations are consistent.

2. **""संसारका सबै प्राणीको हितको भाव""** (the sense of well-being of all beings) - Machine translation: ""all the living creatures of the world""
   Reference translation: ""the sense of well-being of all beings""
   The machine translation is not precise, as it translates ""well-being"" as ""living creatures"" which is a broader term.

3. **""जाग्रत हुन्छ""** (awakened) - Machine translation: ""are sanctified""
   Reference translation: ""is awakened""
   The machine translation uses ""sanctified"" which does not convey the same meaning as ""awakened"" in this context.

4. **""भावले हामीलाई पवित्र बनाउछ""** (the same sense makes us pure) - Machine translation: ""the same creature is sanctified in our sight""
   Reference translation: ""then the same sense makes us pure""
   The machine translation is not accurate, as it focuses on the physical ""sight"" and does not convey the idea of becoming pure due to the awakened sense.

In summary, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of the specific meaning of ""well-being"" and the concept of becoming ""pure"" due to the awakened sense, rather than just the physical presence of creatures. The reference translation captures the emotional and spiritual aspect of the original Nepali text, which the machine translation does not.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: निष्पक्ष र निदर भई पूरा इमान्दारीका साथ ठीकठीक तरिकाले अथवा भनूँ वस्तुगत ढङ्गले तिनका

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Conscientiously or with full integrity, and with full integrity, and with full integrity, and with goodness,

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Fairly and fearlessly, with complete honesty, in a fair way or in an objective way, their

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation attempts to convey the idea of being impartial and honest, but it does so in a repetitive and awkward manner, using ""with full integrity"" multiple times.
- The reference translation, on the other hand, is more concise and clear, using ""fairly and fearlessly"" to express the same concept of being unbiased and courageous.
- The machine translation also omits the word ""निदर"" (fearlessly) from the source, which is present in the reference translation.
- The phrase ""तिनका"" (of theirs) is not translated in the machine translation, while it is included in the reference translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of repetition, clarity, and the inclusion of key phrases. The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately and effectively, conveying the idea of impartiality, honesty, and fairness in a more natural and precise manner.

|Source: मोतीरामपछि विभिन्न लेखकहरूले नेपाली भाषामा नाटकको अनुवाद गर्ने परम्परालाई अगाडि बढाएको देखिए पनि नाटकमा मौलिक लेखन भने आउन सकेको थिएन।|
|Machine translation: After Motiram, several writers seemed to have fronted the tradition of translating the dance into nepali, even if the original writer could not come to the dance.|
|Reference translation: After Moti Ram , though various writers seem to have carried forward the tradition of translating plays into Nepali , original writings could not come in plays .|

|Analysis|
1. **""विभिन्न लेखकहरूले""** (various writers) - Machine translation: ""several writers"" is accurate, but it omits the word ""हरूले"" (plural form) which is important for context.
2. **""नेपाली भाषामा नाटकको अनुवाद""** (translating plays into Nepali) - Machine translation: Incorrectly translated as ""translating the dance into Nepali"". The source refers to plays, not dances.
3. **""परम्परालाई अगाडि बढाएको""** (carried forward the tradition) - Machine translation: Accurate, but the word order is slightly different.
4. **""नाटकमा मौलिक लेखन भने आउन सकेको""** (original writings could not come in plays) - Machine translation: Incorrectly translated as ""even if the original writer could not come to the dance"". It should be about original writings not being present in plays.

|Source: विषयवस्तु र शिल्पका दृष्टिले यस अवधिक, नरसिंह अवतार देवासुर सङ्ग्राम, दोभान, मृत्युञ्जय आदि उत्कृष्ट महाकाव्यहरू हुन् ।|
|Machine translation: The theme and shilp's perspective are this periodical, nursery Avatar Devasur Collection, Dovan, death park etc.|
|Reference translation: Avadik , Narasimha Awataar Dewaasur Sanggram , Dobhaan , Mrityunjaya etc are brilliant epic from subject and skill perspective.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Source**: The source text is in Nepali, discussing various literary works (Narasimha Awataar Devasur Sanggram, Dobhaan, Mrityunjaya) from a specific perspective (विषयवस्तु र शिल्पका दृष्टिले) which means ""from the subject and skill point of view.""

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation attempts to convey the same idea but with some errors. It incorrectly translates ""विषयवस्तु"" as ""periodical"" (which is not a direct translation), ""शिल्पका दृष्टिले"" as ""nursery"" (which is a misinterpretation), and ""देवासुर सङ्ग्राम"" as ""Avatar Devasur Collection"" (which is a literal but not accurate translation). It also combines ""Dovan"" and ""death park"" without context, which is not a correct interpretation.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation accurately captures the meaning, mentioning ""Avadik"" (a term that likely refers to a specific collection or genre), ""Narasimha Awataar Dewaasur Sanggram,"" ""Dobhaan,"" and ""Mrityunjaya"" as examples of ""brilliant epics"" from the ""subject and skill perspective.""

In conclusion, the machine translation has several inaccuracies, including incorrect translations and a lack of context, while the reference translation provides a more accurate and coherent representation of the source text. The differences lie in the interpretation of ""विषयवस्तु"" and ""शिल्पका दृष्टिले,"" as well as the handling of the specific literary works and their context.

|Source: लोककथाहरूको अनुसार, राजा पत्रकलाई पटनाको जनक भनिन्छ।|
|Machine translation: According to the lochs, the king's letter is called the letter of the pot.|
|Reference translation: According to folklore, Raja Patrak is called the king of Patna.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference in context**: The machine translation refers to ""lochs"" which is likely a mistranslation or a misunderstanding of the term ""लोककथाहरू"" (folklore). The reference translation correctly uses the term ""folklore"" to describe the source of the information.

2. **Difference in noun translation**: ""राजा पत्रकलाई"" (king's letter) is translated to ""the king's letter of the pot"" in the machine translation, which is a literal and incorrect interpretation. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""Raja Patrak"" (king's name).

3. **Missing information**: The machine translation does not convey the meaning that Raja Patrak is specifically associated with Patna, as mentioned in the source.

4. **Grammar**: The machine translation has awkward phrasing (""the letter of the pot"") which does not make sense in the context of the Nepali sentence.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of context, noun translation, and overall meaning. The reference translation better captures the essence of the source text.

|Machine translation: John smokes extensively on them the Tc1 Lymphosite is shamilite and eosionophil is shamilite in some people who are COPD, as in dam.|
|Reference translation: Those people who smoke excessively contain Tc1 lymphocytes and some people with COPD, such as asthma, contain eosinophils.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject**: The source text refers to ""jo mānīsaharu"" (those people) while the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""John"" (which is a proper noun and not a general term for people).
2. **Action**: The source uses ""अतिरिक्त रूपमा धुम्रपान"" (excessively smoking) which is not translated accurately as ""John smokes extensively on them"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""smoke excessively.""
3. **Tc1 Lymphocytes**: The source states that these cells are ""shāmilita"" (present) in those who smoke excessively. The machine translation incorrectly uses ""shamilite"" which is likely a typo or incorrect word choice.
4. **COPD and Eosinophils**: The source mentions that some people with COPD have ""इओसिओनोफिल"" (eosinophils). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""eosionophil is shamilite"" and omits the connection to COPD. The reference translation correctly connects eosinophils to COPD (such as asthma) and maintains the context.

In summary, the machine translation has several issues, including incorrect subject, inaccurate translation of the smoking action, and a lack of clarity regarding the relationship between Tc1 lymphocytes, COPD, and eosinophils. The reference translation provides a more accurate and coherent representation of the source text.

|Machine translation: It was so hurt for the peace with the deaf that the oath of posts came to call for warships and conversations without the oath of posts.|
|Reference translation: Deuba was in such a rush for peace talks with the Maoists that he called for a ceasefire and talks before taking the oath of office.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject**: The source mentions ""देउवा"" (Deuba), but the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""the deaf"" as the subject, which is not accurate.
2. **Action**: The source states that Deuba was ""हतारिएका"" (in a rush) for peace talks, while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""so hurt"" for peace, which does not convey the urgency.
3. **Purpose**: The source mentions ""पदको शपथ ग्रहण"" (taking the oath of office) as the context for the actions, but the machine translation omits this and instead talks about ""the oath of posts"" coming to call for warships and conversations, which is a misinterpretation.
4. **Actions described**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""नगरी युद्धविराम"" (ceasefire) as ""warships,"" which is a literal mistranslation. The reference translation correctly states that Deuba called for a ceasefire.
5. **Sequence of events**: The machine translation suggests that the call for warships and conversations was made before taking the oath, which is not supported by the source. The reference translation correctly places the call for a ceasefire and talks before the oath.

In summary, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of subject, action, context, and sequence of events, leading to a poor quality translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning and intent of the source text.

|Source: 2011 मा संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिकाको अस्पतालमा COPD महँगो अवस्थाहरू मध्येमा पर्दथ्यो, जहाँ कूल $5.7 अरबको खर्च भएको थियो।|
|Machine translation: In 2011, COPD was among the highest constituencies in the United States voluntarily, where a total of $ 5.7 was spent on Arabia.|
|Reference translation: In 2011, COPD was one of the most expensive cases in the United States that cost a total of $ 5.7 billion.|

**Analysis:**

1. **COPD context**: The source text mentions ""COPD महँगो अवस्थाहरू"" (COPD in expensive conditions), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""highest constituencies"" (which implies a political context, not medical conditions). The reference translation correctly identifies COPD as a medical condition.

2. **Voluntary vs. medical cost**: The source text does not specify whether the high cost is due to voluntary treatment or the overall cost of treating COPD patients. The machine translation incorrectly implies that it was a voluntary situation, while the reference translation does not make this assumption and simply states the cost.

3. **Amount spent**: The source text uses ""खर्च भएको"" (cost), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""spent on Arabia,"" which is unrelated to the context. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""cost a total of $5.7 billion.""

4. **Quantity**: The source text mentions ""कूल $5.7 अरब"" (total $5.7 billion), which is the correct unit for such a large amount. The machine translation omits this context, making it unclear. The reference translation includes the correct unit.

In summary, the machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the context of COPD as a medical condition, the lack of mention of voluntary treatment, and the incorrect interpretation of the cost. The reference translation provides a more accurate and faithful representation of the source text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Who is this with the children that are there, whose son, how took my name?

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: He asked the children there that who this is, whose son is he, how did he sue my name?

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation correctly identifies the subject as asking about someone with the children (त्यहाँ भएका केटाकेटीहरूसँग) and inquires about the person's identity (को हो) and connection to the speaker (कसको छोरो हो).
- However, there is a difference in the verb ""लियो"" (took) in the source, which should be translated as ""sued"" (in the context of asking a question) in the reference translation. The machine translation incorrectly uses ""took"" instead of ""sued"" (how did he sue my name?).
- The reference translation also adds the interrogative structure ""how did he"" before ""sued my name,"" which is not present in the machine translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation has a significant difference in the verb choice, using ""took"" instead of ""sued,"" which changes the meaning of the question. Additionally, the reference translation includes an interrogative structure that is not present in the machine translation, making it more natural and clear in the context. The overall quality of the machine translation could be improved by addressing these issues.

|Machine translation: Ambrose has also played a movie in the role of John s. Lockdown in a Hollywood movie.|
|Reference translation: Ambrose has also played the role of John Shaw in a hollywood movie Lockdown.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""एम्ब्रोजले"" (Ambrose), which is correctly translated as ""Ambrose"" in both the machine and reference translations.
2. The source text refers to ""एक हलिउड चलचित्र"" (a Hollywood movie), which is also accurately translated as ""a Hollywood movie"" in both translations.
3. The source text has ""लकडाउनमा पनि जोन सको"" (John s. Lockdown), where ""लकडाउनमा"" is a typo or a misinterpretation, likely meant to be ""लकडाउन"" (Lockdown) and ""पनि जोन"" (John s) is a name with a surname. The machine translation combines these into ""John s. Lockdown,"" which is incorrect. The reference translation separates them as ""John Shaw.""
4. The source text does not specify a possessive form for ""जोन"" (John), but the reference translation adds ""Shaw"" as a surname, which is a common way to provide more context in English translations.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- Incorrectly combining ""लकडाउन"" and ""पनि जोन"" into ""John s. Lockdown.""
- The reference translation adds ""Shaw"" as a surname for clarity, which is not present in the machine translation.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should be revised to: ""Ambrose has also played the role of John Shaw in the Hollywood movie Lockdown.""

|Machine translation: Thy father shall go up to heaven, if thou be mysterious, if thou be mysterious.|
|Reference translation: In this way, if you fast on this Ekadashi without any laziness, your father will reach heaven for sure.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text starts with ""यसप्रकारले"" (In this way), which is missing in the machine translation, making the sentence structure less clear.
2. ""तिमीले"" (if you) is translated as ""thy father"" in the machine translation, which is a misinterpretation of the subject.
3. ""आलस्य रहित"" (without any laziness) is translated as ""mysterious"" twice, which is a literal and incorrect translation of the original meaning.
4. ""भई यस एकादशीको व्रत गर्यौ"" (fast on this Ekadashi) is not accurately translated, with ""mysterious"" being used instead of the action of fasting.
5. ""तिम्रा पिता"" (your father) is translated correctly, but the context of the sentence is lost due to the earlier errors.
6. ""अवश्य"" (for sure) is missing in the machine translation, which weakens the certainty expressed in the reference translation.

Analysis:
1. **Subject of the sentence**: The source sentence is about ""नेपाली कम्युनिष्ट सशस्त्र संघर्षको इतिहास"" (history of the Nepali communist armed struggle), while the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""nepalese communist ssr"" which is not a standard term. The reference translation correctly uses ""Nepali communist armed struggle.""
2. **Adjective for information**: The source uses ""मात्र छ"" (only), which is translated as ""it is very subjective"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate. The correct adjective in the reference translation is ""very incomplete.""
3. **Verb for the answer**: The source uses ""छ भने त्यो"" (it is), which implies a statement, while the machine translation uses ""it is very subjective to reply,"" which is a different context. The reference translation uses ""it is a very incomplete answer,"" which is a more suitable response.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the subject, the adjective for the information, and the verb for the answer. The machine translation is not accurate and does not convey the intended meaning of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: र त्यहा बाट  शिकार् गर्न भारतको उत्तर् पूर्वि पहाड् तिर आये र त्यहाको कैलाश पहाड्मा केही बर्स बसेको इतिहास् म पड्न पाइन्छ्.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: And as for the hills of India, and as for the grey hills of India, I have found the history of the hills of India.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: From there , they came to the northeastern hills of India to hunt , and there is a history of them staying in the Kailash hills for a few years .

Step 4: Compare the differences
1. The machine translation omits the verb ""आये"" (came) and the context of ""शिकार् गर्न"" (to hunt), which is important for understanding the action.
2. The machine translation adds ""grey hills"" which is not present in the source text, while the reference translation refers to ""उत्तर् पूर्वि पहाड्"" (northeastern hills).
3. The machine translation does not mention ""कैलाश पहाड्मा"" (Kailash hills) or the duration of their stay, which are included in the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of missing important context (action of hunting and specific location), adding unnecessary information (grey hills), and not including details about the Kailash hills and the duration of their stay. The quality of the translation could be improved by capturing the meaning and context more accurately.

1. The source text refers to ""उत्तरको क्षेत्रमा"" (in the area of the north), which is translated to ""In the area of the north"" in both the machine and reference translations. This part is consistent.
2. The source mentions ""त पहाडका मानिसहरुको गोठ गोथेरी"" (the people of the hills' gathering or settlement), which is translated to ""a shepherd of the hills"" in the machine translation. The reference translation, however, says ""the people of the hills"" and specifies that they had started settling, which is ""सुरु भइसकेको"" (had already started) in the source.
3. The machine translation omits the specific location ""गोथ गोथेरी"" and instead says ""there was something that was started,"" which is not as clear as the reference translation's ""somewhere called Goth Gotheri.""

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- It translates the people of the hills' gathering or settlement as a shepherd, while the reference keeps it as the people.
- It does not mention the specific location ""Goth Gotheri"" and instead implies a more general ""something started.""

To improve the quality, the machine translation should be revised to: ""In the northern region, the people of the hills had already started settling in a place called Goth Gotheri.""

|Source: भौमासुरको जेलमा बन्दी भएका ती १६ हजार राजकुमारीहरूले पनि कृष्णसँग विवाह गर्ने इछ्छा जताएकाले कृष्णले ती राजकुमारीहरूलाई पनि विवाह गरेका थिए ।|
|Machine translation: Those 16 thousand princes who were close in the prison of phaimasur also married mercenaries.|
|Reference translation: Krishna had also married those 16 thousand princesses who were imprisoned in Bhaumasur prison as they had expressed their wish to marry Krishna.|
|Analysis:|
1. **Subject identification**: The source mentions ""भौमासुरको जेलमा बन्दी"" (princesses imprisoned in Bhaumasur's prison), while the machine translation incorrectly refers to them as ""princes"" (princes who were close in the prison of phaimasur). This is a significant difference, as the context is about princesses, not princes.
2. **Action description**: The source states that the princesses ""जताएकाले कृष्णले ती राजकुमारीहरूलाई पनि विवाह गरेका थिए"" (had their wish to marry Krishna fulfilled by Krishna), whereas the machine translation incorrectly suggests that they ""married mercenaries."" This is a crucial difference, as the action is about Krishna marrying the princesses, not the other way around.
3. **Context**: The machine translation loses the context of the princesses expressing their desire to marry Krishna, which is a key part of the story.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of subject, action, and context. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning that Krishna married the imprisoned princesses based on their wish, while the machine translation incorrectly translates the subject and the nature of the marriage.

|Reference translation: In a series on October 8, CM Punk confronted McMahon while he was speaking.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""एक श्रृङ्खलामा"" (a series), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it is translated as ""one episode of the show,"" which is a possible interpretation but loses the context of a series.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""सिएम पङ्कले"" (CM Punk) as ""cm punk,"" which omits the full name and capitalization.
3. The machine translation adds ""while mcmen spoke"" which is not present in the source text. The reference translation implies the encounter happened during McMahon's speech, but it does not specify who was speaking.

|Source: यसलाई पानीमा भिजाएपछि वा माटोमा रोपेपछि रेडिकल जरा भएर अनि प्लमुल डाक्ला भएर बढ्छ।|
|Machine translation: After planting it in water, or in clay, the radical roots increase, and the plumulus dacla.|
|Reference translation: When it is soaked in water or planted in the soil, it grows by radical roots and plum buds.|

Analysis:
1. **Time frame**: The source text uses ""भएर बढ्छ"" (it grows), which implies a continuous process, while the machine translation uses ""increase"" which suggests a completed action. The reference translation correctly uses ""it grows"" to indicate a continuous process.
2. **Soaking vs. Planting**: The source text mentions ""पानीमा भिजाएपछि"" (after being planted in water) and ""माटोमा रोपेपछि"" (after being planted in clay), which are two separate actions. The machine translation combines these into ""in water, or in clay,"" but the reference translation separates them more clearly with ""soaked in water"" and ""planted in the soil.""
3. **Term translation**: ""रेडिकल जरा"" (radical roots) is correctly translated as ""radical roots"" in both the machine and reference translations. However, ""प्लमुल डाक्ला"" (plumulus dacla) is not a standard term in English. The machine translation uses ""plumulus dacla"" as is, while the reference translation translates it as ""plum buds,"" which is a more accurate and understandable term.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the time frame description, the separation of soaking and planting, and the translation of ""प्लमुल डाक्ला"" (which is not a standard term). The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

|Thought: The machine translation has a difference in the choice of words and structure compared to the reference translation.|
|Analysis:|
1. **""त्यसपछि"" (After that)**: The machine translation uses ""then"" which is a direct translation, but the reference keeps the original phrase, which implies a specific point in time after a previous event.
2. **""कार्यकाल सुरु गर्ने"" (to start his career)**: The machine translation translates this as ""start his acting career,"" which adds the context of ""acting"" which is not explicitly mentioned in the source. The reference simply says ""start his tenure,"" which is a more general term for beginning a period of work.
3. **""निर्णय गरेका"" (decided)**: The machine translation uses ""decided to"" while the reference omits the ""to"" and keeps it as ""decided,"" which is a more natural phrasing in English.

Overall, the machine translation adds unnecessary context (acting career) and omits the more general term ""tenure"" in the reference translation, which might lead to a slightly less accurate representation of the source text. The reference translation maintains a clearer and more faithful translation of the original Nepali sentence.|

|Reference translation: The red tika of white Akshata dyed with Majitho's red color, cows milk's curd should be taken.|

|Analysis|
1. **Majitho's red color**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""रङमा गाईको"" (the red color of the egg) as ""red color of the egg"" without specifying that it's the color associated with the festival or event (Majitho). The reference translation correctly mentions ""Majitho's red color.""

2. **Cows milk's curd**: The machine translation uses ""a tie of coloured red, white axes"" which is a literal and incorrect interpretation of ""दूधको दही"" (cows milk's curd). The reference translation correctly translates this as ""cows milk's curd.""

3. **Red tika**: The machine translation refers to a ""tie"" which is a misinterpretation of ""टीका"" (tika, a traditional red mark or ornament). The reference translation correctly uses ""red tika.""

4. **Action**: The machine translation suggests an action of wearing a tie, which is not the intended meaning. The reference translation correctly states that the red tika should be applied to the curd.

In summary, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of cultural context, specificity of the red color, and the intended action. The reference translation captures the meaning more accurately and contextually.

|Analysis:|
1. **Subject and context**: The source text mentions ""सरदार पटेल"" (Sardar Patel), a specific historical figure, which is not clearly identified in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly refers to ""Big leaders like Sardar Patel.""
2. **Adjective for leaders**: The source uses ""ठुला"" (big) to describe the leaders, which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation captures this by saying ""Big leaders.""
3. **Fear**: The source uses ""डर थियो"" (had a fear) to express the emotion, which is translated as ""was afraid to"" in the machine translation. The reference translation also conveys this same emotion.
4. **Action and condition**: The source text describes the fear as a hypothetical situation, ""यदि यो धन पाकिस्तानलाई दिइयो"" (if this wealth was given to Pakistan).

|Machine translation: An alternative is the journal of care, sustainability, energy, power, and solarity.|
|Reference translation: Vedic period is the confluence of sadhana, siddhi, samathrya, energy, and pride.|

|Analysis|
1. **Sahana (साधना)**: The machine translation has ""journal of care"" which is not an accurate representation of the original term ""sahana"" which refers to spiritual practices or efforts in the Vedic context.
2. **Siddhi (सिद्धि)**: The machine translation uses ""care"" instead of ""siddhi,"" which refers to the accomplishment or attainment of a spiritual goal, not a general sense of care.
3. **Samathrya (सामथ्र्य)**: The machine translation omits this term, which is not present in the English reference translation but could be translated as ""equanimity"" or ""balance"" in the context of spiritual development.
4. **Shakti (शक्ति)**: The machine translation has ""power,"" which is a general term and does not capture the spiritual or energetic connotation of ""shakti"" in the original Nepali text.
5. **Suryatā (सौर्यताको)**: The machine translation has ""solarity,"" which is a specific term referring to the sun's energy, but the original phrase suggests a broader connection to the sun's qualities, not just solar energy.
6. **Pride (प्रियता)**: The machine translation includes ""pride,"" which is not present in the reference translation. The original term ""pride"" might be a misinterpretation or a lost in translation, as it does not fit the context of the Vedic period.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the spiritual and cultural context, as well as the specific terms used. The translation should focus on conveying the confluence of spiritual practices, accomplishments, balance, and the sun's qualities, rather than a journal or a list of unrelated concepts.

|Reference translation: The support of the Mavals later proved to be as important for Shivaji Maharaj as the support of Afghans was for Sher Shah Suri.|

Analysis:
1. **Subject and verb**: The source text refers to ""मावलहरुको सहयोग"" (the support of the Mavals) as the subject, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""Shivaji Maharaj, the assistant of Mauls."" The reference translation correctly identifies the subject as ""the support of the Mavals.""
2. **Temporal expression**: The source uses ""पछि उति"" (later) to indicate the timing, which is not translated accurately in the machine translation. It is missing from the English version, making the context unclear.
3. **Comparison**: The source text uses ""साबित भयो"" (proved to be important) to express the equivalence between the Mavals' support and the Afghans' support for Sher Shah Suri. The machine translation omits this comparison, stating it as ""as with afghano for Shershah Suri,"" which is not a proper comparison.
4. **Proper nouns**: The machine translation does not capitalize ""Shivaji Maharaj"" and ""Sher Shah Suri,"" which is a common mistake in machine translations but not a significant issue for understanding the meaning.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of subject identification, temporal expression, and proper comparison, while the capitalization of proper nouns is a minor issue.

Analysis:

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of time expression, subject, and the method of formation.

|Reference translation: Kalsarpa Yoga is a bad yoga according to astrology due to which human beings get only 25 percent of the good fruits that they should get from other good yogas.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Translation of key terms**: The machine translation mistranslates ""कालसर्प योग"" (Kalsarpa Yoga) as ""Kalsharp sum"", which is incorrect. The reference translation correctly identifies it as a yoga.
2. **Concept of yoga**: The machine translation refers to ""good sums"" instead of ""yoga,"" which is a significant difference in meaning. The reference translation correctly uses the term ""yoga.""

The reference translation clarifies that it's specifically about the 25 percent they get from Kalsarpa Yoga compared to other good yogas.

Reference translation: Your enemies will insult you saying abuses for your manhood , what could be more painful for you than that ?

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""तिम्रा"" (thy) and ""तिम्रो"" (your) interchangeably, which is not entirely accurate in this context. In the source, ""तिम्रा"" is more formal, while ""तिम्रो"" is more casual or direct.
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""तिम्रो पुरुषार्थको उपहास"" (insults for your manhood), which is crucial for conveying the meaning of the original text.
- The machine translation also changes the structure of the sentence, making it less clear about the cause and effect (the pain caused by the insults) compared to the reference translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of formality, the specific phrase ""तिम्रो पुरुषार्थको उपहास,"" and the overall sentence structure, which affects the clarity of the meaning. The reference translation better captures the intended meaning and tone of the source text.

|im_sep|>|im_left|Reference translation:|<|im_sep|>|im_right|The distribution of profits from the body is further explained in paragraph 13 of this directive.|

Analysis:
1. **Subject**: In the source, ""निकायबाट मुनाफाको बितरण"" (profit distribution from the agency) is translated to ""the additional barrier relating to the distribution of profits from the agency"" in the machine translation. The reference translation uses ""the distribution of profits from the body"" which is more accurate, as ""निकाय"" can also refer to a body or organization, not just an agency.
2. **Verb**: The source uses ""गरिएको छ"" (explained) which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it says ""is done,"" which is not the most suitable verb for this context. The reference translation uses ""further explained,"" which conveys the same meaning as the source.
3. **Article**: The source uses ""यसै"" (this) to refer to the directive, but the machine translation omits it. The reference translation includes ""this directive,"" which is more precise.

Overall, the machine translation has differences in subject specificity, verb choice, and the inclusion of an article. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali text.

|Machine translation: And she went up into the river of Vernkolagh, one day, with the call of the tradition.|
|Reference translation: One day Parashuram 's mother took an urn and went to the river to fetch water.|

Analysis:
1. **Subject and action**: In the source, the subject is ""परशुरामकी माता"" (Parashuram's mother) and the action is ""जल भर्नकोलागी नदीमा गइन्"" (went to the river to fetch water). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""with the call of the tradition"" instead of describing the action of fetching water.
2. **Object**: The source mentions ""कलश"" (urn) as the object, which is not translated in the machine translation. Instead, it refers to ""the river of Vernkolagh"" as if it's the object of fetching.
3. **Sentence structure**: The reference translation maintains a more direct and clear sentence structure, while the machine translation rephrases the sentence in a way that loses the original meaning.

Overall, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of accurately conveying the action of fetching water with an urn and preserving the original sentence structure.

|Machine translation: Then cut the lines of telephones and mobiles across the country.|
|Reference translation: Then the lines of telephones and mobiles cut out across the country.|

|Analysis|
1. The verb ""काटिए"" (cut) in the source text is in the past tense, which implies an action that has already taken place. In the machine translation, the verb ""cut"" is translated as ""cut"" in the present tense, which suggests an ongoing action rather than a completed one.
2. The machine translation uses ""across the country"" as a prepositional phrase, while the reference translation uses ""cut out"" to convey the idea of interruption or disconnection, which is more appropriate in this context.
3. The reference translation omits the word ""तथा"" (and) between ""telephones"" and ""mobiles,"" which is not essential in the English sentence and does not change the meaning.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of tense (past vs. present) and the choice of phrasing to convey the idea of interruption. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the intended meaning of the Nepali sentence.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: सम्राट नै प्रधान न्यायाधीश, मुख्य सेनापति र कानुनका वास्तविक विधाता थिए।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The contestant was a prominent judge, major captain, and real estate defender of law.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The emperor was the chief justice, the chief of staff, and the actual legislator.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- In the source text, ""सम्राट"" refers to ""emperor"" (the subject), while in the machine translation, it is translated as ""contestant"", which is incorrect.
- ""नै प्रधान न्यायाधीश"" means ""the chief justice"" in Nepali, but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""prominent judge.""
- ""मुख्य सेनापति"" means ""chief of staff"" in Nepali, which is accurate in the machine translation.
- ""र कानुनका वास्तविक विधाता"" means ""and the actual legislator"" (referring to the role related to law), but the machine translation omits this part and instead adds ""real estate defender of law,"" which is not accurate.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly captures the roles of the emperor as the chief justice, chief of staff, and actual legislator.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of identifying the subject as the emperor and accurately translating the roles of ""chief justice"" and ""actual legislator."" The translation should be: ""The emperor was the chief justice, the chief of staff, and the actual legislator.""

|Source: कोही विषुलिङ्गी भए ऊ मा आफ्नो यौनाङ्ग परिवर्तन शल्यक्रिया गर्ने चाहना हुन्छ।|
|Machine translation: Someone who is poisoned is willing to respond to his sexual desires.|
|Reference translation: If someone is heterosexual, they have a desire to have their genital transformation surgery.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text is about a specific condition (being ""vishulingi"" or non-binary) and the desire for a surgical procedure related to it, which is a sexual/gender-affirming surgery.
2. The machine translation incorrectly interprets ""विषुलिङ्गी"" as ""poisoned,"" which is a misunderstanding of the term. In this context, ""vishulingi"" refers to a non-binary gender identity, not a state of being poisoned.
3. The machine translation also incorrectly translates ""यौनाङ्ग परिवर्तन शल्यक्रिया"" as ""responding to sexual desires,"" which is not the intended meaning. The phrase refers to the surgical transformation of genitals, not a response to desires.
4. The reference translation correctly translates ""vishulingi"" as ""heterosexual"" (which is not the correct term for the source context, but it's a common interpretation in English), and accurately conveys the desire for a ""genital transformation surgery.""

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation due to incorrect interpretation of the term ""vishulingi"" and a misunderstanding of the context, leading to a completely different meaning. The reference translation, while not entirely accurate in the source context, is closer to the intended message than the machine translation.

**Analysis:**

2. **Machine Translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""विशिष्ट पुख्यौली"" (specific equipment) as ""specialty equipment"" and omits the context of the social customs. It also introduces ""maneuvering"" three times, which is not present in the source text.
3. **Reference Translation**: The reference translation captures the essence of the source, mentioning ""social culture and practices"" and the unique ""ancestry and social culture"" of the Tamang community.

The machine translation loses the meaning of the original text, particularly in the context of social customs, and introduces unnecessary elements. The reference translation is a more accurate representation of the source.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: त्यसमा आग्रह वा पूर्वाग्रहले ओतप्रोत भई कार्य गर्नै पर्छ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: That the architect or predecessor should do the ostensibly.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: We should work on it with full of urges or prejudices.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation seems to have mistranslated ""त्यसमा"" (that) as ""That"" and ""आग्रह वा पूर्वाग्रहले"" (with urges or prejudices) as ""ostensibly.""
- The verb ""गर्नै पर्छ"" (should do) is translated correctly, but the structure is slightly off in the machine translation.
- The reference translation uses ""work on it"" which is a more natural and accurate way to convey the meaning of the source text.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation is missing the nuance of the original text, specifically the idea of ""urgency"" or ""prejudice"" being the driving force.
- The word order and phrasing in the machine translation are not as idiomatic as the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of capturing the full meaning and nuance of the source text, particularly in the expression of urgency or prejudice.

|Machine translation: 2031 West actively participated in various sports, cultural, religious activities under the extra activity organization.|
|Reference translation: Students were made to participate in sports, cultural, literary activities as a part of active extraordinary activities after 2031.|
|Analysis:|
1. **Time reference**: The source mentions ""२०३१ साल पश्चात"" (after 2031), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""2031 West"", which is a geographical reference and not a time reference.
2. **Active participation**: The source uses ""सक्रियतापूर्वक"" (actively), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. It is implied in the reference translation as ""as a part of active extraordinary activities.""
3. **Extra activities**: The source refers to ""अतिरिक्त क्रियाकलाप"" (extra activities), which is translated as ""under the extra activity organization"" in the machine translation. The reference translation omits the ""organization"" part and simply states ""as a part of active extraordinary activities.""
4. **Types of activities**: The source lists ""खेलकूद"" (sports), ""सांस्कृतिक"" (cultural), and ""साहित्यिक"" (literary) activities. The machine translation combines these into ""sports, cultural, religious activities,"" which is not accurate, as the source does not mention religion.

In conclusion, the machine translation has significant differences in terms of time reference, active participation, and the scope of activities, which affect the overall meaning and accuracy of the translation. The reference translation better captures the original intent of the source text.

|Analysis:|
1. The source text mentions ""कमी र सुधार गरिएको जीवनको गुणस्तरसँग सम्बन्धित"" which refers to the association with the improvement of life quality, not a lack of precipitation. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""lack of precipitation.""
2. The source text does not mention precipitation explicitly, so the reference translation omits that part, focusing only on the improved quality of life.
3. The machine translation adds the phrase ""and teotropium provides those benefits better than iapratropium"" which is not directly present in the source text. The reference translation omits this comparison, which might be inferred from the context but is not explicitly stated.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in two main aspects: it incorrectly associates teotropium with lack of precipitation and includes a comparison with iapratropium that is not explicitly stated in the source text. The reference translation accurately conveys the association with improved quality of life and the superiority of teotropium over iapratropium without the unnecessary addition of precipitation.

|Reference translation: Due to the frustration arising from the oppression, the characters in his stories have a depressing mood, inferiority, tendency to run away, loneliness, feeling of emptiness, feeling of dying, etc.|

Analysis:
1. **Difference 1**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""दमनबाट उत्पन्न"" (originating from the oppression) as ""Originating from the daman"", which is a literal translation that misses the context of oppression.
2. **Difference 2**: The machine translation translates ""निराशाजन्य मनस्थिति"" (depressing mood) as ""dishonest mind"", which is a misinterpretation. The reference translation correctly conveys the emotional state.
3. **Difference 3**: ""हीनता"" (inferiority) is translated as ""hintha"" in the machine translation, which is not a suitable equivalent. The reference translation uses ""inferiority.""
4. **Difference 4**: ""पलायनको प्रवृत्ति"" (tendency to run away) is translated as ""the proprietor of the palladium"" in the machine translation, which is a literal and unrelated interpretation. The reference translation is correct.
5. **Difference 5**: ""एकान्तपन"" (loneliness) is translated as ""antagonist"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect. The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning.
6. **Difference 6**: ""निस्सारताबोध"" (feeling of emptiness) is translated as ""nissarabodh"" in the machine translation, which is a literal and possibly incorrect term. The reference translation uses ""feeling of emptiness.""
7. **Difference 7**: ""मुमूर्षु भावना"" (mummified virgin) is translated as ""the mummified virgin"" in the machine translation, which is a literal and inappropriate interpretation. The reference translation omits this term, as it seems to be a specific or metaphorical element not found in the source.

In conclusion, the machine translation has several inaccuracies and misinterpretations, losing the context and nuances of the original Nepali text. The reference translation better captures the meaning and emotions expressed in the source.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Later in 1998, the government of Prime Minister George w. Bush removed this facility.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Later in 1998, the government of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala removed the privilege.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The source text mentions ""प्रधानमन्त्री गिरिजाप्रसाद कोइरालाको सरकार"" (Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's government), while the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""Prime Minister George w. Bush.""
- The machine translation uses ""facility"" which might be a direct translation of ""सुविधालाई"" but in this context, it seems to be a misinterpretation. The reference translation uses ""privilege,"" which is a more suitable term for the context, as the facility is being removed, not necessarily a physical facility but a benefit or right.
- The verb ""हटायो"" (removed) is translated correctly in both, but the object in the machine translation is not specific enough.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the Prime Minister's name (Girija Prasad Koirala vs. George w.

|Machine translation: The path is difficult to pedestrianize tourists as it is small and elongated.|
|Reference translation: As the road is small and difficult, it is difficult for tourists to walk.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text starts with ""बाटो सानो"" which refers to a narrow road or path. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""The path is difficult to pedestrianize,"" suggesting that the road is specifically designed for pedestrians, which is not the case in the source.
2. The source uses ""र अप्ठ्यारो भएकोले"" to describe the condition of the road, which means ""and it is narrow."" The machine translation omits this part, making the road's narrowness less clear.
3. The phrase ""पर्यटकहरूलाई पैदलयात्रा गर्न कठिन"" directly states that it is difficult for tourists to walk. The machine translation rephrases this as ""difficult to pedestrianize tourists,"" which is not a direct translation and implies a different meaning.

In conclusion, the machine translation loses the context of the road's narrowness and difficulty for tourists to walk, which are key aspects of the source text. The reference translation better captures these elements, making it a more accurate representation of the source.

- Machine translation: ""In this case, it is unnecessary to test comparisons with an overall of opinion.""
- Reference translation: ""In this case, it is unnecessary to perform a comparative test with integration of samples.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation uses ""an overall of opinion"" which is not a standard phrase in English. It seems to be a misinterpretation of ""प्रतिदर्शको समष्टिसंग"" (audience's consensus).
- The reference translation uses ""perform a comparative test with integration of samples,"" which is a more accurate representation of ""तुलनात्मक परीक्षण"" (comparative test) and ""प्रतिदर्शको समष्टिसंग"" (audience's consensus, though not directly translated as ""integration"").

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:
- It incorrectly translates ""प्रतिदर्शको समष्टिसंग"" as ""an overall of opinion"" instead of ""integration of samples.""
- The structure and phrasing of the sentence are not as clear in the machine translation as in the reference translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Identify the main ideas in the source text
- The context is about a certain concern (related to the planet) in the West.
- The concern is significant because it's the first expression of something (likely a epic or a significant event) in the West.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: Incorrectly translates ""जे भए"" (whatever) to ""Whatever has been done,"" which changes the meaning from a general reference to a specific action. It also incorrectly attributes the first expression to the planet, which is not the main focus.
- Reference translation: More accurately captures the meaning by translating ""जे भए"" as ""In any case"" and emphasizing the first expression in the West with ""because it is the first expression of the epic in the West.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation misses the nuance of the source, which is the importance of the first expression in the West, not just any action.
- The reference translation maintains the connection to the epic, which is a key part of the context.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality due to its inaccurate interpretation of the source text, specifically in the context of the first expression and the epic. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context.

- Machine translation: ""Summons people's dragon gathering to facilitate an ultimately arbitrary rule.""
- Reference translation: ""By gathering the strength of the entire people, it has decided to make a final movement and overthrow the authoritarian family rule.""

Differences:
1. ""सम्पूर्ण जनताको तागत"" (entire people's gathering) is translated as ""people's dragon gathering"" in the machine translation, which is a literal but incorrect interpretation.
2. ""एउटा अन्तिम आन्दोलन"" (final movement) is translated as ""ultimately arbitrary rule"" in the machine translation, which completely changes the meaning, as it suggests a rule is arbitrary rather than a decisive action.
3. ""स्वेच्छाचारी पारिवारिक शासनलाई"" (to overthrow the authoritarian family rule) is translated as ""facilitate an ultimately arbitrary rule"" in the machine translation, which again changes the meaning and omits the context of overthrowing.

|Source: हजुरले पहिले पनि यसरी नै आलस्य गर्नुहुन्थ्यो, हजुरलाई धन संग्रह गर्न र स्याहार्न कष्ट हुन्थ्यो, त्यसैले सबै धन नष्ट भयो।|
|Machine translation: Huzur had previously been so impressed, that he was troubled to store money and care, that all the money was destroyed.|
|Reference translation: You used to be lazy like this before, you had trouble collecting and taking care of wealth, so all the wealth was lost.|
|Analysis:|
1. **Difference in verb tense**: The source uses ""नै आलस्य गर्नुहुन्थ्यो"" (used to be lazy), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""impressed"" (which doesn't convey the past lazy behavior). The reference translation correctly uses ""used to be lazy"".
2. **Misinterpretation of ""संग्रह गर्न""**: The source means ""to collect and take care of"" wealth, but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""store money and care,"" which is not a direct match. The reference translation captures the intended meaning by using ""collecting and taking care of"".
3. **Loss of meaning in ""त्यसैले""**: The source uses ""त्यसैले"" (therefore) to connect the two actions and the consequence, but the machine translation omits this connection, making the sentence flow less smoothly. The reference translation includes this connection with ""so"".
4. **Incorrect translation of ""नष्ट भयो""**: The source means ""was lost with fear"" (implying a sense of loss and concern), but the machine translation simply says ""was destroyed,"" which doesn't convey the fear or concern. The reference translation captures this by saying ""all the wealth was lost.""

Overall, the machine translation loses crucial nuances and meaning, while the reference translation better captures the original intent and structure of the Nepali sentence.|

|Source: सामवेदका अधिकांश मन्त्रहरू ऋग्वेदबाट नै लिएका छन् ।|
|Machine translation: The majority of Samweed's ministers are from negotiations.|
|Reference translation: The majority of spellings in Samveda are taken from Rigveda.|

|Analysis|
1. **Word-by-word comparison**: The source text mentions ""सामवेदका"" (Samveda's), which refers to a text, not ""Samweed"" as in the machine translation. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""सामवेदका"" as ""ministers"" (मन्त्रहरू) and ""लिएका"" (taken) as ""are from negotiations"" (are from).
2. **Contextual difference**: The source text is discussing the origin of words or verses in the Samveda, not the ministers. The reference translation correctly captures this by saying ""spellings"" (लिएका) and ""Rigveda"" (ऋग्वेदबाट), which refers to the ancient Hindu scripture.
3. **Grammar and structure**: The machine translation has incorrect grammar, as it incorrectly combines ""ministers"" with ""negotiations"" and omits the connection to the Rigveda.

In conclusion, the machine translation is significantly different from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, context, and grammar. The correct translation should be: ""The majority of spellings in Samveda are taken from Rigveda.""

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: तीमध्ये १५ सयदेखि २ हजार व्यक्तिलाई विषालु सर्पले टोक्ने गर्छ ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Those 15 hundred to 2 thousand persons with poisonous serpent token.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Poisonous snakes bite about 15 hundred to 2 thousand persons, among them.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""Those 15 hundred to 2 thousand persons with poisonous serpent token,"" which suggests that the people possess a token related to poisonous snakes.
- The reference translation, on the other hand, says ""Poisonous snakes bite about 15 hundred to 2 thousand persons, among them,"" which implies that the snakes are the ones causing harm to a group of people, not that the people have tokens.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The main difference is the interpretation of the subject and action. The machine translation incorrectly attributes the possession of a token to the people, while the reference translation correctly states that the snakes are the ones biting the people.
- The reference translation also includes the phrase ""among them,"" which is not present in the machine translation, but it adds context to the source text by indicating that the number of people affected is within the range mentioned.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the subject and the action. It incorrectly translates the source text to imply that people have tokens related to snakes, whereas the reference translation correctly conveys that snakes are biting a group of people, with the numbers provided. The reference translation also includes additional context with the phrase ""among them.""

Step 1: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- ""यसैले"" (Therefore)
- ""पूर्वीय महाकाव्यको"" (Eastern epic)
- ""समयलाई"" (of the time)
- ""ह्रासोन्मुख कालका"" (depreciation/declining period)
- ""रूपमा"" (in the form of)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""Therefore this time of the eastern plain has been recognized as a depreciation.""
- Reference translation: ""This is why this period of the Eastern epic is known as the declining period.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation uses ""eastern plain"" instead of ""Eastern epic,"" which is a significant difference as it changes the subject from a cultural or literary context to a geographical one.
- The machine translation uses ""recognized as a depreciation"" instead of ""known as the declining period,"" which alters the meaning, suggesting a more formal or economic recognition, whereas the reference translation implies a more historical or cultural understanding.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of subject matter (Eastern epic vs. eastern plain) and the connotation of the phrase (depreciation vs. declining period), which affects the overall meaning and context of the sentence. The reference translation better captures the cultural and historical significance of the phrase in the original Nepali text.

Machine translation: Received extracts are tested which are called to test alternatives.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The obtained results are tested which is called hypothesis testing.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the source text

- ""जसलाई प्राक्कल्पना परीक्षण गर्नु भनिन्छ"" means ""which are called hypothesis testing.""

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation correctly translates ""received extracts"" as ""received results"" but uses ""test alternatives"" instead of ""hypothesis testing.""
- The reference translation specifically mentions ""hypothesis testing,"" which is a standard term in the context of statistical analysis.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the phrase ""test alternatives,"" which is not an accurate translation of ""प्राक्कल्पना परीक्षण"" (hypothesis testing). The reference translation is more precise and contextually appropriate.

|Reference translation: There was no food at home due to poverty, but Hitan borrowed money from a bookstore to read.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference in sentence structure**: The machine translation has a repetitive structure, which is not present in the reference translation. The reference sentence flows more naturally with a single mention of ""the poor in the house"" and the action of borrowing money.

2. **Missing context**: The machine translation does not convey the reason for the action, which is the lack of food at home in the source text. The reference translation includes this information.

3. **Incorrect verb tense**: The machine translation does not specify that Hitan borrowed money in the past, as indicated by the past tense verb ""गरेर"" (borrowed) in the source text. The reference translation uses the past tense correctly.

4. **Omission of Hitan's name**: The machine translation omits Hitan's name, which is present in the source text.

5. **Incorrect word order**: The phrase ""पनि पुस्तक पसलबाट पत्रपत्रिका ल्याएर"" (to read magazines from a bookstore) is not translated accurately. The reference translation rephrases it as ""to read from a bookstore.""

Overall, the machine translation is significantly different from the reference translation in terms of structure, context, and word choice, leading to a less accurate representation of the source text.

|Reference translation: It is seen that Jatak harrashes in relation problem with his family and especially with his brother and sisters.|

Analysis:
1. The source text talks about ""जातकले"" (Jatak's) situation regarding family and specific issues with his brother and sisters, using the term ""सम्बद्ध समस्याले"" (related problems).
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""सताउने देखनिछ"" (seen that) as ""is shown to have survived"", which is a misinterpretation of the context. The focus is on observing the problems, not survival.
3. The machine translation omits the term ""खासगरी"" (especially) which emphasizes the significance of the relationship issues with his brother and sisters.
4. The reference translation captures the meaning more accurately by translating ""सताउने देखनिछ"" as ""It is seen"" and including the term ""हरास्थ"" (harrashes) to convey the problem.

Overall, the machine translation is not accurate in capturing the nuances of the source text, particularly the context of problems and the emphasis on the relationship with siblings. The reference translation is a better representation of the original meaning.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Of course, both rahu and ketu are extremely deeply involved with our workmanship of the planet.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In fact, both Rahu and Ketu have a very deep connection with our karmic fruit.

Step 4: Compare the differences
1. ""वास्तवमा"" (In fact) vs ""Of course"" - The machine translation uses ""Of course"" which is a more colloquial expression, while the reference uses ""In fact"" which is more formal and closer to the original meaning.
2. ""राहु र केतु"" (Rahu and Ketu) - Both translations correctly identify the astrological terms, but the machine translation does not capitalize them, which is a minor detail.
3. ""दुबै ग्रहको"" (both planets') - The machine translation omits the word ""दुबै"" (both), which is important to convey the involvement of both celestial bodies.
4. ""हाम्रो कर्मगत फलसँग"" (our karmic fruit) vs ""workmanship of the planet"" - The machine translation uses ""workmanship"" which is not a direct translation of ""कर्मगत फलसँग"" (karmic fruit). The reference translation captures the essence of the karmic aspect more accurately.
5. ""अति गहिरो सम्बन्ध"" (extremely deep connection) vs ""extremely deeply involved"" - The machine translation uses ""extremely deeply involved"" which is a rephrasing, but the original Nepali phrase emphasizes the depth of the connection, which is not as clearly conveyed in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some differences in terms of tone, word choice, and the specific meaning of ""workmanship"" vs ""karmic fruit."" It loses some nuance and accuracy compared to the reference translation.

|Source: गृह, परराष्ट्र, रक्षा, अर्थ, लोकसेवा आयोग, राजदरबार र सिंहदरबारबारे रायसल्लाह दिने विज्ञको भेषमा गोविन्दनारायण सिंहलाई नेपाल पठाइयो।|
|Machine translation: Govindanarayan Singh was sent to Nepal in the faculty of sciences to give rayasallah about home, tradition, safety, meaning, popular community, palace and learning.|
|Reference translation: Govind Singh was sent in the form the specialist to give advice about Home, Foreign, Defence, Public service commission, Royal Palace, and Singhdurbar.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""रायसल्लाह"" (rayasallah), which is a term that does not have a direct translation in English. It seems to be a reference to a specific topic or event, possibly related to advice or consultation. The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""about home, tradition, safety, meaning, popular community,"" which is a broader interpretation and does not capture the original context.

2. The machine translation mentions ""faculty of sciences,"" which is not present in the source text. The reference translation omits this detail, which might be an assumption or a simplification.

3. The reference translation uses ""the specialist"" to describe the role of Govindanarayan Singh, which is not directly translated from ""भेषमा"" (bheshma) in the source text. The machine translation does not provide this context.

4. The source text includes ""राजदरबार"" (rajdarbar) and ""सिंहदरबार"" (singhdurbar), which are both Nepali terms for the Royal Palace and Singhdurbar, respectively. The machine translation combines them into ""palace and learning,"" which is not accurate.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of the specific topic (rayasallah), the role description (specialist), and the accurate representation of the Nepali terms for palace and the two distinct locations. The machine translation is broader and less precise than the reference translation.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Suddenly , mortars , shells , and large fire power were suddenly attacked from four directions .

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""एक्कासि"" (suddenly) which is not captured in the machine translation, which uses ""Throughout the ace"" which is a misinterpretation.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""मोर्टार, सेल"" (mortar, shell) as ""the scarp"" and ""ठूला फायरपावर"" (large firepower) as ""spoken from"", which is not accurate.
- The reference translation correctly conveys the action of ""attack"" (धावा बोलियो) as ""were suddenly attacked"" and the direction ""चारैतिर"" (four directions) as ""from four directions"".

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation captures the suddenness of the event, the types of weapons (mortars, shells), and the direction of the attack, which are all missing or incorrectly translated in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the timing (suddenly vs. throughout the ace), the action (attack vs. spoken), and the context (directions).

|Analysis|
1. **""राज्यसत्ताबाट पिछडिएका वर्गलाई पूर्ण अधिकार प्रदान""** (from statehood to the backward classes) - Machine translation: ""from statehood to the drifting square""

2. **""नेपालको सर्वाङ्गिण विकास""** (all-round development of Nepal) - Machine translation: ""Nepal's serwangi development""
   - Error: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""सर्वाङ्गिण"" (all-round) as ""serwangi"", which is a confusion or mistranslation of the term.

3. **""हुन नसक्ने"" (would not be possible)** - Machine translation: ""could not be able to""

|Reference translation: At the 2013 Slammy Awards, Triple H hit Randy Orton with Pedigree when Brian pushed Orton over Stephanie McMahon.|

Analysis:
1. **Timeframe**: The machine translation incorrectly uses ""paired"" (पाईद) instead of ""hit"" (हान) for the action of Triple H, which changes the meaning from a physical attack to a teaming up in a wrestling context.
2. **Action**: The machine translation uses ""peddie"" (पेडिडी), which is likely a typo or incorrect word, whereas the reference translation uses ""Pedigree"" (पेडिग्री), which is a wrestling move.
3. **Event**: The machine translation mentions ""braun had paired up Orton to Stephinie Mcmain,"" which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly states that Brian pushed Orton over Stephanie McMahon, indicating a different action by Brian.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the action (attack vs. pairing), the specific wrestling move (Pedigree), and the event description (pushing vs. pairing). The machine translation is not an accurate representation of the source text.

Machine translation: Because it is easy to say that the basis of tradition with the east is Samweed.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: For this reason, it can easily be said that the basis of tradition of eastern music is Saamved.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""with the east"" instead of ""eastern music"" in the context, which is a misinterpretation of the source.
- ""सामवेद"" in the source is translated as ""Samweed"" in the machine translation, which is a direct word-for-word translation that doesn't convey the meaning of the original word, which refers to a collection of sacred texts in Hinduism and Vedic tradition.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""पूर्वी संगित परम्पराको आधार"" as ""basis of tradition of eastern music"" and uses ""it can easily be said"" instead of a direct translation, making the sentence more natural in English.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity (mentioning ""eastern music"" instead of ""with the east"") and cultural context (translating ""सामवेद"" as ""Samweed"" instead of its meaning in the context of Hindu/Vedic tradition).

|Machine translation: Jayabharathi, who assumed that reading should be a scholar.|
|Reference translation: Jaya Bahadur believed that one should be a scholar by studying.|

|Analysis|
1. The source sentence in Nepali discusses the idea that Jayabharathu holds the view that being a reader (पढेर) should be considered a form of scholarship (विद्वान हुनुपर्छ).
2. In the machine translation, the subject ""Jayabharathi"" is incorrectly translated as a possessive phrase, suggesting that Jayabharathi is the one who assumes reading to be a scholar, which is not the intended meaning. The correct interpretation is that Jayabharathu is the one with the belief.
3. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning by stating that Jayabharathu believed (मान्यता राख्थे) that one should become a scholar (विद्वान) through the process of studying (by studying, अध्ययन गर्ने).

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it incorrectly attributes the belief to Jayabharathi as if it's something she possesses, rather than stating that Jayabharathu holds the belief that studying makes one a scholar.

|Source: यो योग हुने व्यक्तिले ४८ वर्षको उमेरमा बृहस्पतिग्रहको उत्तम फल प्राप्त गर्दछ।|
|Machine translation: People who have this sum receive the best fruits of Jupiter at the age of 48.|
|Reference translation: People who have this luck receive the best fruits of Jupiter at the age of 48.|

**Analysis:**

1. **""यो योग हुने""** (This is the yoga) - Machine translation: ""People who have this sum"" - The machine translation omits the context of ""yoga"" which refers to a specific quality or fortunate state, not just a sum of money. The reference translation uses ""luck"" to convey the same meaning.
2. **""व्यक्तिले""** (people) - Both translations correctly use ""people.""
3. **""४८ वर्षको""** (at the age of 48) - Both translations retain this age reference.
4. **""उमेरमा""** (in their lifetime) - The machine translation does not include this part, which is implied in the source text as the age at which the event occurs. The reference translation does not directly translate this phrase but implies it with ""at the age of.""
5. **""बृहस्पतिग्रहको""** (of Jupiter) - Both translations correctly include this.
6. **""उत्तम फल प्राप्त गर्दछ""** (receive the best fruits) - Machine translation: ""receive the best fruits"" - The machine translation is accurate here, but the reference translation adds ""of Jupiter"" after ""best fruits"" to clarify the context.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- It omits the context of ""yoga"" and uses ""sum"" instead, which might lead to confusion.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: त्यसैले लाेकगीत भनेकाे समष्टिकाे मनबाट जन्मिने कुरा हाे ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: So lake music came to be born out of the mind of Samstha.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: That is why folk songs are born from the heart of the community.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation mentions ""lake music"" which is not present in the source text. The source text refers to ""लाेकगीत"" (folk songs), not specifically lake music.
- The machine translation translates ""मनबाट"" (from the mind) as ""mind of Samstha,"" which is a literal interpretation and does not convey the intended meaning of the source, which refers to the collective or community's heart.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""समष्टिकाे"" (community) and conveys the idea that folk songs come from the heart of the community, which is a more accurate representation of the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity (湖边音乐 vs. 民歌) and the metaphorical expression (mind of Samstha vs. community's heart). The reference translation better captures the essence of the source text.

|Source: मानव जन्ममा गरिएको साधना तथा भक्ति अनुसार जिव माथिका देवलोकहरूमा जान्छ र आफ्नो पूण्य समाप्त भए पछि पुनः यस संसारमा संस्कारवश जन्म लिन्छ ।|
|Machine translation: According to the causes and devotions done to human birth, living goes to cedarlokes above and rebirths into this world after finishing his pleasure.|
|Reference translation: According to the sadhana and devotion done in human birth, the living being goes to the higher worlds and after the end of his Punya, he is reborn in this world according to the rites.|

Analysis:
1. **Sādhanā (sadana)**: The machine translation uses ""causes and devotions"" which is a direct translation of ""causes and devotions"" but misses the specific term ""sādhanā"" from the source, which refers to spiritual practices or rituals.
2. **Cedarlokes (cedarlokes)**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""माथिका देवलोकहरू"" as ""cedarlokes."" The reference translation refers to ""higher worlds"" or ""माथिका देवलोक"" which is a more accurate interpretation.
3. **Pleasure (पूण्य)**: The machine translation uses ""finishing his pleasure"" while the reference translation uses ""after the end of his Punya."" ""Punya"" is a concept in Hinduism related to good deeds and merits, not just pleasure.
4. **Rites (संस्कार)**: The machine translation omits this term, which is crucial in the context of rebirth according to specific customs or rituals.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specific religious concepts (sādhanā, Punya, and संस्कार), and the translation of ""माथिका देवलोकहरू"" to ""cedarlokes"" is inaccurate. The reference translation provides a more faithful and culturally appropriate translation.

|im_start|
The machine translation and the reference translation are mostly identical, with only a minor difference in punctuation. The source text ends with a period (।), which is a common punctuation mark in Nepali, while the machine and reference translations both use a comma (,) after the clause. This difference in punctuation does not significantly alter the meaning, but it is a deviation from the Nepali original.

The main content of the sentence, which discusses Rahu and ketu being called shadow planets due to the lack of physical mass in the sky, is accurately translated in both versions. The machine translation captures the essence of the source text, and the reference translation is a faithful representation as well.

In summary, the main issue with the machine translation is the difference in punctuation, but the core meaning remains the same. The quality of the translation can be considered good, given that the essential information is accurately conveyed.

|Source: यहा हालै मात्रै समुदायको पहलमा निकै राम्रो अस्पताल निर्माण भएको छ भने शिक्षा लागि क्याम्पस तथा विद्यालयहरू पनि लेखनाथमा रहेका छन ।|
|Machine translation: Jaha has recently built a very good hospital in the palace of the community, also writing campuses and schools for education.|
|Reference translation: A very good hospital has been built here recently at the initiative of the community and there are also campuses and schools for education in Lekhnath.|

|Analysis|
1. **""यहा हालै""** (Here recently) vs. **""Jaha has recently""**: The machine translation incorrectly places the location ""here"" in the beginning, while the reference translation correctly uses ""here recently"" to indicate the recent occurrence.
2. **""समुदायको पहलमा""** (at the initiative of the community) vs. **""in the palace of the community""**: The machine translation incorrectly translates this phrase to imply the hospital is in the palace, while the reference translation correctly conveys the community's initiative.
3. **""निकै""** (nearly) vs. **""built""**: The machine translation omits the word ""nearly"" or ""approximately"" from the source, which might affect the meaning slightly, as the source suggests the hospital is almost or recently constructed.
4. **""लेखनाथमा""** (in Lekhnath) vs. **""writing""**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""लेखनाथमा"" as ""writing,"" which is a verb, while the reference translation places it as a location, indicating that the campuses and schools are in Lekhnath.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of location, the community's initiative, and the verb ""writing"" being incorrectly translated as a location. The overall meaning and context are not accurately conveyed by the machine translation.

|Source: हनुमानको दृढ शरीरमा जब कुनै प्रभाव परेन तब शनिले हनुमानको सामु हात जोडेर वरदान माग्न अनुरोध गरे।|
|Machine translation: When there was no influence on Hanuman's body, Saturn requested that Saturn join his hands before Hanuman, and ask for the gift.|
|Reference translation: When there was no effect on Hanuman 's strong body , Shani joined hands with Hanuman and asked for a blessing.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Subject identification**: In the source, ""शनिले"" (Shani) is the subject performing the action, while the machine translation incorrectly attributes the action to ""Saturn requested that Saturn"" (which is redundant and confusing).
2. **Action description**: The source mentions ""जब कुनै प्रभाव परेन"" (when there was no influence), which is translated as ""there was no influence on Hanuman's body"" in the machine translation. This is accurate.
3. **Action description (continued)**: The source then describes Shani's action of ""हनुमानको सामु हात जोडेर"" (joining hands with Hanuman), which is translated as ""join his hands before Hanuman"" in the machine translation. The meaning is similar but not as clear as the reference translation, which uses ""joined hands with Hanuman.""
4. **Request**: The source uses ""वरदान माग्न अनुरोध गरे"" (asked for a great gift), which is translated as ""ask for the gift"" in the machine translation. The reference translation simplifies this to ""asked for a blessing,"" which is a more natural and accurate expression in English.

In summary, the machine translation has issues with subject clarity and the specific action description, while the reference translation provides a clearer and more natural English equivalent. The main differences lie in the subject and the way the action is described.|im_end|

|Reference translation: Or if the research problem cannot be resolved, the observation and review of the literature helps to concentrate the attention.|

|Analysis|
1. **""शोध समस्याबारे""** (about research problem) vs. **""suspension problem""**: The machine translation incorrectly translates the context of the issue as a suspension problem, while the reference translation correctly refers to a research problem.
2. **""साहित्यको""** (literary) vs. **""the course""**: The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the course,"" which is not relevant to the context of discussing literature. The reference translation uses ""literature"" (साहित्य) which is more accurate.
3. **""अवलोकन र पुनरावलोकन""** (observation and review) vs. **""observation and review of the course""**: The machine translation omits the connection to literature and instead refers to a course, which is not consistent with the source text.
4. **""ध्यान केन्द्रित गर्न""** (to focus) vs. **""focus attention""**: Both translations convey a similar meaning, but the reference translation uses ""concentrate the attention"" which is a more natural phrasing in English.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of the context (research problem vs. suspension), specificity (literature vs. course), and the overall structure of the sentence.

|Reference translation: Upon hearing such news from their father, sons Vijay and Ajay from Hong Kong and son Sanjay from Australia came to Nepal immediately.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject**: The source mentions ""विजय र अजय छोरा"" (Vijay and Ajay) and ""सञ्जय छोरा"" (Sanjay) as the individuals coming to Nepal. The machine translation incorrectly translates these as ""the victims"" and ""the sons of Ajay"", which are not the same.
2. **Action**: The source uses ""सुनेर तुरुन्त"" (immediately upon hearing) to describe the action of the individuals coming to Nepal. The machine translation omits this context, making it unclear when Nepal heard the news.
3. **Relationship**: The source specifies that the individuals are the sons of their father, who is not mentioned in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly includes this familial relationship.
4. **Destination**: The source mentions ""हङकङमा"" (Hong Kong), ""अस्ट्रेलियामा"" (Australia), and ""नेपाल"" (Nepal) as the locations. The machine translation incorrectly combines these locations, suggesting Nepal heard about the individuals from these places, rather than them coming to Nepal.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the individuals' identities, the context of their action, and the relationship between them and their father. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the original Nepali sentence.

|Analysis|
1. **Subject matter**: The source text mentions ""धर्म, दर्शन, विज्ञान"" which translates to ""religion, philosophy, and science"" in the reference translation. The machine translation incorrectly translates these as ""threats, visions, sciences,"" which are not the same subjects.
2. **Adjectives**: The source text uses ""गम्भीर"" (serious) to describe the topics, but the machine translation does not include this adjective, making the meaning less clear.

|Reference translation: Subedi , Rajendra , Sampa , Snatakottar Nepali Nibandha , Kathmandu : Pathyasamagri Pasal , 2050.|

Analysis:

1. **Names**: In the source, the names are ""सुवेदी"" and ""राजेन्द्र"", which are likely to be proper nouns (specific individuals). The machine translation incorrectly translates these as ""Sweedi"" and ""Raj"", which are likely errors in transliteration or misinterpretation.

2. **Book title**: The source mentions ""स्नातकोत्तर नेपाली निबन्ध"" which refers to a ""Bachelor's level Nepali essay"" or book. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Sanatan Nepali Banquet"", which is a completely different concept.

3. **Publisher**: The source lists ""पाठ्यसामग्री पसल"" as the publisher, which is likely a publisher of educational materials. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Textiles Publishers"", which is unrelated to the context.

4. **No change in other elements**: The city ""काठमाडौं"" (Kathmandu) and the year ""२०५०"" remain the same in both translations.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of proper names, book title, and publisher, while retaining some elements correctly. The quality of the translation is low due to these inaccuracies.

Step 2: Read the machine translation

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The Asyrians are believed to have given some contributions in the field of literature science.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the source text, ""साहित्य विज्ञानको"" refers to ""literature science"" or the study of literature, not ""religious sciences.""
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""देन दिएको"" (given) as ""consider some deity,"" which is not the intended meaning. The correct interpretation is that the Asyrians are believed to have made contributions.
- The reference translation captures the idea of contributions in the field of literature, which is more accurate than the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it incorrectly translates the field of study and the meaning of the verb ""देन दिएको.""

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: SN of section of the organisation / proposed by SSN for unification or division

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the source text, ""सङ्गठन फांटका"" refers to ""section of the organization"" or ""SN of section"" (abbreviation for संगठन स्थानांक, SN), which is not directly translated as ""Organization Fatca"" in the machine translation. The machine translation seems to have interpreted ""फांटका"" as a separate term, which is incorrect.
- The machine translation states ""regulations of integration or separation,"" while the reference translation uses ""proposed by SSN for unification or division."" The reference translation is more accurate in conveying the purpose of the proposal, which is to propose rules for unification or division, rather than just stating the regulations.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation has differences in terms of the interpretation of ""सङ्गठन फांटका"" and the context of the proposal. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text, specifically by identifying ""SN of section"" and emphasizing the purpose of the proposal. The machine translation could be improved by recognizing ""सङ्गठन फांटका"" as an abbreviation and conveying the intent of the proposal more clearly.

|Source: हास्यतत्व र व्यङ्ग्यतत्व दुवैको सन्तुलित संयोजन भएन भने यस्ता निबन्ध प्रभावकारी हुँदैन्।|
|Machine translation: Since there is no satisfactory combination of both mysteries and contradictions, such bantering is not effective.|
|Reference translation: Without a balanced combination of humor and satire, such essays would not be effective.|

Analysis:

1. **Humor and humor**: The source text uses ""हास्यतत्व"" (humor) and ""व्यङ्ग्यतत्व"" (satire) in the context of a balanced combination. The machine translation translates ""हास्यतत्व"" as ""mysteries"" and ""व्यङ्ग्यतत्व"" as ""contradictions"", which are not accurate. The reference translation correctly uses ""humor"" and ""satire"".

2. **Satisfaction and balance**: The source text uses ""सन्तुलित संयोजन"" (balanced combination), which implies a sense of adequacy or appropriateness. The machine translation translates this as ""no satisfactory combination"", which is a similar concept but not an exact match. The reference translation uses ""balanced combination"", which is more precise.

3. **Effectiveness**: Both the source and the reference translation convey the idea that the absence of the mentioned balance makes the essays less effective. The machine translation states ""such bantering is not effective"", which is a close approximation but could be more specific to bantering in the source context. The reference translation generalizes it to ""such essays would not be effective"", which is a broader statement that still captures the essence.

In conclusion, the machine translation loses some accuracy in terms of specific terms (humor vs. mysteries, satire vs. contradictions) and slightly alters the meaning by generalizing the effectiveness. The reference translation provides a more faithful and nuanced translation.

|Analysis|
1. **Vedic history vs alien history**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""वैदिक इतिहास"" (Vedic history) as ""alien history"", which is a significant difference, as it changes the cultural and religious context.
2. **ऋग्वेदको ज्ञान** (the knowledge of the Rig Veda) vs **negotiation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""ऋग्वेदको ज्ञान"" as ""the knowledge of negotiation"", which is a mistranslation, as it refers to the Rig Veda, an ancient Hindu scripture, not negotiation.
3. **अग्नि देवताको मुखबाट** (from the mouth of the god Agni) vs **the mouth of the god Agnes**: The name of the deity is mistranslated as ""Agnes"" instead of ""Agni"", which is a crucial difference, as Agni is a prominent Vedic deity associated with fire and knowledge.

2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""वैवाहिक हैसियत"" as ""alternative hunting"", which is a misinterpretation of the context. The correct meaning should be ""marital status.""
3. The machine translation also incorrectly translates ""हित"" as ""hunting"" and ""हैसियतमा असर"" as ""hunting and hunting,"" which are not accurate translations. ""हित"" refers to interests or well-being, and ""हैसियतमा असर"" refers to the impact on status, not a separate activity.
4. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of the source text, focusing on ""marital status"" and its effects on children's interests and status.

1. **Source**: The source text discusses the usage of the names ""Gautam"" and ""Buddha"" in the context of the Gautam Gotra, a lineage, and mentions the approximate time frame of 2500 years before Gautam Buddha's birth.
2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""गौतम गोत्रमा"" (Gautam Gotra) as ""gothic goths,"" which is a misinterpretation of the term. It also incorrectly suggests that the usage of the words is about the birth rather than the starting point of the lineage.
3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation correctly identifies the context as the ""Gautam Gotra"" and accurately conveys the time frame as ""about 2500 years before the birth of Gautam Buddha.""

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its incorrect interpretation of ""Gautam Gotra"" as ""gothic goths"" and its misunderstanding of the time frame and focus of the sentence. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning and context of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Understand the source text
The source text is in Nepali and says, ""यस भावमा बसेर राहुले सदैव जातकलाई दहीचिउरे स्वभावको बनाइदिन्छ।"" This sentence can be translated to English as, ""By sitting in this place, Rahu creates the nature of Dahichiure in the person forever.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation provided is, ""Sitting in this vowel, Rahu makes a perpetual journey."" This translation is not accurate because it incorrectly translates ""भावमा बसेर"" (in this place) to ""vowel"" and changes the meaning to a journey instead of creating a nature.

Step 3: Compare the reference translation
The reference translation is, ""By sitting in this place, Rahu always makes the native of Dahichiure nature."" This translation captures the essence of the source text, maintaining the meaning that Rahu's influence creates a specific nature associated with Dahichiure.

Step 4: Identify differences
The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are:
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""भावमा बसेर"" as ""vowel"" instead of ""in this place.""
- The machine translation describes Rahu's action as a ""perpetual journey,"" which is not the intended meaning in the source text.
- The reference translation accurately conveys the creation of ""nature"" by Rahu, while the machine translation omits this aspect.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of accuracy and meaning. The reference translation better captures the essence of the source text by conveying the idea of Rahu's influence on the native's nature of Dahichiure.

|Source: उनी जनचेतनाका संवाहक र गरिव, दुःखीका पहरेदार भएर जीवन समर्पण गरेका एक जागरुक योद्धा हुन्।|
|Machine translation: He is a magistrate who has dedicated life to the marriage and poverty of Jane, sorrowful parents.|
|Reference translation: He is a carrier of public consciousness and a empowered warrior who has dedicated his life as a guardian of the poor and miserable.|

|Analysis|
1. **""जनचेतनाका संवाहक""** (carrier of public consciousness) - Machine translation: ""marriage and poverty of Jane"" (misinterprets the context, assuming Jane is the focus)
2. **""गरिव""** (poor) - Machine translation: ""sorrowful parents"" (incorrectly translates the term to describe a state, not poverty)
3. **""दुःखीका पहरेदार""** (sorrowful guardian) - Machine translation: ""sorrowful parents"" (confuses the role as a guardian with the emotional state)
4. **""जीवन समर्पण""** (dedication of life) - Machine translation: ""dedicated life"" (repeated, lacks the nuance of the reference translation)
5. **""एक जागरुक योद्धा""** (an awakened warrior) - Machine translation: Not present, missing the description of the warrior's awareness.

The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the source text, particularly in the roles and context. It incorrectly translates ""गरिव"" as ""sorrowful parents"" and misses the concept of ""public consciousness"" and the warrior's dedication to the poor and miserable. The reference translation provides a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the original Nepali text.

|Source: मार्च १९९६मा शकीरा ""टूर पीएस देस्काल्जोस"" नामको आफ्नो पहिलो अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय यात्रामा निस्किईन।|
|Machine translation: In March 1996, Shakira went out on her first international journey under the name ""TUR PS Duscaljos"".|
|Reference translation: In March 1996, Shakira embarked on her first international tour, the ""Tour Pies Descalzos"".|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""मार्च १९९६मा"" (March 1996) which is correctly translated as ""In March 1996"" in both the machine and reference translations.
2. The source text refers to ""शकीरा"" (Shakira) as the subject, which is correctly translated in both.
3. The main difference lies in the translation of the tour name. The source text has ""टूर पीएस देस्काल्जोस"" (Tour Pies Descalzos), which is split into two parts in the machine translation: ""TUR PS Duscaljos"". The reference translation correctly combines the words as ""the 'Tour Pies Descalzos'"".
4. The verb ""निस्किईन"" (went out) in the source is translated to ""went out"" in the machine translation, which is accurate. However, the reference translation uses ""embarked on"" which is a more appropriate term for a tour context.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the way it splits the tour name ""Tour Pies Descalzos"" and omits the quotation marks around it. The reference translation also uses a more idiomatic term ""embarked on"" for the tour.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: After a lemmy talks, a little girl's house is taken away.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: After Lamy finalizes the matter, it is the tradition to take Sagun from Boy's side to Girl's home.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""लमीले कुरा छिनेपछि"" (After Lamy finalizes), which is not accurately translated as ""a lemmy talks"" in the machine translation. The word ""कुरा छिनेपछि"" refers to the completion or finalization of a discussion or matter, not a person named ""lemmy"" talking.
- The machine translation omits the context of a tradition and the specific action of taking Sagun from one side to the other, which is present in the reference translation.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly captures the meaning that after a discussion or matter is finalized by Lamy, it is a tradition to take Sagun from the boy's side to the girl's home.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the context and the specific cultural reference. The machine translation loses the meaning of a tradition and the proper interpretation of the source text.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: त्यसैकारण निङमापाका अनुयायीलाई रातो टोपी सम्प्रदाय र ग्यालोक्पाका अनुयायीलाई पहेँलो टोपी सम्प्रदाय भन्ने नामकरण गरिएको पनि पाइन्छ ।
Machine translation: It is therefore also found that ningmapa's followers are red toothed and galocpa's followers are named yellow toothed respectively.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- The machine translation has ""red toothed"" and ""yellow toothed"" which are not directly translated from the source text. The source text uses ""रातो टोपी सम्प्रदाय"" (night cap community) and ""पहेँलो टोपी सम्प्रदाय"" (top hat community) to describe the followers of Ningmapa and Galocpa.
- The word order is changed in the machine translation, which affects the meaning of the phrase.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Therefore , it is also found that Ningmapa 's followers are named as Red-caped Community and Galocpa 's followers are named Yellow-caped respectively .

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text by translating ""रातो टोपी सम्प्रदाय"" as ""Red-caped Community"" and ""पहेँलो टोपी सम्प्रदाय"" as ""Yellow-caped"".
- The structure of the sentence is closer to the source text in the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific names for the follower communities (night cap vs. red-capped, top hat vs. yellow-capped) and the word order, which results in a less accurate representation of the original Nepali text. The reference translation better captures the intended meaning and cultural context.

|Reference translation: Therefore, the gotra, branch, pravar, and sutra of the Tripathis are different.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""त्रिपाठीहरूको"" (Tripathis' or referring to a group with the surname Tripathi), which is a possessive form in Nepali. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the goat of the triplets,"" which is a literal and unrelated interpretation.
2. The machine translation repeats the word ""branch"" multiple times, likely due to a lack of understanding or context. In the reference translation, it is only mentioned once as ""branch"" followed by ""pravar"" and ""sutra,"" which are additional terms related to genealogy or family divisions.
3. The reference translation includes ""pravar"" and ""sutra,"" which are not present in the machine translation. These terms are crucial for accurately conveying the meaning of the source text, as they refer to specific aspects of the family system.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of context, accuracy, and the inclusion of important terms specific to Nepali-English genealogical terminology. The machine translation should be revised to reflect the intended meaning, which is the difference in gotra, branch, pravar, and sutra among the Tripathi family.

|Reference translation: The fact that the Sama Veda is the foundation of songs and music is prevalent among the scholars who have knowledge of the Vedas.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text discusses the connection between the Sāma Veda and the foundation of songs and music, not the altar.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""सामवेद"" (Sāma Veda) as ""altar"" (which is ""पुजाले"" in Nepali), which is a misunderstanding of the context.
3. The machine translation states ""It is adapted to scholars,"" which is not present in the source text. The source implies that the knowledge is prevalent among scholars, not that it is specifically adapted to them.
4. The reference translation correctly identifies the Sāma Veda as the foundation and specifies that it is prevalent among scholars knowledgeable in the Vedas.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its incorrect interpretation of the Sāma Veda as an altar, the adaptation to scholars, and the lack of emphasis on the prevalence among Vedācarya (scholars of the Vedas).

Analysis:
1. The source text is about the existence of Rudras in relation to the development of the Hanuman sect (सम्प्रदाय).

|Analysis:|
1. **""डब्ल्युडब्ल्युई च्याम्पियनसिपको खेललाई भने""** (Machine: ""The WWE Championship game was made"") - The machine translation uses ""made"" which implies a creation or production, while the reference uses ""created"" which is more accurate in this context, as it refers to the act of bringing something into existence.
2. **""रमा कार्यरत सामान्य प्रबन्धकको रूपमा सेवा""** (Machine: ""acting general manager at rma"") - The machine translation incorrectly mentions ""acting general manager at rma"" instead of ""Raw"", which is the actual wrestling brand where Vicky Guerrero served as general manager. The reference translation correctly specifies ""Raw.""
3. **""दिइरहेकी भिकि गुरेरोले""** (Machine: ""who served"") - The machine translation omits the word ""भिकि"" (which means ""by"" in Nepali) and the name ""गुरेरोले"" (Vickie Guerrero), making the sentence less clear.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: That it is known that this styles are of early condition.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: From that , it is known that this rock carving is of early stage.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""शैलबुट्टा"" (rock carving), which is not translated accurately as ""styles"" in the machine translation.
- The machine translation omits the context ""त्यसबाट"" (from that), which is important for understanding the source's meaning.
- The machine translation uses ""condition"" instead of ""stage"" in the reference translation, which changes the meaning slightly.

|Machine translation: This university also currently carries a burden of more than 75 percent on Nepal's higher education.|
|Reference translation: This university still carries a burden of more than 75 percent on Nepal 's higher education.|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation adds the word ""also"" which is not present in the source text. This implies that the source does not specify that the university's burden is in addition to other universities, but the reference translation suggests it.
2. The machine translation uses ""currently"" which is not directly translated from the source. The source text does not explicitly mention a time frame, so it's not clear if ""हाल"" (recently or currently) is implied or not. The reference translation omits this word, which might be a more accurate interpretation.
3. The machine translation has a space after ""Nepal's"", which is not present in the source or reference translation. This is a minor formatting issue.

Overall, the machine translation adds unnecessary words and potentially changes the meaning slightly by suggesting a current additional burden, whereas the reference translation is more faithful to the source text in terms of content and structure.

|Source: यसपछी हतियार भेला गर्ने भोक जागेको यो भीडः बेस्टाइलको किल्लातिर गयो , जुन पेरिसबाट तीन माइल टाढा थियो ।|
|Machine translation: The hunger that gathered the weapons soon went to the fortress of béstile, which was three miles from Paris.|
|Reference translation: Then, hungry for weapons, the mob marched to the castle of Bastille, three miles from Paris.|

|Analysis|
1. **Time expression**: The source text uses ""यसपछी"" (yasphale) which means ""then"" or ""afterwards"", but the machine translation omits this, making the sequence less clear.
2. **Subject and verb**: The source text describes the crowd ""भोक जागेको"" (bho kajageko) as ""hungry"" and ""gathered"" the weapons, while the machine translation reverses the order, saying ""The hunger that gathered the weapons"" which is less natural in English.
3. **Action description**: The source text uses ""भेला गर्ने"" (bhela garna) to describe the action of gathering weapons, which is translated as ""gathered"" in the machine translation, but the reference translation uses ""marched"" (marched to) which is a more suitable verb for the context.
4. **Location**: Both translations correctly identify the location as ""बेस्टाइलको किल्लातिर"" (bastileko killatir) and ""three miles from Paris"", but the machine translation uses ""fortress of béstile"" while the reference uses ""castle of Bastille"", which is a more common term for the historical site.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of time expression, verb choice, and the specific term for the location (castle vs. fortress). The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the original Nepali text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

|Source: रियल म्याड्रिडले यसमा क्षमायाचनाको माग गर्यो र  ब्लाटरले माफी पनि मागे।|
|Machine translation: Real Madrid demanded forgiveness in it and blatter also demanded forgiveness.|
|Reference translation: Real Madrid demanded an apology, and Blatter also apologized.|

Analysis:
1. The source text states that ""रियल म्याड्रिडले यसमा क्षमायाचनाको माग गर्यो"" which means ""Real Madrid demanded an apology"" (requesting an act of contrition or regret).
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Real Madrid demanded forgiveness in it"", suggesting that Madrid was demanding forgiveness for something within the context, which is not clear from the source.

3. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning by saying ""Real Madrid demanded an apology.""

4. Moving to the second part, ""ब्लाटरले माफी पनि मागे"" means ""Blatter also demanded forgiveness,"" while the machine translation again incorrectly translates it as ""blatter also demanded forgiveness,"" without specifying what ""it"" refers to.

5. The reference translation clarifies this by stating ""Blatter also apologized,"" which indicates that Blatter offered an apology, not just demanded it.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not accurately convey the request for an apology from Real Madrid and the act of apologizing from Blatter, instead implying a demand for forgiveness in an unclear context. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: निबन्धात्मक शैलीका पत्र र पत्रात्मक शैलीका निबन्धलाई निपत्र भनिन्छ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The Banquet of letters and lettering styles of nebulous styles is called nebulous.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Essay-style letters and letter-style essays are called Nipatra.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the source text
- The source text mentions ""निबन्धात्मक शैलीका पत्र"" (essay-style letters) and ""पत्रात्मक शैलीका निबन्ध"" (letter-style essays), which are two separate concepts.
- The machine translation combines these concepts into ""letters and lettering styles of nebulous styles,"" which is not accurate.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation translates ""निपत्र"" (essays) as ""nebulous,"" which is incorrect. The correct term in the context of the reference translation is ""Nipatra.""
- The reference translation correctly identifies the two types of writings as ""Essay-style letters"" and ""letter-style essays.""

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. It incorrectly combines the two concepts, ""essay-style letters"" and ""letter-style essays,"" and translates ""निपत्र"" as ""nebulous"" instead of ""Nipatra."" The reference translation accurately captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

- कारण (cause)
- नेवार समुदायमा (Newar community)
- वृद्धाश्रमको आवश्यकता (need for old age homes)
- नभएको (not arisen)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: The cause of which is assumed to be not necessarily an increase in native communities.
- Reference translation: Due to which, there has been no need for old age homes in the Newar community.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""वृद्धाश्रमको आवश्यकता"" (need for old age homes) as ""an increase in native communities,"" which is not the intended meaning. The reference translation correctly conveys the need for old age homes in the Newar community.
- The machine translation also omits the phrase ""नेवार समुदायमा"" (Newar community), which is crucial for context.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of accurately conveying the need for old age homes specifically in the Newar community and misunderstanding the phrase ""वृद्धाश्रमको आवश्यकता."" The reference translation is more faithful to the source text.

|Machine translation: Hajjur has troubled us in my palace, and has requested mercy to tell the majority of hajjur's intentions.|
|Reference translation: You have blessed us by your presence here. Please tell us the main purpose of your arrival.|

|Analysis|
1. **Difference in expression**: The machine translation uses ""troubled us"" which might imply a negative connotation, while the source and reference translations use a more positive expression, ""blessed us"" to describe the effect of the visitor's presence.
2. **Misinterpretation of ""कष्ट गरी""**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""कष्ट गरी"" (causing trouble) as ""troubled us,"" whereas it should be understood as a polite way of acknowledging the visitor's presence, which might not necessarily mean trouble.
3. **Misinterpretation of ""मुख्य अभिप्राय""**: The machine translation translates ""मुख्य अभिप्राय"" (main purpose) as ""majority of hajjur's intentions,"" which is a misinterpretation. It should be translated as the main reason for the visit.
4. **Request for information**: The machine translation incorrectly phrases the request as ""to tell the majority of hajjur's intentions,"" while the reference translation is clearer and more direct, asking for ""the main purpose of your arrival.""

In summary, the machine translation loses the positive tone, misinterprets the cause of the visitor's presence, and incorrectly translates the request for information. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original meaning.

|Machine translation: So the goddess of the blue berries can also be heard taking an avatar in every episode to destroy the underworld and defend the religion.|
|Reference translation: Therefore , it is believed that Lord Vishnu of blue color takes incarnation in every age to destroy sin and protect religion.|

|Analysis|
1. **""नील बर्णका भगवान बिष्णु""** (Lord Vishnu of blue color) vs. **""the goddess of the blue berries""**: The machine translation incorrectly identifies Lord Vishnu as a goddess, which is a significant difference in gender and deity.
2. **""अधर्मको नाश""** (destroying sin) vs. **""destroy the underworld""**: The machine translation omits the context of sin and instead translates it as the destruction of the underworld, which is not accurate according to the source text.
3. **""धर्मको रक्षा""** (protecting religion) vs. **""defend the religion""**: The meaning is preserved, but the word order is slightly different, which might affect the clarity of the translation.

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""उनीप्रति बफादार भई काम गरेकाले"" (loyally worked for him), which implies a sense of dedication and support. The machine translation, however, incorrectly translates this as ""he worked with bafadar devi,"" suggesting a collaboration with a specific person named Bafadar Devi, which is not present in the source text.
2. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning that the loyalty of Mohan Bahadur Karki, Lok Bahadur Rana, and others made it easier for the subject to strengthen the security system. The machine translation omits the word ""सुद्रढ"" (stronger) and ""सुद्रढ बनाउन"" (strengthen), which are crucial to convey the intended impact of their support.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: काखमा बसेको वा सुतेको बेला पनि त्यसो गर्न सकिन्छ ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: It can also be done when sitting in the arms or lying.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: That can be done while sitting on the lap or sleeping.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""sitting in the arms"" which is ""काखमा बसेको"" in Nepali. In the reference translation, it is translated as ""sitting on the lap"" which is more accurate and commonly used in English.
- The machine translation uses ""lying"" which is ""सुतेको"" in Nepali. The reference translation uses ""sleeping"" which is a more suitable verb in this context, as it refers to the state of being in a horizontal position.

Step 5: Identify differences
- The main difference is the translation of ""काखमा बसेको"" (sitting in the arms) to ""sitting on the lap"" in the reference translation, which is more precise.
- The reference translation also uses ""sleeping"" instead of ""lying,"" which is a more natural choice in the context.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the specific action (""sitting in the arms"" vs. ""sitting on the lap"") and the verb choice (""lying"" vs. ""sleeping""). The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic in English.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation omits the concept of illness, which is crucial to understanding the context.
- The machine translation introduces an unrelated term ""insurance"" that does not appear in the source text.

|Reference translation:| The Nepali Congress has been established by the youths who dare to overthrow the dictatorial government as soon as possible.

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""तानाशाही सरकार"" (dictatorial government), which is not accurately translated as ""Tanashahi government"" in the machine translation. The machine translation seems to interpret ""तानाशाही"" as a name or title, while it actually means ""dictatorial.""
2. The phrase ""शीघ्रातिशीघ्र खतम गरी"" (as soon as possible) is not translated correctly in the machine translation. It is translated as ""in quicksilver,"" which does not convey the urgency or immediacy of the action.
3. The reference translation captures the meaning of ""देशोन्नति गर्न हिम्मत गर्ने"" (daring to bring about development) and the context of youths establishing the Nepali Congress for a specific purpose, while the machine translation does not convey this meaning.

Overall, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accurately conveying the meaning, context, and specific reference to the dictatorial government and the youths' motivation.

|Machine translation: The man who takes birth is born to worship the balcony, and he takes birth to his house.|
|Reference translation: A person born in this constellation follows a tradition of worshiping bamboo bushes and sets up bamboo bushes around the house.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""नक्षत्रमा जन्म लिने व्यक्तिले"" (a person born in this constellation), which is translated to ""The man who takes birth"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""A person born in this constellation.""
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""बाँसको झाङको पूजा"" (worshiping bamboo bushes) as ""worship the balcony."" The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of this phrase.
3. The machine translation also incorrectly translates ""तिनले आफ्नो घरबारीमा बाँसको झाङ लगाउने गर्दछन्"" (and he sets up bamboo bushes around the house) as ""and he takes birth to his house."" The reference translation correctly renders this as ""sets up bamboo bushes around the house.""

In summary, the machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the incorrect interpretation of ""worshiping bamboo bushes"" and the placement of the action within the context of the house.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The same word "" Rai 's order "" has become "" Raika / Raeeka "".

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the source text, the word ""राईका आदेश"" refers to ""Rai's order"" and the phrase ""भन्ने सब्द"" indicates that the word is being used in a way that suggests it has been split or changed.
- The machine translation translates ""राईका आदेश"" as ""Raika command"" and then states that it is ""subdivided into"" ""Raika / Raika"", which implies a splitting of the word, but it does not capture the possessive aspect (Rai's) or the correct pronunciation variation (राईका vs. रैका).
- The reference translation correctly translates ""राईका आदेश"" as ""Rai 's order"" and then mentions the change as ""has become"" ""Raika / Raeeka"", which indicates the split and the correct pronunciation variation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:
- It does not include the possessive aspect ""Rai's"" in the translation, which is important for understanding the context.
- It does not differentiate the pronunciation variations correctly, using ""Raika / Raika"" instead of ""Raika / Raeeka"" as in the reference translation.

To improve the quality of the Nepali-English translation, the machine translation should reflect the possessive aspect and the correct pronunciation variation, as in the reference translation.

2. Machine translation: It omits the possessive pronoun ""यिनका"" (his) from the source, which is important to maintain the subject-verb agreement and clarity.
3. Machine translation: It incorrectly uses ""published by books"" instead of ""published including"" or ""published which included"" to convey the idea of a collection of works.

|Reference translation: Normaly , it can be seen that the Sun visits the constellation in between 14 to 27 April every year .|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""वैशाख १ गतेदेखि १४ गतेका"" which means ""from 1st to 14th of Vaisakha"" (Vaisakha is the Nepali month corresponding to April). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""1st to 14th year of scientific interest,"" which is not a meaningful phrase in this context.

**Analysis:**

1. **Translation of the year and event**: The source mentions ""सन २०१२ को"" (in 2012), which is not translated accurately in the machine translation. It refers to the year when the event took place. The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""snooker 2012 FIFA,"" which is unrelated to the event being the Ballon d'Or.

2. **Event name**: The source uses ""फिफा बेलोन डी' ओरमा"" (FIFA Ballon d'Or), which is the correct term for the prestigious football award. The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""FIFA BELON D ' Ore,"" which is a nonsensical combination.

3. **Position**: The source states ""दोस्रो भए"" (second place), which is not translated in the machine translation. Instead, the machine translation omits this information, making it unclear about Ronaldo's position.

4. **Verb choice**: The source uses ""भए"" (finished), which is a more natural verb choice in Nepali to indicate the completion of an event. The machine translation does not include this verb, making the sentence less clear.

3. The reference translation correctly translates ""श्रीकृष्णका ज्ञानयोग, भक्तियोग एवं गर्मयोग"" as ""Lord Krishna's Gyan Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, and Garma Yoga.""
4. The phrase ""विस्तारदेखि कहनमा"" (in detail about it) is translated as ""in detail"" in the reference translation, which captures the meaning of the source.
5. ""अर्जुनले फिरदेखि रथारूढ हो युद्धका लागि शंखध्वनि गरे"" is translated as ""Arjuna again sounded the conch shell for war"" in the reference, which accurately reflects the action and purpose.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: वैयक्तिकता, काल्पनिकता, विद्रोहात्मकता, भावुकता, प्रकृतिप्रेम, कृत्रिमताबाट मुक्ति जस्ता कुराहरू स्वच्छन्दतावादी धाराका मूल प्रवृत्ति हुन् ।
- Machine translation: Alienation, immorality, rebellion, virtue, naturalism, salvation from pseudoscience are the root trends of cleanliness patients.

Step 2: Identify key differences.
- The machine translation has mistranslated ""वैयक्तिकता"" (individuality) as ""alienation"", which is incorrect.
- ""काल्पनिकता"" (creativitiy) is translated as ""immorality"", which is a misinterpretation.
- ""विद्रोहात्मकता"" (violence) is translated as ""rebellion"", which is a possible but not the most accurate translation.
- ""भावुकता"" (emotion) is not translated at all.
- ""प्रकृतिप्रेम"" (nature love) is translated as ""salvation from pseudoscience"", which is unrelated to the original meaning.
- ""कृत्रिमताबाट मुक्ति"" (artificiality) is translated as ""salvation"", which is not accurate.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: Discharge of things like individuality, creativity, violence, emotion, nature love, artificiality are major character of Swachandatabadi stream.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately, focusing on the discharge of various qualities rather than translating them into unrelated concepts.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy and meaning. It misinterprets or omits key concepts, while the reference translation provides a more faithful representation of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

|Source: यस प्रकार उसलाई दृढ़ विश्वास थियो कि सर्वोपरि सत्ता जनताको हातमा हुन आवश्यक छ , कुनै एक व्यक्ति वा संस्थाको हातमा होईन।|
|Machine translation: Thus he was a strong believer that the best needed to be in the hands of the seventh people, no one is in the hands of a person or institution.|
|Reference translation: In this way he firmly believed that power should be in the hands of the people , not in the hands of any one person or organization.|

Analysis:
1. **Difference in phrase structure**: The machine translation uses ""the seventh people"" which is not present in the source text. The reference translation correctly uses ""the people"" without specifying a numerical reference.
2. **Misinterpretation of ""सर्वोपरि""**: The machine translation translates ""सर्वोपरि"" as ""the best"", which is not accurate. The word here likely means ""absolute"" or ""entirely"" in the context of power, referring to the complete authority being with the people.
3. **Omission of negation**: The machine translation omits the negation ""कुनै"" (no one) from the source, which is crucial to convey the idea that power should not be in the hands of any individual or institution.

Overall, the machine translation has significant differences in meaning and structure compared to the reference translation. The source text emphasizes the belief in power being with the people as a whole, not the best among them, and the exclusion of any single person or institution.

|Reference translation: If a divorced boy or girl remarries, society does not look them with hate.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to a ""पारपाचुके भएका केटा"" (a boy or girl who has gone through a divorce), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""the boy who is paraphrased by another marriage."" This is a misinterpretation of the context, as ""पारपाचुके"" means ""divorced"" and not ""paraphrased.""
2. The machine translation incorrectly uses ""her"" instead of ""them"" to refer to the divorced boy or girl, which is gender-inclusive in the reference translation.
3. The machine translation states that society ""doesn't look at her hatred,"" while the reference translation correctly says ""society does not look them with hate."" This implies a lack of judgment rather than seeing someone's hatred.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: २००७ साल पूर्व र त्यसपछि २०१८ सालसम्म पनि पूर्व २ नं.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: 2007 Summer East and then 2018 Summer East 2 NO.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Before year 2007 BS and then upto the year 2018 BS east 2 No .

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""Summer East"" instead of ""पूर्व"" (which means ""before"" in Nepali) and ""upto"" (which is not a direct translation but implies a time span in the reference).
- It omits ""सालसम्म"" (which means ""up to the year"" in Nepali) and replaces it with ""2018 Summer East"" without specifying the time frame.
- It translates ""नं"" (abbreviation for ""number"" in Nepali) as ""NO"" which is not a standard translation.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- Incorrect translation of ""पूर्व"" to ""Summer East""
- Lack of translation for ""सालसम्म"" and the time frame
- Incorrect abbreviation ""NO"" for ""नं""

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation because it loses the meaning and context of the original Nepali text, specifically in terms of time and the correct translation of key phrases. The machine translation should be revised to better capture the meaning, such as translating ""पूर्व"" to ""before"" and including the time frame ""सालसम्म"".

|Source: जस्तै पाणिनिद्वारा विरचित अष्टाध्यायीको पतञ्जलिले भाष्य गरेर महाभाष्य नाम दिएका थिए ।|
|Machine translation: Like the patriarch of asturias, who was defeated by the patriarch, he was given a majority name by future.|
|Reference translation: For example, Patanjali did bhasya on the Ashtadhyayi written by Panini and gave the name Mahabhasya.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""जस्तै पाणिनिद्वारा"" (like by Panini), which is a reference to the author of the Ashtadhyayi, a grammar text in Sanskrit. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the patriarch of asturias,"" which is a completely different context and does not match the source.
2. ""विरचित"" (written) is not translated accurately in the machine translation, which omits this part, making it unclear that the Ashtadhyayi is the subject of the discussion.
3. ""अष्टाध्यायीको पतञ्जलिले भाष्य"" (Patanjali's commentary on the Ashtadhyayi) is translated as ""he was given a majority name by future,"" which is a nonsensical phrase and does not convey the meaning of the original text.
4. ""महाभाष्य"" (Mahabhasya) is the name given to the commentary, but the machine translation incorrectly suggests that it was given a name by the future.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of context, accuracy, and meaning. It fails to capture the relationship between Panini, Patanjali, and the Ashtadhyayi, as well as the proper meaning of the source text.

|Reference translation: Pradhan 's analysis that the characters are found carrying the flag because of the deep influence of politics in Devkota 's novel is also justified.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Subject and verb**: The source text refers to ""Pradhan's analysis"" (प्रधानको विश्लेषण), while the machine translation incorrectly omits the possessive ""Pradhan's"" and uses ""the analysis"" (the principle). The reference translation correctly includes ""Pradhan's.""

2. **Cause and effect**: The source text explains that the characters carry flags ""because of the deep influence of politics"" (राजनीतिको गहिरो प्रभाव रहेकै कारण), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it says ""the analysis of the principle that the characters are carrying flags has also been indicated,"" which is a less clear explanation of the cause.

3. **Justification**: The source text implies that the analysis is ""appropriate"" or ""valid"" (औचित्यपूर्ण), while the machine translation uses the word ""indicated"" which does not convey the same level of justification. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""also justified.""

In summary, the machine translation loses some context and clarity, particularly in the explanation of the cause and the level of justification for the analysis. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

|Analysis|
1. The source text discusses the impact of positive and negative thinking on daily life.
2. In the machine translation, the phrase ""सकारात्मक सोचले सहजीकरण"" (facilitation by positive thinking) is translated as ""collaborated with positive thinking,"" which is not an accurate representation of the original meaning. It suggests a cooperation, whereas the source implies a facilitation or ease.
3. The phrase ""नारकीय बनाई छाड्छ"" (negative thinking turns life into a nightmare) is translated as ""leaves the living narrative,"" which is not as vivid or clear as the reference translation's ""makes life hellish.""
4. The structure of the sentence is also slightly different, with the machine translation placing ""while"" at the beginning, which changes the emphasis.

|Reference translation: Growth rate of state is 8.3 percent, the second highest in the country after Delhi.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""जुन दिल्ली पछिको"" (June Delhi), which refers to Delhi being second in a particular context (most likely in terms of development rate). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the best in the nation after Delhi,"" which implies Delhi has the highest rate, not the second.
2. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning by stating ""the second highest in the country after Delhi,"" which aligns with the source's intention.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of Delhi's ranking, incorrectly stating it as the best instead of the second highest. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

Analysis:
1. The source text is about the societal categorization of a group (people not wearing Janai) as Janajati in Nepal.

3. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning, referring to the categorization of a specific group (people without Janai) within the society.

Analysis:
1. **Subject and Object**: The source text refers to ""पितृसत्ता वा मातृसत्तालाई"" (Patriarchy or Matriarchy) as the subject, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""three different patriarchs"" (which is a plural form, suggesting multiple patriarchs instead of the concepts themselves).
2. **Placement**: The source uses ""राखेर"" (placing), which implies the concepts are to be placed or considered in a certain context or framework. The machine translation omits this aspect, using ""placing"" without specifying what is being placed.
3. **Aspects**: The reference translation correctly translates ""विभिन्न पाटाहरुमा"" (three different aspects) to express the idea of analyzing on multiple dimensions. The machine translation, however, does not convey this nuance.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of accurately representing the subject (Patriarchy or Matriarchy), the context of placing, and the concept of analyzing on different aspects.

|Machine translation: And Hanuman exceeded the sea, and found Zita.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""तब"" (then) which is not translated in the machine translation, but is present in the reference translation.
2. ""हनुमानले"" (by Hanuman) is not included in the machine translation, but it is important to indicate the subject in the sentence.
3. ""समुद्रलाई"" (to the sea) is translated as ""the sea"" in the machine translation, but it should be translated as ""jump the ocean"" to convey the intended action.
4. ""नाघेर"" (without hesitation) is not present in the machine translation, which affects the understanding of Hanuman's determination.
5. ""सीता भेटेर"" (after meeting Sita) is translated as ""found Zita"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect as it refers to Sita, not a new character.
6. ""आउने अठोट गरे"" (he jumped with great determination) is not translated accurately, as it describes the action and emotion, which is missing in the machine translation.

|Reference translation: Louis XVI was forced to convene a meeting of the Versailles state general to resolve the growing economic crisis after nearly 150 years.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Subject**: The source text refers to ""लुई सोह्रौले"" (Louis XVI), while the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""Louie sixteen"". This is a significant difference as it changes the identity of the person being discussed.

2. **Timeframe**: The source mentions ""करिव १ सय ५० वर्ष पश्चात"" (around 150 years later), which implies a rough estimate. The machine translation, however, says ""100 50 years later,"" which is a direct numerical value that does not convey the same level of uncertainty.

3. **Action**: The source uses ""बढ्दो आर्थिक संकट समाधान गर्नको लागि"" (to resolve the growing economic crisis), while the machine translation omits the ""बढ्दो"" (growing) part, making the crisis seem static rather than developing.

4. **Forced action**: The reference translation adds the detail that Louis XVI was ""forced to convene"" the meeting, which is not present in the machine translation.

5. **Resolution of the crisis**: The source does not specify the time frame for the meeting, while the machine translation implies it took place after a certain period (100 50 years later), which is not accurate.

In summary, the machine translation has significant differences in terms of the subject, timeframe, and the context of the forced action, leading to a less accurate representation of the source text. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuances of the original Nepali sentence.

|Machine translation: Lately, his analysis from the angle of ideal flow and eastern vision has been incomplete.|

|Analysis|
1. **Time reference**: The machine translation uses ""Lately"" which might imply a recent context, while the reference translation uses ""Therefore"" which suggests a conclusion based on previous information, not necessarily recent events. The source text does not provide a specific time frame, so ""Therefore"" is a more appropriate choice.

2. **Concept of flow**: The machine translation uses ""ideal flow,"" which is not directly found in the source text. The reference translation, ""flow of thought,"" is a more accurate representation of the original concept.

3. **Eastern vision vs Eastern philosophy**: The machine translation refers to ""eastern vision,"" which is not as precise as ""Eastern philosophy"" used in the reference translation. The source text talks about ""पूर्वीय दर्शन"" (Eastern philosophy), which includes a broader range of ideas.

4. **Completeness**: Both translations convey the idea that the analysis is incomplete, but the reference translation uses ""is incomplete"" directly, which is a more straightforward and accurate expression.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of time reference, the specific concept of flow, and the precision of the term ""Eastern vision."" The reference translation better captures the essence of the source text.

|Machine translation: The Buddhist lamas are placed before their book to be texted, and the texted sheet is placed beyond that.|
|Reference translation: The Buddhist lamas placed their book in front of them, and keep to the side the pages that they have read.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject and action**: In the source, the subject ""बौद्ध लामाहरु"" (Buddhist lamas) perform the action ""पुस्तक पाठ गर्दा"" (placing their book before them to read). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""are placed before their book to be texted,"" which suggests an action of being placed rather than placing themselves.
2. **Reading and keeping pages**: The source mentions ""पाठ गरिने पुस्तक"" (the book being read) and ""पाठ गरिसकिएका पाता"" (the pages read), which implies that the lamas keep the read pages aside. The machine translation omits this context, saying ""the texted sheet is placed beyond that,"" which does not convey the act of keeping the read pages separate.
3. **Verb tense and structure**: The source uses the past tense ""राख्तछन्"" (kept) to describe the action of keeping the read pages. The machine translation uses the present tense ""are placed"" and ""is placed,"" which does not match the original tense.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the subject's action, the context of reading and keeping pages, and the verb tense. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the original Nepali sentence.

2. **Term for traditions**: The machine translation uses ""tribal traditions"" which might imply a broader cultural context, whereas the reference translation uses ""lineage"" or ""वंशपरम्परा"" (lineage tradition), which is more accurate in the context of Hindu sages and their teachings.
3. **Sage names**: The machine translation mentions ""four debates"" instead of the sages' names, which is a major error. The reference translation correctly identifies the sages as Marichi, Angira, Atri, and Vashishta.

In conclusion, the machine translation has differences in location specificity, the term for traditions, and the incorrect representation of the sages as debates. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

|Source: पाकिस्तानी तालिबानले पेसावरको विद्यालय हत्याकाण्डमा कालो सूचीमा परेका सैन्य अधिकारीका छोराहरूलाई निशाना बनाइएको बताएको छ।|
|Machine translation: The Pakistani Taliban said the sons of a military officer who was on the black list in the school murders of pesawar.|
|Reference translation: The Pakistani Taliban has said that the sons of a blacklisted military officer were targeted in a school massacre in Peshawar.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject**: Both translations correctly identify the subject as ""the Pakistani Taliban"" (पाकिस्तानी तालिबानले).
2. **Action**: Both mention ""said"" (बताएको) but the machine translation uses ""school murders"" (विद्यालय हत्याकाण्डमा) while the reference uses ""school massacre"" (school massacre), which is a more accurate term for a mass killing at a school.
3. **Target**: The machine translation states ""the sons of a military officer who was on the black list"" (कालो सूचीमा परेका सैन्य अधिकारीका छोराहरूलाई), while the reference translation simplifies it to ""the sons of a blacklisted military officer"" (a blacklisted military officer's sons). The reference is clearer and more concise.
4. **Location**: The machine translation mentions ""pesawar"" (पेसावर) without context, while the reference adds ""in Peshawar"" (Peshawar), providing the necessary geographical information.

|Source: चन्द नेपालको सुदूर पश्चिम, मध्य पश्चिम हुँदै नेपाल भरी बसोवास भएका चन्द्र वंशी क्षेत्रीय ठकुरी मध्यको एक थर हो ।|
|Machine translation: Chand is a surname of the moon heritage regional solidarity middle of Nepal via Sudhur West, Central West.|
|Reference translation: Chand is a surname of the moon heritage regional solidarity middle of Nepal via far-West, Central West.|

|Analysis|
1. **Sudhur पश्चिम** (Sudhur West) vs. **far-West**:
   - The machine translation uses ""Sudhur West,"" which is a specific region, while the reference translation uses ""far-West"" to convey a more general sense of the westernmost part of Nepal. The reference might be referring to a broader area than just Sudhur West.

2. **मध्य पश्चिम** (Central West) is the same in both translations.

3. The rest of the sentence structure and meaning is similar in both translations.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the description of the western region, specifically by using ""Sudhur West"" instead of the more general ""far-West."" This difference affects the level of detail and the broader geographical context provided in the translation. The reference translation might be more suitable for a general audience or a context where a broader regional reference is intended.

|Machine translation: In all games of the world group stage, he was elected the best player.|
|Reference translation: He was chosen the best player in the group stage of all games in World Cup.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Subject and verb**: The source text uses ""उनी"" (he/she) as the subject and ""चुनिए"" (was chosen) as the verb. The machine translation correctly captures this as ""he was elected"", but the reference translation uses ""He was chosen"", which is more natural in English.

2. **World Cup vs. World group stage**: The source text refers to ""विश्वकपको समुह"" (World Cup group), while the machine translation generalizes it to ""world group stage"". The reference translation correctly specifies ""World Cup"" as the context.

3. **Order of phrases**: The source text places ""सबै खेलमा"" (in all games) before ""समुह चरणको"" (group stage), while the machine translation reverses the order. The reference translation follows the source's structure.

4. **Adjective placement**: The source text uses ""सर्वोत्कृष्ट"" (best) as an adjective to describe ""खेलाडी"" (player). The machine translation and reference translation both maintain this adjective-adjective relationship.

|Source: असाध्य शारीरिक र मानसिक रोग निवारण र ज्ञान प्राप्तीको लागि १५ दिने यात्रा गर्नु पर्छ।|
|Machine translation: Influential and mental illnesses must travel to 15 days for knowledge or molecular obligations.|
|Reference translation: One has to travel for 15 days to cure incurable physical and mental diseases and to attain knowledge or salvation.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Translation of ""असाध्य"" (incurable):**
   - Machine translation: ""Influential"" (which does not match the meaning of ""incurable"" in this context)
   - Reference translation: ""incurable"" (correctly translated)

2. **Translation of ""शारीरिक"" (physical):**
   - Machine translation: Not present (missing in the translation)
   - Reference translation: ""physical"" (correctly translated)

3. **Translation of ""मानसिक"" (mental):**
   - Machine translation: ""mental illnesses"" (correctly translated)
   - Reference translation: ""mental"" (translated as an adjective, but the phrase is not ""mental illnesses"" in the source)

4. **Translation of ""निवारण"" (cure):**
   - Machine translation: Not present (missing in the translation)
   - Reference translation: ""cure"" (correctly translated)

5. **Translation of ""ज्ञान"" (knowledge):**
   - Machine translation: ""knowledge or molecular obligations"" (molecular obligations are not mentioned in the source)
   - Reference translation: ""knowledge"" (correctly translated)

6. **Translation of ""प्राप्ती"" (attainment):**
   - Machine translation: ""obligations"" (incorrect, should be ""attainment"" or ""salvation"")
   - Reference translation: ""attainment"" (correctly translated)

7. **Translation of ""लागि"" (for the purpose of):**
   - Machine translation: Not present (missing in the translation)
   - Reference translation: ""for"" (correctly translated)

8. **Translation of ""१५ दिने"" (15 days):**
   - Both translations: ""15 days"" (correctly translated)

9. **Translation of ""यात्रा गर्नु पर्छ"" (has to travel):**
   - Machine translation: ""must travel"" (correctly translated)
   - Reference translation: ""has to travel"" (correctly translated)

**Overall, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of accurately conveying the meaning of ""incurable"" and ""cure,"" as well as in the structure of the sentence. It also adds unnecessary elements like ""influential"" and ""molecular obligations"" that are not present in the source.**

|Source: माओवादी शान्तिप्रक्रियामा आएको झन्डै १० वर्ष पुग्न लाग्दा पनि पासाङले कुनै पनि सुविधाको पद लिनुभएको थिएन ।|
|Machine translation: Although the pasang had not taken the post of any convenience for nearly 10 years, during the maoist peace response.|
|Reference translation: Pasang had not taken any position of privilege even when it had already been almost 10 years that Maoist entered into peace process.|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation starts with ""Although"" which is not present in the source text, which might create a misleading impression about a condition.
2. The machine translation uses ""convenience"" instead of ""privilege"" in the context, which changes the meaning of the sentence. The source text refers to a position of advantage or special treatment, not just a convenient one.
3. The machine translation places ""during the maoist peace response"" at the end, which is not a direct translation of the source's ""माओवादी शान्तिप्रक्रियामा आएको झन्डै"" (while Maoist peace process was ongoing). The reference translation correctly captures this as ""even when it had already been almost 10 years that Maoist entered into peace process.""

Overall, the machine translation loses some nuances and changes the meaning, particularly in the context of the position and the timing of the Maoist peace process. The reference translation is more accurate in conveying the original meaning.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: पूर्णरुपमा अफ्रिकाली राष्ट्रिय पार्टीले सन् १९४८ को चुनाव जितेपछि मण्डेलाले राजनीतिमा सक्रिय रुपमा भाग लिन थाले ।
- Machine translation: After the fully elected Africa National Party won the 1948 elections, the assembly actively participated in politics.

Difference: The machine translation omits the word ""पूर्णरुपमा"" (completely) from the source, which is crucial to convey the full meaning of the sentence.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: After the fully elected Africa National Party won the 1948 elections, the assembly actively participated in politics.
- Reference translation: After Africa National Party completely won the 1948 elections, Mandela actively participated in politics.

Difference: The machine translation refers to ""the assembly"" instead of specifying ""मण्डेलाले"" (Mandela), which is the subject of the sentence in the source.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in two aspects:
1. It omits the word ""पूर्णरुपमा"" (completely) from the source, which affects the accuracy of the translation.
2. It does not specify that Mandela was the one who actively participated in politics, which is important context.

To improve the quality of the translation, the machine translation should include the word ""पूर्णरुपमा"" and specify ""मण्डेलाले"" to convey the intended meaning more accurately.

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions that the Russian voters have always supported Putin and their actions have prevented Russia from moving forward.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""भोट गरेर"" (voted for Putin) as ""adopted pagal's promise"" and ""रुसलाई अघि बढ्नबाट वञ्चित गरेको"" (prevented Russia from progressing) as ""Putin was prohibited from proceeding to Russia by only featuring Putin.""
3. The reference translation correctly conveys the meaning that the lyricist refers to the voters as ""crazy"" and that their voting pattern has stopped Russia's progress.

Step 1: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- हामीले (we)
- पनि (also)
- आफूलाई (from you)
- उपर्युक्त (above)
- विकारहरुबाट (from disorders)
- मुक्त गर्न (free ourselves)
- सकेमा (can)
- सहजै (easily)
- ईश्वर (God)
- प्राप्त गर्न (attain)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""We can also obtain a fellow God if we can free ourselves from substantial developments.""
- Reference translation: ""If we can free ourselves from the above disorders, we can easily attain God.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences:
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""आफूलाई"" (from you) as ""substantial developments"" which is not accurate. It should be translated as ""from the above disorders"" (उपर्युक्त विकारहरुबाट) as in the reference.
- ""फेलो"" (fellow) is missing in the machine translation, which is implied by ""आफूलाई"" in the source text, referring to freeing oneself from the same condition as the listener.
- ""प्राप्त गर्न"" (attain) is translated as ""obtain"" in the machine translation, but the context suggests a more spiritual attainment, which is better captured by ""प्राप्त गर्न"" in the reference.

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences in terms of the meaning of ""from you"" and the context of attaining God, which are not accurately conveyed. The reference translation better captures the original Nepali text's meaning.

|Machine translation: When the jeans go to the tamangs, the damangs go unnoticed and the damangs play themselves.|
|Reference translation: In Tamang community Damfu is played instead of Daamai Baja when they go to Janti and Tamangs themselves paly Damfus.|

|Analysis|
1. **""जन्ती जाँदा""** (When they go to Janti) - Machine translation: ""When the jeans go to the tamangs"" - The source refers to a group of people (जन्ती) going to a place (Janti), while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""jeans"" going to tamangs, which is a misinterpretation of the context.
2. **""दमाईं बाजा""** (Daamai Baja) - Machine translation: ""the damangs go unnoticed"" - The source is about a musical activity (Daamai Baja) being replaced by something else, not about damangs being unnoticed. The machine translation misses this musical context.
3. **""नबजाएर""** (instead of) - Machine translation: ""and the damangs play themselves"" - The source implies a change in the activity, not that the damangs are playing themselves. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of ""instead of.""
4. **""डम्फु बजाउँदै""** (play Damfu) - Machine translation: ""the damangs play themselves"" - The source specifically mentions Damfu being played, not the damangs playing themselves. The reference translation is more accurate.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of context, musical activity, and the intended meaning of the phrase ""जन्ती जाँदा."" The machine translation loses the cultural and social context, as well as the specific musical substitution, while the reference translation accurately captures these elements.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: It is known from the genealogical tamra etc. of bhangiraja mentioned in.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The genology of the Bajhangi King mentioned here are learnt from the copper cravings.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""genealogical tamra"" which is not as accurate as ""वंशावली"" (genealogy) in the source text. It also omits the word ""सामग्री"" (content) which is important for context.
- The reference translation uses ""copper cravings"" to describe ""ताम्रपत्र"" (copper inscriptions), which is a more accurate and idiomatic expression than ""mentioned in"" in the machine translation.
- The reference translation refers to ""the Bajhangi King"" instead of ""bhangiraja,"" which is a more specific and correct term.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, specificity, and idiomatic expression. The machine translation could be improved by using ""वंशावली"" for genealogy, retaining ""सामग्री"" for context, and specifying ""Bajhangi King"" instead of ""bhangiraja.""

|Machine translation: At first the government had given private levels to the oil industries whose operations would be controlled by American negotiators.|
|Reference translation: The previous government allowed the oil industry to remain private level, controlled by US corporations.|

|Analysis|
1. **Time reference**: The source text uses ""पहिलाका"" (previous) to refer to the government, while the machine translation omits this context, making it unclear whether it's referring to the first or previous government.
2. **Action description**: The source states that the government ""दिएका थिए"" (had given), which implies a past action, while the machine translation uses ""had given"" in a similar past tense but without the context of time.
3. **Level description**: The source uses ""निजी स्तरमै"" (private level) to describe the status of the oil industry, and the reference translation correctly maintains this phrase. The machine translation, however, uses ""private levels"" which is less precise and could imply multiple levels rather than a single status.
4. **Control mechanism**: The source specifies that the operations would be ""नियन्त्रण हुने गर्दथ्यो"" (controlled by American negotiators), while the machine translation simplifies this to ""controlled by American negotiators.""

- यति कुरा (bearing this in mind)
- ध्यानमा राखेर (while keeping in mind)
- साहित्य अध्ययन (literature study)
- सामग्री संकलन (collection of materials)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation: 
- ""To focus solely on religious studies"" (This is a misinterpretation, as the source text does not mention religious studies specifically, but rather the broader context of literature.)
- ""and materials must be collected"" (The reference translation uses ""and"" to connect two actions, while the machine translation suggests a cause-and-effect relationship.)

Reference translation:
- ""By bearing this in mind"" (Matches the source text, maintaining the context of keeping something in mind.)
- ""literature should be studied"" (Matches the source text, preserving the action of studying literature.)
- ""and materials should be collected"" (Matches the source text, maintaining the parallel action of collecting materials.)

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""साहित्य अध्ययन"" as ""religious studies,"" which is not supported by the source text.
- The machine translation presents the two actions (literature study and material collection) as if they are the only focus, while the reference translation implies that they should be done in conjunction with the initial context.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality because it misinterprets the context and specifically mentions religious studies, which is not present in the source text. It also presents the actions as separate and more exclusive than the reference translation, which maintains a more balanced and accurate representation of the original meaning.

- ""महत्त्वपूर्ण"" (significant)
- ""एकादशीको व्रतको"" (fast of Ekadashi)

- Reference translation: ""The day of Ekadashi is as important as the Ekadashi fast.""

Step 3: Analyze differences
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""एकादशी"" (Ekadashi) as ""akkadian third"" and ""व्रतको"" (fast) as ""betrayal of the significant akkkadian third."" This is a misunderstanding of the context, as ""Ekadashi"" is a Hindu religious observance, not an ""akkadian"" concept, and the term ""fast"" is not translated accurately as ""betrayal.""
- The machine translation also adds the word ""third"" which is not present in the source text.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of cultural context and word choice. It incorrectly translates ""Ekadashi"" and ""fast"" and adds irrelevant information about an ""akkadian third.""

2. **Change in profession**: The machine translation says ""Nepali architecture of pageda style,"" which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly identifies the profession as ""नेपाली वास्तुकार"" (Nepali sculpturist) for the discovery of ""pageda style"" temples, not architecture.
3. **Misinterpretation of ""चैत्य""**: The machine translation translates ""चैत्य"" as ""chai,"" which is a beverage, but in this context, it likely refers to ""stupa,"" a Buddhist religious monument. The reference translation correctly identifies it as a stupa.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in the interpretation of the source text, specifically regarding the type of discovery (cloth vs. temple), the profession involved (sculpturist vs. architecture), and the meaning of ""चैत्य"" (stupa). The reference translation provides a more accurate representation of the source text.

|Source: यस कथाको भाव यही हो कि भक्तिको सामु दुष्ट ग्रहले पनि केही बिगार्न सक्दैन।|
|Machine translation: The virtue of this story is that the evil planet cannot be damaged before the devil.|
|Reference translation: The implication of this story is that even an evil planet cannot harm anything in the face of devotion.|

Analysis:
1. **Difference in meaning**: The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the source text. The source talks about the ""bhāv"" (feeling or implication) of the story, not the ""virtue"" (which is not mentioned in the source). The machine translation incorrectly translates ""भक्तिको सामु"" (devotion's power) as ""the devil,"" which is not accurate.

2. **Misinterpretation of ""भक्तिको"":** The machine translation incorrectly translates ""भक्तिको"" (devotion) as ""the devil,"" which is a significant error. The reference translation correctly uses ""devotion"" to convey the idea that even an evil force cannot harm when devotion is present.

3. **Lack of context**: The machine translation misses the context of the story's message, which is about the inability of an evil planet to harm due to devotion, not the damage being done before some external force.

4. **Rephrasing**: The reference translation rephrases the source to emphasize the idea that devotion is a protective force, while the machine translation does not capture this nuance.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of meaning, context, and the interpretation of key phrases. The reference translation better conveys the intended message of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: यो क्याम्पसको स्थापना पछि नेपालमा उच्च शिक्षा आर्जन धेरै सहज हुनपुगेको थियो।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: After the establishment of this campus, higher education facilities in Nepal were too collapsed.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: After the establishment of this campus, getting higher education in Nepal became very easy.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation states ""higher education facilities in Nepal were too collapsed,"" which implies a negative state, while the source text and reference translation suggest a positive outcome, that higher education became ""sahaj"" (easy).
- The reference translation omits the word ""dhेरै"" (very) from the source, which might be a loss of emphasis on the ease.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the tone and the level of ease conveyed. The machine translation incorrectly implies a collapse of facilities, while the reference translation accurately captures the ease with which higher education became accessible after the campus was established. The loss of the word ""dhेरै"" in the reference translation might also affect the intensity of the statement.

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the source text
- ""यस्तो प्रतिज्ञा"" (this promise)
- ""गरेर"" (by)
- ""ईन्द्र"" (Indra, a Hindu god, often associated with marriage)
- ""विवाह स्थल"" (wedding place, tent or stable, depending on context)
- ""गएका"" (went out)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""By this promise the moon went out of the wedding stable.""
- Reference translation: ""By this promise the Indra went out of the wedding tent.""

Difference analysis:
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""ईन्द्र"" as ""moon"" instead of ""Indra.""
- The machine translation uses ""stable"" which is not the typical Nepali term for a wedding place, while the reference translation uses ""tent"" which is more appropriate in the context of a wedding.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in two main aspects:
1. It incorrectly identifies the subject as the moon (which is not the Indra) instead of the deity Indra.
2. It uses ""stable"" instead of ""tent"" to describe the wedding place, which changes the meaning and cultural context.

To improve the quality of the translation, the machine should have recognized ""ईन्द्र"" as a proper noun referring to the god and translated it as ""Indra,"" and used ""tent"" instead of ""stable"" to maintain the cultural context.

- बालविवाह प्रथा (child marriage practice)
- अन्त भएपछि (after its end)
- प्रतीक स्वरूप (symbolic form)
- ईही गर्ने गरिएको (is done or practised)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: After the end of the child, its symbol is formed.
- Reference translation: After the abolition of child marriage, Ihi is practised as its symbol.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""बालविवाह प्रथा"" (child marriage practice) as ""the child,"" which is not accurate.
- The machine translation omits the word ""abolition"" or the concept of it being stopped, which is crucial for understanding the context.
- The machine translation incorrectly states that ""its symbol is formed,"" while the reference translation specifies that ""Ihi is practised as its symbol,"" which implies a cultural practice rather than just a formation.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, context, and the specific cultural reference. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text, emphasizing the practice of Ihi as a symbol after the end of child marriage.

- The machine translation also uses ""this"" to refer to the ""20 shows,"" while the reference translation uses ""the trip"" to maintain context.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is of lower quality due to the incorrect interpretation of ""२० वटा शोहरू"" as ""shops"" and the lack of clarity in referring to the subject as ""the trip"" instead of ""this show."" The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the source text.

|Source: बाल भैरव र बटुक भैरव जस्तै मष्टा देवतालाई पनि गाईको दुधको भोग लगाएर पूजा गर्ने प्रचलन रहेको छ।|
|Machine translation: The Masta goddess as baal verma and batu verma is also prominent in worshiping cow's milk.|
|Reference translation: Like Bal Bhairav and Batuk Bhairav, the deity Mashta is also worshiped by offering cow's milk.|
|Analysis:|
1. **Subject identification**: The source mentions ""बाल भैरव"" and ""बटुक भैरव"" as examples, while the machine translation refers to ""Masta goddess as baal verma and batu verma."" The reference translation correctly identifies them as deities, not as types of the goddess.
2. **Comparison of worship**: The source states that the practice of offering cow's milk (पनि गाईको दुधको भोग) is popular for these deities. The machine translation incorrectly suggests that the Masta goddess is prominent in worshiping cow's milk, which could imply that she is the main focus, whereas the reference translation correctly conveys that the offering is done for Mashta, not the goddess herself.
3. **Structure and clarity**: The source sentence structure is clear, with ""जस्तै"" (like) connecting the examples. The machine translation loses this connection, making it less clear that Mashta is being compared to Bal Bhairav and Batuk Bhairav. The reference translation maintains this connection.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its identification of the deities, the clarity of the worship context, and the connection between Mashta and Bal Bhairav and Batuk Bhairav. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: She was an ardent woman of five paddies, considered to be one of the ancient narrators.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: She was wife of the five Pandavas. She is considered as one of the ancient feminists.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation refers to ""an ardent woman of five paddies"" which does not convey the same meaning as the source text, which implies that she was the wife of the five Pandavas.
- The machine translation mentions ""ancient narrators,"" while the reference translation translates it as ""ancient feminists,"" which is a more accurate interpretation of the context, as it aligns with the cultural reference to the character in the Hindu epic, Mahabharata.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation omits the fact that she is the wife of the Pandavas, which is crucial to understanding the context.
- The machine translation's ""ardent woman of five paddies"" is a literal translation that does not convey the intended meaning, while the reference translation captures the essence by referring to her as a ""feminist.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the relationship to the Pandavas and the interpretation of her significance as an ancient figure. The reference translation provides a more accurate cultural context and meaning, identifying her as the wife of the Pandavas and a feminist, while the machine translation does not capture these nuances.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Police raided the house on suspicion that he might reach home for mother 's last death anniversary.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The source text mentions ""अन्तिम पुण्यतिथिमा"" (last death anniversary), which is translated as ""mother's funeral"" in the reference translation.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""उहाँ घर पुग्न सक्ने"" (he could reach home) as ""he could reach home"" without specifying the context of the funeral.
- The machine translation states ""shot by the police"" while the reference translation uses ""raided the house,"" which implies a search rather than an act of violence.

Step 5: Identify differences
- The machine translation incorrectly assumes a violent event (shot) when the source text suggests a raid or search.
- The context of the event is not accurately conveyed in the machine translation, as it does not mention the death anniversary.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the context and the nature of the police action. The reference translation provides a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the situation, while the machine translation loses some important details and implies a different event.

|Machine translation: To examine the legitimacy of all gods and debt honeymoons.|
|Reference translation: To examine the perfection of all gods and sages and greatsages.|

|Analysis|
1. **""सबै देवता""** (all gods) - In the machine translation, it is translated as ""legitimacy of all gods,"" which is not an accurate representation of the original meaning. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""the perfection of all gods.""
2. **""र""** (and) - The conjunction is correctly translated in both machine and reference translations.
3. **""ऋषि""** (sages) - The machine translation omits this term, which is crucial to the context. In the reference translation, it is included as ""sages and.""
4. **""महर्षिहरू""** (greatsages) - This term is not present in the machine translation, but it is included in the reference translation. It is an important part of the phrase, referring to the highest level of spiritual attainments.
5. **""सिद्धताको परिक्षण""** (the examination of perfection) - The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""legitimacy,"" which does not convey the idea of evaluating the perfection or accomplishment of the gods and sages.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the accuracy and completeness of the concepts. The machine translation omits important terms like ""sages"" and ""greatsages"" and incorrectly translates ""सिद्धताको परिक्षण"" as ""legitimacy"" instead of ""the examination of perfection.""

2. **Country name**: The source text mentions ""आइभोरिकोस्टलाई"" (Ivoricost), which is a misspelling or incorrect representation of ""Ivory Coast"" in Nepali. The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""Ivoricost,"" while the reference translation correctly uses ""Ivory Coast.""
3. **Capitalization**: The reference translation capitalizes ""Cost"" in ""Ivory Coast"" as it should be, while the machine translation does not.

**Analysis:**

1. **Subject identification**: In the source text, ""माईलोपट्टिले"" refers to ""the second son"" (Milophar in the context of a proper noun, but the reference translation uses ""the second son"" for clarity). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Milophar,"" which is a name and not a reference to the second son.

2. **Verb and action**: The source text uses ""व्यवस्थापन गर्ने गर्दछ"" which means ""manages to become"" or ""strives to attain."" The machine translation omits this context and simply says ""becomes a justice,"" which is not accurate as it implies a specific role rather than the process of becoming.

3. **Role and context**: ""वीरजयको धामी"" refers to ""the Dhami of Wirjay"" (Wirjay is likely a place or a title related to the Dhami profession). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""justice of the wirjay,"" which is a different role and does not convey the same meaning.

4. **Proper noun**: ""Birjaya"" is a proper noun in the reference translation, likely referring to a specific place or context, while the machine translation does not include this detail.

In summary, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of subject identification, verb context, role, and the inclusion of a proper noun. The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text.

Analysis:

2. **Adjective and noun**: The source specifies ""एक लाख भन्दा बढि"" (more than one million), while the machine translation omits this phrase, making it unclear about the exact number of copies sold.
3. **Qualifier (youngest)**: The reference translation adds the qualifier ""the youngest"" to describe Britney's achievement, which is not present in the machine translation.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The clothes are like Brahmins, the behavior is like evil.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- In the machine translation, ""लुगा ब्राह्मणका"" is translated as ""the clothes are like brains,"" which is a literal translation that doesn't capture the intended meaning. The source text refers to ""लुगा"" (clothes) being similar to ""ब्राह्मणका"" (Brahmin's), which is a reference to a specific caste or class in Nepali culture, not to actual brains.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""ब्राह्मणका"" as ""Brahmins,"" which is a more accurate cultural reference.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The main difference is the translation of ""ब्राह्मणका"" in the machine translation, which is not translated appropriately as ""Brahmins.""
- The machine translation also omits the cultural context, which is important in understanding the intended meaning.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: The Historic Gorge is situated on the mathiplo peak of the market.
- Reference translation: The historic Gorkha Durbar ( Palace ) is located at the top of the bazaar.

Step 3: Analyze differences
- The machine translation refers to ""Gorge"" instead of ""Gorkha Durbar"" (Palace), which is a significant difference as the source text specifically mentions a palace.
- The machine translation uses ""mathiplo peak"" which is likely a mistranslation or a misunderstanding of ""माथील्लो"" (on the top), as it does not convey the palace context.
- The reference translation correctly identifies the palace and uses ""at the top of the bazaar"" which is a more accurate representation of the source's meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation has a significant error in identifying the palace as a ""gorge"" and mistranslates the location as a ""mathiplo peak"" instead of specifying the top of the bazaar. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

1. **Time expression**: The source uses ""अहिले"" (nowadays) which is translated to ""Now"" in the reference, indicating the same time frame.
2. **Proper noun**: ""रुद्रमणीका सन्तानहरू"" (children of Rudramani) is a compound noun, where ""रुद्रमणी"" is a name and ""सन्तानहरू"" means children. The machine translation omits the possessive form ""का"" and combines the name into ""rudram"", which is not accurate.
3. **Location**: ""कैलाली जिल्लाको"" (Kailali district) is translated correctly in both, but the machine translation uses ""kalyan district"" instead of ""Kailali"".
4. **Adverbial phrase**: ""विभिन्न ठाउँहरूमा समेत"" (in various places) is translated to ""in various places"", which is a reasonable approximation but omits the prepositional phrase ""मा समेत"" (together with) in the reference.

Analysis:
1. **""शकिराले ल्याटिन अमेरिका र संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिकाको""** (Shakira in Latin America and the United States) - In the machine translation, it's ""Shakira began a journey of two months named her tur ufibio in Latin America and the United States"", which suggests that the journey was named ""her tur ufibio"" instead of being a separate event. The reference translation correctly states that the journey was called ""Unfibio"".
2. **""आफ्नो""** (her) - The machine translation incorrectly uses ""her"" to describe the journey, which is not appropriate in this context. The reference translation omits this possessive pronoun, which is correct since it's not clear whose journey it is.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- Incorrectly stating that the journey was named ""her tur ufibio"" instead of ""Unfibio"".
- Incorrectly using the possessive pronoun ""her"" in the description of the journey.

|Source: मनुष्यले निर्जला एकादशीका दिन स्नान, दान, जप, होम आदि जे जस्तो कर्म गर्दछ, त्यो संपूर्ण अक्षय हुन पुग्छ यो कथन भगवान श्री कृष्णको हो।|
|Machine translation: The Manufacturer employs the decorative academic day as snakes, Dances, jeeps, homes, etc., to be the complete axis. This statement is of the goddess Mr. Percy.|
|Reference translation: At the day of Nirjala Ekadashi, the types of bath, donation, prayer, sacrifice that human does, all that becomes inexhaustible, the narrative is of Lord Shree Krishna.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Source**: The source text is about human activities (निर्जला एकादशीका दिन स्नान, दान, जप, होम) during Nirjala Ekadashi and their connection to Lord Shree Krishna.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""निर्जला एकादशीका दिन"" (Nirjala Ekadashi day) as ""the decorative academic day"" and attributes it to ""Mr. Percy"" instead of Lord Shree Krishna. It also incorrectly translates ""कर्म"" (activities) as ""snakes, dances, jeeps, homes"" which are unrelated concepts.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation accurately captures the meaning, mentioning ""Nirjala Ekadashi"" and the various activities (bath, donation, prayer, sacrifice) performed by humans, which are then described as becoming ""inexhaustible"" and associated with Lord Shree Krishna.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of cultural context, proper nouns, and the meaning of the source text. The machine translation should be revised to accurately convey the meaning of the original Nepali text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

|Source: शरिर हामीलाई आफ्नो गन्तव्य सम्म पुर्याउने माध्यम हो ।|
|Machine translation: Sherrill is the medium to bring us to their destinations.|
|Reference translation: Body is the means by which we reach our destiny.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text is in Nepali, discussing the body as a means to achieve one's goals or destiny.
2. In the machine translation, ""Sherrill"" is a name that has been incorrectly translated from the Nepali word, which is likely a misinterpretation or a placeholder for a proper noun.
3. The machine translation incorrectly attributes the destination to ""Sherrill"" instead of the body, which is the intended subject in the source text.
4. The phrase ""to their destinations"" in the machine translation suggests a third party is involved, while the source text implies that the body is the means for the speaker's own destiny.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is of poor quality due to the incorrect interpretation of the source text, specifically the confusion between a proper noun (Sherrill) and the concept of the body, and the incorrect attribution of destinations. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text, emphasizing the body as the means to reach one's own destiny.|im_end|

|Machine translation: About 200 years ago, the seven brothers of sanyal from sanni went to ask for a vacation that I would turn to the twins.|
|Reference translation: About 200 years ago , among the Sanyal 's seven brothers from Sanni , the eldest brother Band Chakra Upadhyaya bade farewell to his brother saying that he would go to Jumla .|

|Analysis|
1. **Time reference**: The machine translation incorrectly refers to ""I would turn to the twins"" instead of specifying the eldest brother (Band Chakra Upadhyaya) as the one going to Jumla.
2. **Brother's role**: The machine translation does not mention the brother's title (उपाध्याय) or the context of bidding farewell, which is crucial for understanding the situation.
3. **Destination**: The machine translation omits the destination ""Jumla"" from the farewell statement.

Step 1: Identify the main subject and action
Source: आबाजीले कहरुकण सहित नौ अन्य दुर्गहरुमा अधिकार गर्न लिया ।
Main subject: आबाजी (Abaji)
Action: अधिकार गर्न लिया (took on control or rights)

Step 2: Compare the subject and action in the machine translation
Machine translation: Abaji taka to rights to nine other durgas, including the kings.
Subject: Abaji
Action: rights to nine other durgas (implies control or authority over them)

Step 3: Identify differences in detail
- In the source, ""कहरुकण सहित"" (including Kaharukan) is specified as one of the nine forts.
- The machine translation omits ""कहरुकण"" (Kaharukan) and instead mentions ""kings"" as part of the nine durgas, which is not accurate.

Step 4: Compare with the reference translation
Reference translation: Abaji took on control of nine other forts including Kaharukan.
- The reference translation correctly includes ""कहरुकण"" (Kaharukan) and uses the term ""control"" or ""took on"" (गर्न लिया) to convey the same meaning as the source.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in that it does not include ""कहरुकण"" (Kaharukan) and incorrectly mentions ""kings"" instead of forts. The reference translation more accurately captures the meaning of the source text.

|Machine translation: Paull has presented several ideas on the bureau of his subsidiary, including what the former proprietors of cedar.|
|Reference translation: Poudel has analyzed trends related to novels of Devkota and have presented his views in relation to Devkota 's novels.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject identification**: In the source, the subject is ""पौडेल"" (Poudel), but the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""Paull"". This is a significant difference.
2. **Action description**: The source states that Poudel ""केलाउँदै"" (has presented) ""उनका उपन्यसका बरेमा विभिन्न विचार"" (his views on the literary trends), while the machine translation incorrectly mentions ""presented several ideas on the bureau of his subsidiary"" and adds ""including what the former proprietors of cedar,"" which is not relevant to the context.
3. **Context**: The source specifically refers to ""देवकोटाका औपन्यासिक प्रवृत्तिहरू"" (literary trends of Devkota), while the machine translation omits this connection, making it unclear that the ideas are related to Devkota's novels.
4. **Grammar and structure**: The machine translation has incorrect word order and adds unnecessary details (cedar proprietors), which are not present in the reference translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of subject, context, and structure, leading to a lower quality translation. The machine translation fails to capture the essence of the source text, particularly the focus on Devkota's novels and the connection to literary trends.

|Analysis|
1. The source text is asking about a specific type of condition or disease related to the presence of other metal alloys in a person or something.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""अन्य धातुका रसानरूपी विकार"" (chemical alloys of other metals) as ""there is no other metallurgy in her,"" which is a literal translation that doesn't convey the intended meaning of the chemical composition.
3. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning by stating ""it contains chemical alloys of other metals,"" which implies the presence of those alloys rather than the absence of metallurgy.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation because it misunderstands the context and does not convey the idea of chemical composition. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

|Reference translation: The Newar community worship god and goddess and carry out Yagyahome in group at the time of drought, dry, and famine.|

|Analysis|
1. **Difference in deity name**: The machine translation refers to ""Jewshom,"" which is likely a mistranslation or a misunderstanding of the Nepali term ""Yagyahome."" The reference translation correctly mentions ""Yagyahome,"" which is a Nepali term for a type of ritual or ceremony.
2. **Omission of community**: The machine translation omits the reference to ""नेवार समुदायले"" (the Newar community), which is crucial for understanding the context.
3. **Structure and meaning**: The machine translation has a different structure and meaning, describing ""dry, drought, and famine"" as qualities of the worship, while the reference translation correctly places these conditions as the time when the rituals are performed.

Step 1: Identify key phrases and words in the source text
- प्रतिबन्धित क्षेत्रमा (restricted areas)
- पदयात्राको अनुमति (permission to travel/post)
- गृह मन्त्रालय (Ministry of Home Affairs)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: Permission of posts in the banned area must be taken from the home secretary.
- Reference translation: Permission to walk in restricted areas should be obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Step 3: Analyze differences
- The machine translation uses ""posts"" which is not present in the source text. It might be a misinterpretation or a generalization.
- The machine translation mentions ""home secretary"" while the reference translation uses ""Ministry of Home Affairs,"" which is the more appropriate authority for granting permissions in this context.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in two aspects:
1. It translates ""पदयात्राको अनुमति"" (permission to travel/post) as ""Permission of posts,"" which is not accurate as it implies a specific job-related permission rather than a general travel permission.
2. It refers to the ""home secretary"" instead of the ""Ministry of Home Affairs,"" which is the correct department for obtaining permission in the context of restricted areas.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should be revised to: ""Permission to travel in restricted areas should be obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs.""

Source: बोद्ध लामाले हातमा लिएर बजाउने घण्ट घोप्टो पारेर बजाउँछन् भने बोन्पोहरु त्यसलाई उत्तानो पारेर बजाउँछन् ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: If the bonpoles play in the hand, they play in the hand, and the bonpoles play in the hand.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The Buddhist Lamas play the bell folding it under, while the Bonpos play it keeping its face upward.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation seems to have a literal interpretation of the source text, which results in a less accurate translation. It translates ""घण्ट घोप्टो पारेर बजाउने"" (folding it under) as ""play in the hand"" and ""उत्तानो पारेर बजाउँछन्"" (keeping its face upward) as ""play in the hand"" without differentiating the actions for the two groups mentioned (Buddhist Lamas and Bonpos).
- The reference translation clearly distinguishes the actions and the direction of the bell being played, which is not captured in the machine translation.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation lacks context and differentiation, conflating the actions of the two groups.
- It does not convey the specific action of ""folding it under"" for the Buddhist Lamas and ""keeping its face upward"" for the Bonpos.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality due to its lack of nuance, context, and proper differentiation between the two groups mentioned. The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate representation of the source text.

- The machine translation states ""elaborate mental psychology in man"" while the reference translation says ""material luxuries add to the mental sufferings in humans."" The reference conveys the idea that material possessions can lead to mental distress, which is more consistent with the source.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the concepts conveyed. It incorrectly translates ""ईश्वरीय चिन्तन"" as ""Essential Cognition"" and introduces a concept of a synonymous physician, which is not present in the source.

|Reference translation: The people endured such atrocities for a year, looked forward and waited, but there was no change in it.|

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""यस्तो अत्याचार"" which means ""such atrocities"" in Nepali. The machine translation omits this context, translating it as ""And it came to pass"" without specifying the nature of the atrocities.
2. ""जनताले एक वर्ष खप्यो"" means ""the people had endured for a year"" in Nepali. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""when the people had drawn up a year,"" which doesn't convey the same meaning of enduring a period.
3. ""बाटो हे"" is a phrase that implies ""then"" or ""after that"" in Nepali, but the machine translation doesn't include this, making the connection between the events unclear.
4. ""तर त्यसमा कुनै परिवर्तन आएन"" means ""there was no change in it."" The machine translation accurately captures this part.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: But such a condition is found only in families that are very isolated from the Tamang society.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""very separate"" while the reference translation uses ""very isolated."" ""Separate"" implies a distinction or difference, whereas ""isolated"" suggests a lack of connection or communication, which might be more appropriate in the context of a social situation.

- The machine translation omits the word ""मात्र"" (only) from the source text. This word is important to convey the idea that the condition is exclusive to those families.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The main difference lies in the choice of words ""separate"" vs. ""isolated,"" which affects the meaning of the sentence.
- The word ""मात्र"" is missing in the machine translation, which changes the emphasis on the exclusivity of the condition.

| Machine translation: Babylonia's celebration of babylonia, also in front of the trade, was a trade runner in the far east of Asia.
| Reference translation: The Babylonian civilization, which was also at the forefront of trade, had trade even in the farthest countries of Asia.

Analysis:

1. **Difference in meaning**: The machine translation seems to interpret the source text as a celebration of Babylon itself, rather than focusing on the Babylonian civilization's trade activities. The reference translation correctly captures the context, which is about the civilization's trade.

2. **Incorrect word choice**: The phrase ""Babylonia's celebration of babylonia"" in the machine translation is redundant and does not make sense. The reference translation uses ""The Babylonian civilization"" which is more accurate.

3. **Misinterpretation of ""व्यापारमा पनि अगाडि""**: The machine translation translates this phrase as ""also in front of the trade,"" which is not a direct translation. The reference translation correctly renders it as ""which was also at the forefront of trade.""

4. **Placement of ""in the far east of Asia""**: The machine translation places this phrase after ""trade runner,"" which is not accurate. The reference translation places it after ""had trade even in the farthest countries of Asia,"" which better reflects the source's meaning.

Overall, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of meaning, word choice, and structure. The reference translation provides a more accurate and coherent representation of the source text.

|Source: भारत जैन धर्मको पुण्यभूमि र पितृभूमि छ किनभनें वर्तमान युगचक्रका चौबीसहरू तीर्थकंरोका गर्भ, जन्म, तप, कैवल्य एवं निर्वाण यहीं भए छन्।|
|Machine translation: India is deserted and deserted because the twenty-fourths of the current eugachy, the womb, the birth, the prison, and the making, are so.|
|Reference translation: India is the holy land and the fatherland of Jainism because the twenty-four Tirthakanro 's wombs, births, penances, caivalya, and Nirvana have taken place here.|

|Analysis|
1. **""भारत जैन धर्मको पुण्यभूमि र पितृभूमि""** (India is the holy land and the fatherland of Jainism) - Machine translation: ""India is deserted and deserted"" - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""पुण्यभूमि"" (holy land) and ""पितृभूमि"" (fatherland) as ""deserted"", which is not accurate.
2. **""वर्तमान युगचक्रका चौबीसहरू""** (the twenty-four Tirthankaras) - Machine translation: ""the twenty-fourths of the current eugachy"" - The machine translation mistranslates ""तीर्थकंरो"" (Tirthankaras) as ""eugachy"", which is a misunderstanding of the term. The correct translation should be ""Tirthankaras"" or ""the lineage of Tirthankaras.""
3. **""गर्भ, जन्म, तप, कैवल्य, एवं निर्वाण""** (womb, birth, penance, caivalya, and Nirvana) - Machine translation: ""the womb, the birth, the prison, and the making"" - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""तप"" (penance) as ""prison"" and ""कैवल्य"" (caivalya) as ""the making"", which are not accurate. The correct translation should be ""penance"" and ""caivalya"" respectively.

In summary, the machine translation fails to accurately convey the meaning of the source text, particularly in terms of religious and cultural context, and the specific terms related to Jainism. The reference translation provides a more faithful representation of the original text.

|Reference translation: Ravana prepared his army and sent it to fight with Rama 's army but Rama 's army killed all Ravana 's army.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject and verb difference**: In the source, ""रावणले"" (Rāvanle) is the subject and ""तयार गरेर"" (tayāra garer) is the verb, indicating Ravana's action. The machine translation incorrectly uses ""Raan"" as the subject, which is a different name and does not convey the original meaning.
2. **Preparation of the army**: The source mentions ""तयार गरेर"" (prepared), but the machine translation omits this part, making it unclear that Ravana's army was prepared before the fight.
3. **Action of the armies**: The source states that Rāvan's army was ""laid to waste"" or ""marched to attack"" (लड्न पठायो), while the machine translation simplifies it to ""slew all of Raam's army."" The reference translation correctly captures the meaning as ""killed all Ravana's army.""
4. **Punctuation and capitalization**: The machine translation capitalizes ""Raan"" and ""Raa'm"" which is not accurate in the Nepali context, and it omits the appropriate punctuation.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of subject, the preparation of the army, and the description of the battle outcome. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuances of the original Nepali text.

|Reference translation: Even if you don 't find anything special that reflects your own original language and culture, all the festivals celebrated in Nepali society are their main festivals.|
|Analysis:|
1. **Difference in emphasis**: The machine translation emphasizes that there is ""nothing to do with your own language and culture,"" which might imply a lack of relevance. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses ""don't find anything special"" to express the same idea but with a more neutral tone, focusing on the lack of personal connection rather than a complete absence.
2. **Omission of ""main festivals""**: The machine translation omits the phrase ""their main festivals"" from the source, which is crucial for conveying the significance of these events in Nepalese society.
3. **Word order and structure**: The machine translation rephrases the sentence structure, which results in a less natural and accurate translation. The reference translation maintains a closer alignment with the original source.

Overall, the machine translation loses some nuance and accuracy in conveying the meaning, particularly in the context of the festivals being the main ones for the Nepalese society. The reference translation better captures the essence of the source text.

|Reference translation: Varnashrama religion has disappeared there and Brahmins are living a miserable life.|

Analysis:
1. The source text is about the Varnashrama religion and its impact on the lives of Brahmins.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""वर्णाश्रम धर्म"" (Varnashrama religion) as ""the alphabet has been looped,"" which is a literal and unrelated interpretation.
3. The phrase ""लोप भएको छ"" (disappeared) is not translated accurately, as it is translated as ""has been looped"" in the machine translation, which does not convey the disappearance.
4. The reference translation correctly conveys the idea that the religion has vanished and the Brahmins are living a difficult life, using the term ""miserable life"" (दयनीय जीवन) to describe their condition.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the source text, failing to capture the meaning related to the Varnashrama religion and the state of the Brahmin community.

|Machine translation: The other two goals in the choice phase were scored by India and Bangladesh vs. Mira Thapa.|
|Reference translation: The other two goals in the qualifying round were scored by Mira Thapa against India and Bangladesh.|

|Analysis|
1. **Source meaning**: The sentence talks about two goals scored in a specific phase (छनोट चरणमा) where Mira Thapa scored against India and Bangladesh.
2. **Machine translation difference**: The machine translation incorrectly states that the goals were scored ""by India and Bangladesh vs. Mira Thapa,"" which suggests a competition between the two countries rather than Mira Thapa scoring against them. The correct phrasing should be ""by Mira Thapa against India and Bangladesh.""
3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning that Mira Thapa scored the goals, and the context of the opposing teams (India and Bangladesh) is clear.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation because it incorrectly attributes the goals to a competition between India and Bangladesh instead of specifying that Mira Thapa scored them against these teams.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: ""९ नोभेम्बरमा ट्रिपल एचले रोमन रेन्जलाई अथुरिटिमा सम्लग्न हुन अहावान गरेका थिए"" (On 9 November, Triple H had been unhappy to attach the Roman range to athurias)
- Machine translation: ""On 9 November, triple h had been unhappy to attach the Roman range to athurias but the proposal was rejected by the range.""

The machine translation captures the main idea that Triple H was unhappy about attaching the Roman range to something (presumably athurias) and that the range rejected a proposal. However, the source text uses ""अथुरियामा"" (to athurias), which is a possessive form, suggesting a connection to athurias, while the machine translation omits this possessive aspect.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""On 9 November, triple h had been unhappy to attach the Roman range to athurias but the proposal was rejected by the range.""
- Reference translation: ""On November 9, Triple H had called on the Roman Range to join the Authority, but Range had rejected such an offer.""

The reference translation correctly translates the possessive aspect as ""the Roman Range"" (Roman Range) and ""to join the Authority"" (सम्लग्न हुन अहावान गरेका) instead of ""to attach to athurias."" It also uses ""called on"" (called on) which implies an invitation or request, which is more suitable than the machine translation's ""unhappy"" (अहावान) which suggests a negative emotion.

Conclusion:
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
1. It omits the possessive aspect ""to athurias"" in the phrase ""to attach.""
2. It uses ""unhappy"" (अहावान) which implies a negative emotion, while the reference translation uses ""called on"" (called on) which suggests a request or invitation.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should include the possessive aspect and use a term that indicates a request or invitation, like ""called on"" or ""invited.""

|Machine translation: The Earl of Hanuman, the king of the gurkhas, had set up an image of Hanuman in front of his palace.|
|Reference translation: Prithvipati Shah , the king of the Gorkha , had set up an statue of Hanuman in front of his palace.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""गोरखाका राजा पृथ्वीपति शाह"" (Gorakhāka Rāja Pṛthvīpāti Shah), which refers to the king of Gorkha, not ""the Earl of Hanuman"" as in the machine translation. The machine translation incorrectly identifies the subject as the Earl of Hanuman, which is a different historical figure.
2. The reference translation correctly uses ""the king of the Gorkha"" (the Gorkha king), while the machine translation omits the word ""Gorkha"" and refers to the king as belonging to the Gurkhas, which is a different ethnic group.
3. The word ""मूर्ति"" (murti) in the source means ""statue"" or ""image,"" which is translated as ""an image"" in the machine translation. However, the reference translation uses ""an statue,"" which is a correct translation but with a minor grammatical error.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the incorrect identification of the subject (Prithvipati Shah instead of the Earl of Hanuman) and the reference to the Gorkha kingdom instead of the Gurkhas. Additionally, there is a minor grammatical error in the reference translation.

|im_start| Analyzing the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. **Source text**: The source text mentions ""देशका बिभिन्न भागमा"" (different parts of the country) and ""खुल्न सुरु"" (started opening) in the context of schools opening alongside ""हाइस्कूलको सुरुवात"" (the start of hyskool).

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""देशका बिभिन्न भागमा"" as ""several parts of the country"" and ""खुल्न सुरु"" as ""started to open with the start of hyskool."" It combines the two events (school opening and hyskool start) into one phrase, which is not accurate.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation correctly separates the two events, stating ""some schools in different parts of the country started opening at the same time as Durbar High School."" It specifies that the schools opened simultaneously with Durbar High School, which is a clearer and more precise translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation loses the nuance of the source text by conflating the school opening with the start of hyskool, while the reference translation maintains the distinction and provides a more accurate representation of the original meaning. The machine translation could be improved by acknowledging the separate timing of the events and specifying a reference point like Durbar High School.

|Source: श्रम गरेर पनि श्रमिक भनिएनन्, साहित्य लेखेर साहित्यकारमा दरिएनन्।|
|Machine translation: The serial was not even called by labour, and was not rated in literature by literature.|
|Reference translation: They were not called labourer even after the labour and were not called writer even after writing literature.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference in verb conjugation**: The source text uses the verb ""भनिएनन्"" (to call) in the context of being addressed as a laborer, which is a second-person imperative form in Nepali. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""called by"" (past tense) in English, losing the imperative aspect and the direct address.

2. **Lack of subject agreement**: In the source, ""पनि"" (even) is used to emphasize that the laborer was not called by name even after doing the work. The machine translation omits this word, making the sentence structure unclear.

3. **Word order and structure**: The source sentence structure is more direct and clear, with the two actions (not being called laborer and not being called a writer) presented consecutively. The machine translation combines these into a single sentence, which is less natural and loses the parallelism.

4. **Translation of ""दरिएनन्"":** The source uses ""दरिएनन्"" which could mean ""was not rated"" or ""was not acknowledged"" in the context of literary recognition. The machine translation translates this as ""rated in literature by literature,"" which is awkward and does not convey the intended meaning.

5. **Omission of ""after"":** The reference translation includes ""after"" to indicate the sequence of events, which is not present in the machine translation.

In summary, the machine translation has issues with verb conjugation, subject agreement, sentence structure, and word choice, leading to a less accurate and natural translation compared to the reference.

|Reference translation: The reason for this is the emotional relation between the breastfeeding mother and her baby is very strong.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""स्तनपान गराउने"" (breastfeeding), which is not translated accurately as ""her teacher"" in the machine translation. Instead, it should be translated as ""breastfeeding mother"" or ""पानीपानी"" (feeding on milk) to maintain context.
2. The machine translation refers to a ""divine relationship,"" which is not present in the source text. The source talks about an ""भावनात्मक सम्बन्ध"" (emotional connection), which is a more appropriate term for the context.
3. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of ""मजबुत"" (strong) to describe the emotional bond between the mother and baby, which is missing in the machine translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation by misinterpreting the term ""स्तनपान"" and introducing a concept of a divine relationship that is not present in the source text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: A government proposed middle school in the village is shivamai prefecture.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: A government proposed secondary school in the village, Shivamai Pra.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the source text
- The source text mentions a ""गाउँमा एउटा सरकारी प्रस्तावित माध्यमिक विद्यालय"" (a government-proposed middle school) and ""शिवमाई प्र"" (Shivamai, likely a name or abbreviation).
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""माध्यमिक विद्यालय"" (middle school) as ""middle school"" without specifying that it's a secondary school, which is more accurate in the Nepali context.
- It also adds the phrase ""is shivamai prefecture"" which is not found in the source or reference translation. Prefecture is not a common term for a school in Nepal.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation omits the word ""secondary"" which is crucial for clarity in the context of Nepali education levels.
- The reference translation correctly separates ""Shivamai"" from ""Pra"" as ""Shivamai Pra,"" likely indicating a name or a term related to the school.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, specifically in the level of the school (middle vs. secondary) and the addition of the ""is shivamai prefecture"" phrase, which is not supported by the source text.

|Machine translation: Particularly, Mela is the custom of playing patience during jubilee and worship texts.|
|Reference translation: Especially during fairs , festivals and poojas , there is a practice of playing Dhamari.|

Analysis:

1. **Difference in context**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""मेला"" (mela) as ""jubilee"" or ""festivals,"" which is not specific enough. The reference translation correctly identifies it as ""fairs"" (मेल), which is a more common and accurate term for this context in Nepal.

2. **Misinterpretation of ""पाठका बेला""**: The machine translation translates this phrase as ""playing patience,"" which is a literal but incorrect interpretation. ""पाठका बेला"" refers to a traditional folk game, specifically ""Dhamari,"" which is a type of musical game. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""playing Dhamari.""

3. **Lack of emphasis**: The machine translation does not convey the emphasis on the practice (प्रचलन छ) as the reference translation does. The reference translation uses ""there is a practice of"" to emphasize the commonality of the activity.

4. **Sentence structure**: The machine translation has a slightly awkward sentence structure, with ""playing patience"" following ""custom of,"" which is less natural than the reference translation's structure.

|im_start|
Step 1: Identify the key elements in the source text.
- Year: २०५९ (2059)
- Event: माओवादीले बनाएको जनमुक्ति सेनाको (Maoists formed the people's army)
- Position: ब्रिगेड कमान्डर (brigade commander)
- Person: पनि उहाँ (Pani Uha)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Machine translation:
- Year: 2059
- Event: Brigade Commander of the people's army formed by the maoists
- Position: Brigade Commander
- Person: Not mentioned (unnecessary in this context)

Reference translation:
- Year: 2059 BS (2002 AD) (additional information about the calendar)
- Event: Brigade Commander of the People's Liberation Army (slightly different phrasing, but still conveys the same meaning)
- Position: Brigade Commander
- Person: Not mentioned (unnecessary in this context)

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation omits the Nepali calendar (2059 BS) which is important for context, especially when translating to a non-Nepali-speaking audience. It assumes the year 2059 is universally understood.
- The reference translation specifies ""People's Liberation Army"" instead of just ""people's army,"" which provides more clarity about the nature of the army.
- The reference translation adds the Nepali calendar to the year, making it clear that it refers to 2002 AD.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not include the Nepali calendar and uses a slightly less specific term for the army. The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation by including the calendar and specifying ""People's Liberation Army.""

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: हाम्रो समाजमा अन्धविश्वास व्याप्त भएकाले सर्पले टोकेमा यस्ता कार्य गर्नुहुँदैन

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: That such action should not be done in the serpent token because of the blind interests in our society

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: As superstition is prevalent in our society, one should not do these types of things if a snake bites.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation mentions ""serpent token"" (सर्पले टोकेमा), which is not a common phrase in the Nepali context. It seems to be a literal translation of ""snake"" (सर्प) and ""token"" (टोकेमा), which might be a mistranslation or a cultural reference that is not clear.
- The machine translation uses ""blind interests"" (अन्धविश्वास), which is a direct translation of ""अन्धविश्वास"" (superstition), but it is not as clear as the reference's ""superstition is prevalent"" (सुपरस्टिशन व्याप्त) in conveying the idea of widespread belief.
- The reference translation connects the situation to ""if a snake bites"" (यदि सर्प चुर्के), while the machine translation does not explicitly mention this context.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its choice of words and the context. It could benefit from a more nuanced translation that captures the idea of superstition and the specific action being discouraged in response to a snake bite, rather than focusing on a literal translation of ""serpent token."" The reference translation is clearer and more culturally appropriate.

|Source: ख्याली गीतमा पैंसा झार्ने, टिपाउने र रकम दिने मान्छेलाई गीतैबाट धन्यवाद दिने गरिन्छ ।|
|Machine translation: In the palm song, the money is dropped, tipped and rocked thanks to a man from the song.|
|Reference translation: In the Khyali song, people who drop money, collect money, and give money are thanked from the song.|

**Analysis:**

1. **""ख्याली गीतमा""** (Khyali song) - The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""palm song,"" which is a literal translation of ""पैंसा झार्ने"" (pansa xharne), but it should be referring to a specific type of song, like the Khyali genre.
2. **""पैंसा झार्ने""** (drop money) - The machine translation translates this as ""the money is dropped,"" which is accurate but loses the context of the action being performed in the song.
3. **""टिपाउने""** (collect money) - The machine translation omits this part, which is crucial for understanding the action being thanked for.
4. **""रकम दिने""** (give money) - The machine translation does not include this part, which is also an important action mentioned in the source.
5. **""मान्छेलाई""** (to the people) - The machine translation does not convey the recipient of the thanks, which is implied in the source.

**Conclusion:**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Identify the main components of the source text
- Subject: मण्डेलालाई (Mandela's)
- Action: स्वतन्त्र गराउने आवाजका रुपमा (as a voice to free)
- Time: स्थानीय तथा अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय (local and international)
- Result: दवाबहरु पनि बढ्न थाले (grew)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: At various times as a voice to free the assembly, local and international forces also grew.
- Reference translation: At various times, local and international pressures began to mount in the form of voices calling for Mandela's release.

Step 3: Analyze differences
- The machine translation omits the possessive form ""मण्डेलालाई"" (Mandela's) which is important to clarify whose voice is being referred to.
- The machine translation uses ""forces"" instead of ""pressures"" which changes the meaning slightly, as ""pressures"" better conveys the sense of mounting demands.
- The machine translation does not mention the ""release"" explicitly, which is a key part of the context.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of clarity, specificity, and the focus on the call for release. The reference translation provides a more accurate representation of the source text's meaning.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: यसबाहेक ब्राह्मणद्वारा पूजाआजा गराउने पनि पाइन्छन् ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: It is also found to be worshipped by bravery, except that it is not worshipped by bravery.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Except this , worship is also done by Brahmins .

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the source text
- The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the context, as it mentions ""worshipped by bravery"" which is not directly present in the source text. The source text talks about Brahmins (ब्राह्मणद्वारा) performing the worship (पूजाआजा गराउने) but does not specify the act of bravery.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation omits the word ""यसबाहेक"" (except this) which is crucial to convey the contrast in the reference translation.
- It also incorrectly states that the thing is ""not worshipped by bravery,"" which is not the case according to the source.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of context and the exclusion of important phrases. The reference translation accurately conveys that Brahmins perform the worship, while the machine translation incorrectly associates bravery with the act of worship and misses the contrast implied by ""यसबाहेक"".

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: यस्तै हाल हरिनास गाउँपालिकाको सम्पूर्ण वडा तथा केन्द्रमा समेत यस सालडाँडा गाउँ यातायातको सहायताले जोडिन पुगेको छ ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Similarly, the whole of harinas village and the center of this salad village are connected with the help of transportation.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Likewise , now all wards and centers of Harinas Village Municipality has also been connected with the help of this Saaldanda Gaau Yatayat .

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""salad village"" which is not accurate, as it seems to be a literal translation of ""सालडाँडा गाउँ"" (Saaldanda Gaau), which might be a name or a term specific to the context, not a type of village.
- The machine translation omits the word ""हाल"" (now), which is important for understanding the timing of the connection.
- The machine translation uses ""are connected"" instead of ""has been connected"" in the reference translation, which changes the tense and implies a continuous action rather than a completed one.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the interpretation of ""सालडाँडा गाउँ"" (Salad village), the inclusion of the word ""हाल"" (now), and the tense used for the connection. The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation.

|Source: अब म के गरौ वा मैले के गर्नु उचित हुन्छ, म कुनै बेला पनि भोक सहन सक्दिन।|
|Machine translation: Now what do I do, or what do I do? I can't be hungry at any time.|
|Reference translation: What should I do now or what will be reasonable to do for me, I can never bear the hunger.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Sentence structure**: The source sentence has a more complex structure, combining two questions (""अब म के गरौ वा मैले के गर्नु"" means ""now what should I do or what"") and a statement about the inability to bear hunger (""म कुनै बेला पनि भोक सहन सक्दिन"" means ""I can never bear the hunger""). The machine translation simplifies this by combining the questions into a single statement and losing the nuance of the original structure.

2. **Meaning**: The machine translation misses the context of the speaker's struggle with hunger, which is a key aspect of the original sentence. The reference translation captures this by translating ""म कुनै बेला पनि भोक सहन सक्दिन"" as ""I can never bear the hunger,"" emphasizing the emotional aspect.

3. **Translation accuracy**: The machine translation does not convey the intended meaning as accurately as the reference translation. It changes the sentence structure and loses the emphasis on the speaker's inability to endure hunger.

|Reference translation: Hetauda, located on the eastern edge of the Chitwan Valley, is a major industrial and commercial city of Nepal.|

Analysis:
1. The source text is about Hetauda's location and its significance as an industrial and commercial city in Nepal, not an obituary.
2. The machine translation incorrectly interprets ""पूर्वी छेउमा"" (eastern side) as ""Obituary,"" which is a misunderstanding of the context.
3. The machine translation also mentions ""principal ethnic,"" which is not present in the source or reference translations, and might be an unnecessary addition or a misinterpretation.
4. The reference translation correctly translates ""प्रमुख औधोगीक"" (major industrial) and ""वाणीज्य शहर"" (commercial city), and specifies that Hetauda is located on the ""eastern edge"" of the Chitwan Valley.

Overall, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of context, misinterpreting the source's description of Hetauda's location and role as a city, and including unnecessary details. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original meaning.

|Reference translation: The celebration of Krishna Ashtami is considered to be the occasion celebrated by all the people of Gokul in the excitement of the birth of a beautiful child in the house of Nandaraya of Gokul.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject and context**: The source text mentions ""उतसाहमा"" (in excitement), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation captures this excitement, while the machine translation omits it.
2. **House and owner**: The source specifies ""नन्दरायको घरमा"" (Nandaraya's house), but the machine translation omits this detail, referring to ""gokulka nandarayana"" instead. The reference translation correctly includes the house owner's name.
3. **Celebration**: The source states that the ""गोकुलवासी सम्पूर्णले"" (all the Gokul residents) celebrate the occasion, while the machine translation implies that the entire ""gokulka"" is a festival of mercy, which is a different meaning.

|Machine translation: That same season, the same was halted by the beach hand, and the security forces of WWII separated the two by aid there.|
|Reference translation: During this course there was a fight between them and WWE security officials had to separate them by going there.|

Analysis:
1. **""त्यसै क्रममा""** (During this course) - Machine translation: ""That same season"" - The source text refers to a sequence or progression, while the machine translation incorrectly assumes it's about a specific season.
2. **""उनिहरू बिच हात""** (between them on the beach) - Machine translation: ""the beach hand"" - The source text implies a conflict between two parties, not a physical beach hand.
3. **""भएको थियोे""** (had happened) - Machine translation: ""halted"" - The source text suggests an event occurred, not a halting action.
4. **""डब्ल्युडब्ल्युआईका सुरक्षा दल""** (WWE security forces) - Machine translation: ""the security forces of WWII"" - The source text specifically mentions WWE, not World War II.
5. **""अाएर""** (there) - Machine translation: ""by aid"" - The source text uses ""there"" to indicate the location of the separation, not assistance.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the context, specifically regarding the sequence of events, the parties involved, and the association with WWE instead of WWII. The translation also incorrectly interprets the action ""भएको थियोे"" as ""halted"" instead of an event.

2. **""उनले""** (he did) - The machine translation correctly uses ""he visited"" to represent ""उनले भ्रमण गरेका थिए,"" but the verb tense is not adjusted to match the past tense in the reference translation.
3. **""भारतका""** (India's) - Both translations include ""in India,"" which is accurate.

|Reference translation: One week before that challenge, Triple-H had attacked Semus as a result of which Semus was injured and he had to stay for treatment for 10 months.|
|Analysis:|
1. **Time difference**: The machine translation incorrectly states ""one week ahead of that challenge"" while the reference translation says ""one week before that challenge."" The correct time frame is ""before"" rather than ""ahead of.""
2. **Action**: The machine translation incorrectly implies that Triple H defeated Seamus with the intention of him committing suicide, whereas the reference translation simply states that Triple H attacked Seamus, which is a more neutral action.
3. **Reason for staying**: The machine translation mentions ""due to seamus wounding"" and the idea of suicide, which is not present in the reference translation. The reference only states that Seamus was injured and needed treatment, not the reason for the injury or any suicidal intentions.
4. **Treatment duration**: Both translations mention the 10-month period, but the context is different. The machine translation suggests a suicidal motive, while the reference simply describes the need for treatment.

In summary, the machine translation deviates from the reference in terms of the timing, the nature of the event (attack vs. suicide), and the context of Seamus needing treatment. The reference translation is clearer and more faithful to the original Nepali text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Published sources include books, bibliographies, books, percussion, paimphlets, etc.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The published resources include books , texts , pamphlets , etc .

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation has ""books, bibliographies, books"" which is a repetition and incorrect, as the source text only mentions ""पुस्तक"" (books) once.
- ""Percussion"" in the machine translation is a mistranslation, as it is a musical term and does not fit the context of the source text, which is about publications.
- ""Paimphlets"" is a typo in the machine translation, it should be ""पैम्फलेट"" (pamphlets) as in the source.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation omits ""ग्रन्थ"" (texts) and includes an incorrect term ""percussion"" and a typo ""paimphlets"" instead of ""पैम्फलेट"" (pamphlets).
- The structure of the sentence is slightly different, with the reference translation using ""include"" followed by a list, while the machine translation combines them.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality due to the repetition of ""books"", incorrect inclusion of ""percussion"", and a typo in ""paimphlets"". It would be more accurate to translate as ""The published resources include books, texts, and pamphlets, etc.""

Machine translation: So all the scenes were turning into the growth of Nepal.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Therefore, everyone's eyes were on the prosperity of Nepal Mandal.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""turning into"" (which implies a transformation), while the reference translation uses ""were on"" (which implies focus or attention).
- The source text mentions ""सबैको दृष्टि"" (everyone's eyes), which is accurately translated as ""everyone's eyes"" in the reference translation.
- The machine translation omits ""नेपालमण्डलको"" (Nepal Mandal's), which is a possessive form indicating the focus is on the prosperity of the specific region, Nepal Mandal. The reference translation includes this detail.
- The machine translation uses ""growth of Nepal"" instead of ""prosperity of Nepal Mandal,"" which is a more specific and accurate reference to the context, as it refers to the prosperity of the entire region, not just the country.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the focus on the specific region (Nepal Mandal) and the choice of words that convey the attention being on prosperity rather than transformation.

- खास गरी (particularly)
- औषधीको वर्णन (description of the drug)

Step 3: Read the reference translation

- Machine translation: ""not interrupted"" - The reference translation uses ""did not stop,"" which conveys the same meaning but with a slightly different emphasis.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation captures the main idea but loses some nuance in the description of the challenges faced during the scientific research journey. The reference translation provides a more accurate and detailed representation of the source text by including ""ups and downs"" and maintaining the emphasis on the continuity of the journey despite these challenges.

|Source: पञ्चायती शासनकालको अन्धकारमय समयमा शासकहरू मस्ती लुटिरहेका थिए भने जनता अबुझ खसीबोकाझैँ डोहोरिरहन्थे।|
|Machine translation: During the darkness of the fifty reigns, the rulers were spoiling the slain, and the people were robbed of Abuzh Khashiboka.|
|Reference translation: In the dark days of the Panchayat rule, the rulers were enjoying all privileges while the people were guided like ignorant goats.|

Analysis:

1. **Timeframe**: The machine translation refers to ""fifty reigns"" (पञ्चायती शासनकालको अन्धकारमय समयमा), which might be a literal translation of ""the darkness of the fifty reigns"" but does not convey the metaphorical sense of ""dark days"" as in the reference translation. The reference uses ""dark days"" to describe the era, which is more appropriate.

2. **Ruler's actions**: The machine translation states that the rulers were ""spoil[ing] the slain"" (मस्ती लुटिरहेका थिए), which could be a literal interpretation of the source's ""mashti lutiraha"" (enjoying). The reference, however, says they were ""enjoying all privileges"" (लाभ लान्छन्), which is a broader and more nuanced description.

3. **People's situation**: The machine translation mentions that the people were ""robbed of Abuzh Khashiboka"" (अबुझ खसीबोकाझैँ डोहोरिरहन्थे), which is a direct translation of the source's phrase. The reference, on the other hand, compares the people to ""ignorant goats"" (गोरिल्लों जैसे निर्देशित), which implies a lack of agency and control, rather than a specific robbery.

In summary, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the timeframe, the description of the rulers' actions, and the metaphorical representation of the people's situation. The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more effectively by using idiomatic expressions and a more nuanced portrayal of the events.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: त्यसैले खनालको विचारमा आंशिक सत्यता रहे पनि पूर्ण सत्यको निरूपणता पाइन्न ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Therefore there is no partial truth in the opinion of diggers, neither is there any partial truth in the opinion of perfection.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Therefore , in Khanal 's view , even if there is partial truth , there is representation of no absolute truth .

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""there is no partial truth in the opinion of diggers"" and ""there is no partial truth in the opinion of perfection,"" which implies a complete absence of partial truth in both cases.
- The reference translation, on the other hand, says ""even if there is partial truth,"" suggesting that Khanal's view acknowledges the possibility of partial truth but emphasizes the lack of absolute truth.

Difference analysis:
- The machine translation is more absolute, denying any partial truth in both opinions, while the reference translation allows for the possibility of partial truth in one opinion (Khanal's view) but still emphasizes the absence of absolute truth.
- The reference translation also adds the context of Khanal's view, which is missing in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the presence or absence of partial truth, as well as in the attribution of Khanal's perspective. The reference translation provides a nuanced understanding, acknowledging the potential for partial truth in one opinion while emphasizing the lack of absolute truth, whereas the machine translation presents a more definitive and absolute stance.

|Source: यस नक्षत्रका अधिदेवता इन्द्र र अग्नि हुन् भने यस नक्षत्रको स्वामी ग्रह गुरु बृहस्पति हुन्।|
|Machine translation: While the overwhelming moon and Agnes of this nervous planet are Jupiter, the owner of this nervous planet is Jupiter.|
|Reference translation: The deities of this constellation are Indra and Agni and the lord of this constellation is Guru Brihaspati.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Translation of deities**: The source mentions ""अधिदेवता इन्द्र र अग्नि"" (deities Indra and Agni), which is translated to ""the overwhelming moon and Agnes"" in the machine translation. This is a misinterpretation, as ""अधिदेवता"" refers to deities, not the moon, and ""अग्नि"" is Agni, not a name for the moon. The correct translation should be ""the deities Indra and Agni.""

2. **Translation of planet's owner**: The source states ""यस नक्षत्रको स्वामी ग्रह"" (the lord of this constellation), which is translated to ""the owner of this nervous planet"" in the machine translation. Here, the term ""स्वामी ग्रह"" refers to the lord or master of the constellation, not the owner of a nervous planet. The correct translation should be ""the lord of this constellation.""

3. **Translation of the name of the lord**: The source mentions ""गुरु बृहस्पति"" (Guru Brihaspati), which is not translated accurately in the machine translation. It should be translated as ""Guru Brihaspati"" without any change, as it is a proper noun referring to a specific deity.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in the interpretation of deities, the role of the planet, and the proper name of the lord. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the meaning of the source text.

|Source: कविताको यस्तो आयाममा जीवन जगतको सिङ्गो प्रस्तुति, खण्डयोजना, सन्धि, अर्थ प्रकृति र कार्यावस्था जस्ता प्राविधिक कुराको संयोजन गरिएको हुन्छ ।|
|Machine translation: In this dimension of the book, life is combined with technical things such as horn presentation, segmentation, aggregation, meaning nature and office.|
|Reference translation: In such a dimension of poetry, the whole presentation of the world of life, segmentation, treaty, nature, and working condition are combined.|

|Analysis|
1. **""कविताको"" vs ""the book""**: The source text refers to ""कविताको"" (of poetry), while the machine translation generalizes it to ""the book"". The reference translation correctly keeps the context of poetry.
2. **""सिङ्गो प्रस्तुति"" vs ""horn presentation""**: The source text does not mention ""horn presentation"" but refers to a broader concept of ""whole presentation"" or ""singing presentation"" (सिङ्गो प्रस्तुति). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as a technical term.
3. **""खण्डयोजना"" vs ""segmentation""**: The machine translation accurately captures this term as ""segmentation.""
4. **""सन्धि"" vs ""aggregation""**: The source text uses ""सन्धि"" (treaty or agreement), which is a more general term than ""aggregation."" The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""aggregation.""
5. **""अर्थ प्रकृति"" vs ""meaning nature""**: The source text refers to ""अर्थ प्रकृति"" (nature of meaning), which is a more specific concept than ""meaning nature."" The machine translation loses some nuance here.
6. **""कार्यावस्था"" vs ""working condition""**: The machine translation correctly translates this as ""working condition.""

In summary, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of context (poetry vs. book), specific terms (singing presentation, treaty), and nuance (meaning nature). The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: जीवनका प्रारम्भिक दिन र जीवनका अन्तिम दिनका घटनाहरूमा पनि समानता पाइन्छ ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Equivalent to the early days of life and the last days of life events are also found.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Similarity in early days of life and the last days of life events are also found.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""Equivalent to"" which is a direct translation but might not convey the same nuance as the reference's ""समानता"" (similarity).
- The machine translation omits the word ""पाइन्छ"" (found) at the end, which is present in the reference translation.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation is more literal and might not capture the cultural or idiomatic aspect of the phrase, as ""equivalent to"" might not convey the idea of a common experience or observation.
- The reference translation uses ""are also found"" which implies a common occurrence, while the machine translation might not convey this sense of prevalence.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the choice of words and the nuance it conveys. The reference translation better captures the idea of similarity being a common experience in both the early and final days of life.

|Source: सूरत त्यस समय पश्चिमी व्यापारिहरुको  गढ थियो र हिन्दुस्तानी मुसलमानहरुका लागि हजमा जाने  द्वार ।|
|Machine translation: Surat was at that time the governor of western merchants and the gate to Haze for the hindustani museums.|
|Reference translation: Surat at that time was the fort of Western merchants and a gateway for Hajj for Indian Muslims.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""सूरत त्यस समय पश्चिमी व्यापारिहरुको गढ"" (Surat at that time was the fort of Western merchants), which is translated to ""the governor of western merchants"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""the fort of Western merchants.""
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""हिन्दुस्तानी मुसलमानहरुका लागि हजमा जाने द्वार"" (gate for the Hajj for Indian Muslims) as ""the gate to Haze for the hindustani museums."" The reference translation correctly translates this as ""a gateway for Hajj for Indian Muslims.""
3. The word ""हजमा"" (Hajj) is not translated accurately in the machine translation, which might be a mistranslation or a misunderstanding of the context.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""governor"" and ""Hajj,"" and it incorrectly translates ""हजमा जाने द्वार"" as a gate to Haze instead of a gateway for the religious pilgrimage of Hajj. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the source text.

|Machine translation: In the temples of the gods in west Nepal, and in the religious festivals of Dharma, Jhoda, Chutkila, Adi, and Gatha.|
|Reference translation: In western Nepal , it is customary to sing the songs of gods like Dhamari , Jhoda , Chutkila etc. in the temples of gods and in religious festivals .|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""देवताका मन्दिरहरूमा"" (in the temples of the gods) and ""धार्मिक उत्सवहरूमा"" (in religious festivals), which refers to the context where certain activities take place.
2. The machine translation correctly translates ""देवताका मन्दिरहरूमा"" as ""in the temples of the gods"" but combines ""धार्मिक उत्सवहरूमा"" into ""and in the religious festivals of Dharma, Jhoda, Chutkila, Adi, and Gatha,"" which is a list of specific activities rather than the general context of religious festivals.
3. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning by saying ""it is customary to sing"" (छ ।) and specifies the songs (like Dhamari, Jhoda, Chutkila) and the locations (temples of gods and religious festivals).

The main difference is that the machine translation incorrectly assumes that Dharma, Jhoda, Chutkila, and Adi are specific religious festivals rather than types of songs, which leads to a less accurate representation of the source text. The reference translation maintains the correct context and meaning.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: उद्देश्य विभिन्न कोणबाट यस काव्यको विश्लेषण गर्नु र योगी नरहरिनाथलाई एउटा

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Analyze this uncertainty from the objective differential angle and the contribution not to the contribution angle.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Analyze the poetry from various angles and one for Yogi Naraharinath.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The source text talks about ""विभिन्न कोणबाट"" (various angles) and ""योगी नरहरिनाथलाई"" (for Yogi Naraharinath), which refers to analyzing a poem from different perspectives and specifically for that Yogi.
- The machine translation, however, has a misunderstanding of the phrase ""विभिन्न कोणबाट"" and translates it as ""objective differential angle,"" which is not a direct or accurate translation. It also incorrectly mentions ""the contribution not to the contribution angle,"" which does not make sense in the context.
- The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of the source text, focusing on analyzing the poetry and specifying the Yogi.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. It misinterprets the phrase ""विभिन्न कोणबाट"" and introduces an unrelated concept of ""objective differential angle."" Additionally, it omits the specific reference to Yogi Naraharinath. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

|Machine translation: Therefore the goddess of the roots was God with Mr. Percy.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""त्यसकारण"" (therefore) and ""जरासंधको भगवान श्री कृष्णसंग"" (Jarasandh's enmity towards Lord Krishna).
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""भगवान श्री कृष्णसंग"" as ""God with Mr. Percy,"" which is a misinterpretation of the context, as it implies a deity associated with a person named Percy, rather than the enmity towards Lord Krishna.
3. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning by translating ""भगवान श्री कृष्णसंग"" as ""had great enmity to Shree Krishna.""

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is of lower quality because it fails to understand the context and the relationship between Jarasandh and Lord Krishna, instead interpreting it as a deity being associated with someone else. The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning from the source text.

|Machine translation: After a few weeks of that event, sun micross also returned to WWE and he joined the ufu on the nu wild odor team.|
|Reference translation: A few weeks after that incident, Sun Michaels returned to the WWE and included himself in the New World Order group.|

|Analysis|
1. **""त्यस घटनाको""** (That event's) - Machine translation: ""After a few weeks of that event""
   Difference: The source uses ""घटनाको"" (genitive form), which implies possession or connection to the event, while the machine translation uses ""of that event"" as a prepositional phrase, which might not convey the same level of connection.

2. **""सन माइकल्स""** (Sun Michaels) - Machine translation: ""sun micross""
   Difference: The name is misspelled in the machine translation, likely due to a mistranslation or a typing error.

3. **""फर्किएका""** (returned) - Machine translation: ""also returned""
   Difference: The source uses the past tense ""फर्किएका"" (past tense of ""फर्किएको""), while the machine translation uses ""also returned"" in the present tense, which is not accurate.

4. **""न्यु वल्ड अडर""** (New World Order) - Machine translation: ""the ufu on the nu wild odor team""
   Difference: The source refers to a specific group, ""न्यु वल्ड अडर"" (New World Order), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""the ufu on the nu wild odor team,"" which is a nonsensical phrase.

5. **""सामेल गराएका""** (included himself) - Machine translation: ""he joined""
   Difference: The source uses ""सामेल गराएका"" (past tense of ""सामेल गराएको""), which implies an action taken by Sun Michaels, while the machine translation simply states ""he joined,"" without specifying the past tense.

In summary, the machine translation has several inaccuracies, including a misspelled name, incorrect tense, and a nonsensical phrase for the group name. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the original Nepali text.

Step 1: Understand the source text
The source text in Nepali says, ""समाजवादको मार्ग प्रशस्त मध्यकालीन सामन्ती अवशेष समाप्त पारेर आधुनिक व्यबस्था लागु गर्यो"" which translates to ""The path of socialism was completed by eliminating the medieval remnants, and the modern system was adopted.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation provided is ""Advanced advantage by finishing the middle ages the path of socialism."" This translation seems to have a different focus, mentioning an ""advanced advantage"" and ""finishing the middle ages"" instead of the actual process of eliminating medieval remnants and adopting a modern system.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation
The reference translation, ""The path of socialism implemented the modern system by eliminating the medieval aurorate remnant,"" accurately captures the meaning of the source text, emphasizing the implementation of a modern system through the removal of medieval elements.

Step 4: Identify differences
The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are:
- The machine translation omits the concept of ""eliminating the remnants"" and instead uses ""finishing the middle ages"" which is not as precise.
- The reference translation uses ""aurorate remnant"" (which likely refers to feudal remnants), while the machine translation does not provide a specific term for these remnants.
- The reference translation clearly states the action of ""implementing the modern system,"" while the machine translation suggests a more vague ""advanced advantage.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation, as it loses important details and nuances from the source text, such as the process of eliminating remnants and the clear implementation of a modern system.

|Reference translation: The National Wrestling Alliance was also Japan 's governing body in all regions of the country and in remote areas.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""नेशनल रेस्लिङ एलायन्स"" (National Wrestling Alliance), which is correctly translated as ""The National Wrestling Alliance"" in both the machine and reference translations.
2. The machine translation incorrectly uses ""principality of Japan"" instead of ""यो शासकीय निकाय"" (governing body) in the context, which refers to the authority or administrative role of the National Wrestling Alliance in Japan.
3. The phrase ""देशभरका सबै क्षेत्रीय क्षेत्रहरु"" (all regions of the country) is translated as ""all regional regions of the country"" in the machine translation, which is redundant and does not convey the intended meaning as clearly as the reference translation.
4. The machine translation adds ""and in a remote region"" which is not present in the source text. The source only mentions ""टाढाको क्षेत्रमा"" (remote areas), but does not specify that it's a separate region.

|Machine translation: Nepali culture was not a nation's entry into Nepal, nor another nation's struggle.|
|Reference translation: Nepali culture, entry of one caste did not lead to the struggle of another caste in Nepal.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference 1**: The machine translation omits the specific reference to ""entry of one caste"" in the source text, which is crucial for understanding the context. The reference translation captures this aspect, making it clear that the focus is on the impact of one caste's presence on another.

2. **Difference 2**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""कुनै जातिको प्रवेशले"" (entry of any caste) as ""a nation's entry"" and ""another nation's struggle,"" which is not accurate. The source text is discussing the dynamics within Nepal, not the entry of an entire nation.

3. **Difference 3**: The machine translation misses the nuance of the struggle being specifically between castes, which is not explicitly stated but implied in the source text.

In summary, the machine translation loses important context and nuance, particularly in the description of the caste dynamics, while the reference translation more accurately captures the meaning of the source text.

|Source: भगवान् रामको जीवनमा घटित घटनाहरूले हनुमानको व्यक्तित्व विशेषताहरूले उनलाई सर्व प्रतिष्ठित 'देव' बनाइदियो।|
|Machine translation: The events that happened in the life of the goddess ram made hanuman's personality attributes to him the best performed ' Deva '|
|Reference translation: The events of God Ram 's life and personality traits of Hanuman made him prestigious God.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject**: In the source, the subject is ""भगवान् राम"" (God Ram), but the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""the goddess ram,"" which is a misunderstanding of the gender.
2. **Verb and Object**: The source states that Hanuman's personality traits (व्यक्तित्व विशेषताहरू) made him 'देव' (God), while the machine translation incorrectly uses ""the best performed 'Deva'"" which is a different meaning and does not convey the idea of him becoming prestigious due to his qualities.
3. **Prestigiousness**: The reference translation correctly conveys the idea that Hanuman became prestigious (प्रतिष्ठित) as a result of the events and his personality, whereas the machine translation does not capture this aspect.

|Reference translation: One of them was killed by the security personnel in the reading room while the other six managed to escape to the administrative block of the school.|

|Analysis|
1. **Difference in action**: The machine translation suggests that the security guard killed one of the schools, which is incorrect. The source text states that the security personnel killed ""one of them"" in the reading room, not a school.
2. **Misinterpretation of context**: The machine translation implies a conditional scenario where the escape of the other six is dependent on the guard killing someone, which is not clear from the source. The reference translation correctly presents the two separate events: the killing and the escape.
3. **Incorrect translation of ""नै""**: The word ""नै"" in the source means ""there"" or ""in that place"" (referring to the reading room), but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""remaining 6"" or ""the other six,"" which is not accurate.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: विश्वकै दुर्लभ मानिएको शमी र रुद्राक्षको रुखहरू पनि यसै जिल्लामा पाइन्छ ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The Shami and olive trees of the world are also found in this district.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Shami and Rudraksha trees that are considered rare in the world are found in this district.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation mentions ""Shami and olive trees"" while the reference translation specifies ""Shami and Rudraksha trees.""
- The machine translation omits the adjective ""दुर्लभ"" (rare) which is present in the source text and the reference translation.
- The reference translation adds the phrase ""that are considered rare in the world"" to provide context about the rarity of the trees.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity (Shami and Rudraksha vs. Shami and olive trees) and the inclusion of the adjective ""दुर्लभ"" (rare) to convey the rarity of the trees. The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually rich translation.

|Reference translation: If it also has a style of describing a place, a journey, etc. then basically journalism like style is a feature of such essays.|

|Analysis|
1. The machine translation starts with ""While it is also a style"" which is not present in the source text. The source text does not introduce a contrasting scenario or use ""while"" to express a simultaneous condition.
2. The machine translation incorrectly attributes the style to ""a banquet"" which is not mentioned in the source. The source refers to ""पत्रकारिताको शैली"" (journalistic style).
3. The machine translation omits the phrase ""मूलतः"" (basically) from the source, which is important to convey the main characteristic of the essays.
4. The machine translation uses ""the style of the letter"" instead of ""निबन्धको विशेषता"" (essays' characteristic), which is a more accurate representation of the source.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of introducing a contrasting scenario, misattributing the style, and not including the word ""मूलतः"" and the correct context of ""निबन्धको विशेषता"".

|Machine translation: But yesterday, the influence of clothing of modern styles and designs is found in little those who wear such illustrations.|
|Reference translation: But such dresses are rare these days due to the influence of modern style and designs.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text talks about the influence of modern style and designs on Nepali attire, specifically mentioning that it is less common now.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""तर हिजोआज"" (yesterday) as ""But yesterday,"" which changes the context from a general statement to a specific time frame. The reference translation uses ""these days"" which is more appropriate for the context.
3. ""आधुनिक शैली र डिजाइनका पहिरनको प्रभाव"" (the influence of clothing of modern styles and designs) is translated as ""the influence of clothing of modern styles and designs is found in little,"" which is awkward and does not convey the intended meaning that modern styles and designs are reducing the prevalence of certain attire.
4. ""यस्ता भेषभुषा"" (such attire) is translated as ""those who wear such illustrations,"" which is a misinterpretation. The correct translation should be ""such dresses.""
5. The machine translation ends with ""are found in little those who wear,"" which is not a natural or accurate way to express the rarity of the attire.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Here is a population plaintiff based on the 2005 estimate of those municipalities.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Here is a population statistics of those municipalities based on the 2005 estimate.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""population plaintiff"" which is not accurate. The source text refers to ""जनसङ्ख्या समेत"" (population data), not a legal plaintiff.
- The reference translation correctly uses ""population statistics"" which aligns with the source text.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The main difference is the interpretation of ""नगरको सन् २००५को अनुमानमा"" (municipalities' 2005 estimate) as ""population statistics"" in the reference translation, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""population plaintiff.""
- The reference translation also omits the word ""छ"" (which is a Nepali word for ""given"" or ""presented"") in the sentence, but this might not significantly affect the overall meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the interpretation of ""population data"" as ""population plaintiff"" and the absence of the word ""छ."" The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Due to his contributions, he has become a national defender of this country.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Due to his contribution, he has become a national icon of this country.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""national defender"" while the reference translation uses ""national icon.""
- The source text in Nepali mentions ""राष्ट्रिय विभूति"" (national diversity), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation, however, omits this term and replaces it with ""national icon,"" which is a more fitting term in the context of someone's significant impact.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The main difference lies in the choice of words to describe the person's impact on the country. ""National defender"" implies a more active role in defending the country, while ""national icon"" suggests a more symbolic and revered status, which is more consistent with the source text's implied meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the choice of words to describe the person's status. The reference translation better captures the idea of someone becoming a symbol of the country due to their contributions, while the machine translation focuses more on the defensive aspect.

|Reference translation: No further scientific study and research has been done on the stone archives and historical data collected with difficulty in 2012 .|

Analysis:

1. **""२०१२ तिर""** (around 2012) - Machine translation: ""around 2012"" is accurate, but the reference translation uses ""in 2012"" which is more precise in terms of time.
2. **""कष्टपूर्वक संकलन""** (collected troubles) - Machine translation: Incorrectly translated as ""that have collected troubles"". The source means ""collected with difficulty"", which is not captured in the machine translation.
3. **""अभिलेख""** (records) - Both translations are correct.
4. **""र ऐतिहासीक तथ्याङ्कहरू""** (and historical statistics) - Machine translation: Correctly translated.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: तत्पश्चात बालिकालाई गणेशको पूजा गर्न लगाई देवदेवीको मन्दिर परिक्रमा गराइन्छ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Early childhood is devoted to worshiping the mathematics.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: After that, the girl is made to worship Ganesha and is taken around the temple of Goddess.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the source text
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""तत्पश्चात"" (after that) as ""Early childhood"" instead of the intended context of a specific time after an event.
- It translates ""बालिकालाई गणेशको पूजा"" (worshiping Ganesha by a girl) as ""worshiping the mathematics,"" which is a misinterpretation of the religious context.
- ""देवदेवीको मन्दिर परिक्रमा"" (circumambulating the temple of Goddess) is not translated accurately, as it is about the girl being taken around the temple, not the act of worship itself.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation misses the specific reference to the girl (बालिका) and the act of being taken around the temple (परिक्रमा) in the source text.
- It incorrectly focuses on mathematics instead of Ganesha, which is a significant difference in the cultural and religious context.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of cultural context, specificity of the girl's actions, and the object of worship. The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: यसले के देखाउँछ भने सो समयमा मन्दिरको लागि विर्ता दिँदा पुजारीप्लाई नदिई गाउँका भद्र वा प्रमुखलाई राख्न दिएको हुन सक्छ ।
Machine translation: What it shows may be given to keep the goddess or chief of the village without giving the prize money for the temple at this time.

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The machine translation uses ""the prize money"" which is not present in the source text. The source text refers to ""विर्ता"" (Virta), which is likely a name or a term specific to the context, not a prize money.
- The machine translation has ""without giving"" (without giving the prize money), while the source text suggests that the priest (पुजारी) is the one who might be allowed to keep something (राख्न दिएको हुन सक्छ) in exchange for something else.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: This shows that at that time, the village chief may have been allowed to keep the Virta giving the priest.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text, indicating that the village chief's authority or role is being discussed in relation to ""Virta"" and the priest.
- The reference translation omits the mention of ""prize money"" and focuses on the act of giving something to the priest, which aligns better with the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the interpretation of ""विर्ता"" and the absence of the ""prize money"" concept. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the context and the relationship between the village chief, the priest, and the ""Virta"" in the Nepali-English translation.

Analysis:

|Reference translation: Tamangs build chaityas in the name of the deceased after their death and such chaityas can be found in abundance in the hills surrounding Tamang village.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference in action**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""घेवापछि"" (after taking possession) as ""his siege on someone's death vault"", which is not a direct translation. The reference translation correctly states ""after their death"".
2. **Misinterpretation of ""चैत्य तामाङ गाउँका छेउछाउका""**: The machine translation translates this phrase as ""the tamang village appears abundantly on the sides of the mountain"", which does not convey the intended meaning. The phrase actually describes the Tamangs singing and dancing around the chaityas, which is a cultural activity. The reference translation captures this by saying ""such chaityas can be found in abundance in the hills surrounding Tamang village"".
3. **Lack of context**: The machine translation does not convey the cultural context of building chaityas in memory of the deceased, which is a significant aspect of the source text.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of the action taken after death, the cultural activity associated with the chaityas, and the context of the tradition.

2. **Action**: The source mentions ""भेला भई"" (gathered together) and ""गर्ने गर्दछन"" (to share), which implies a gathering and sharing of emotions. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""swap and smile with their sweethearts,"" which is not a direct match with the source.

Analysis:

1. **Translation of ""मुलद्धारको""**: In the source, ""मुलद्धारको"" refers to ""of the main entrance"" or ""at the main entrance."" The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""worn by the,"" which does not convey the correct location.

2. **Translation of ""माथिल्लो पट्टी""**: The source mentions a ""māthillo patti,"" which is a Nepali term for the ""upper bar"" or ""upper part of the entrance."" The machine translation omits this detail, making it unclear.

3. **Translation of ""पित्तलको""**: The source uses ""पित्तलको"" to describe the context of the artistic and influential guests, possibly referring to the ""Pitt"" as a place where these guests gather. The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""of Pitt,"" which changes the meaning.

4. **Translation of ""कलात्मक तथा आकर्षक""**: Both the source and reference translation correctly convey the meaning of ""artistic and attractive"" in Nepali.

5. **Translation of ""गजुर""**: The source mentions a ""गजुर"" (Gajur), which is a brass sculpture or ornament. The machine translation does not mention the material, which is crucial for understanding the context.

6. **Translation of ""वनाइएको छ""**: The source uses a verb ""वनाइएको छ"" (is made) to describe the Gajur being made. The machine translation does not include this part, making it incomplete.

In summary, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of location, context, and the description of the Gajur. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

- यसै जनमत संग्रहपछि (After this referendum)
- राजतन्त्रको समाप्ति (end of monarchy)
- भारतीय संवैधानी व्यवस्था (Indian constitutional system)
- सिक्किमको सम्प्रभुता (Sikkim's sovereignty)

|im_start| Step 2: Compare machine translation with reference translation|
- Machine translation: ""Soon after the completion of the ranch and the completion of the Indian reservation, the Lord of sikkim was endowed under the law.""
- Reference translation: ""After this referendum, monarchy ended and Sikkim's sovereignty ended under the Indian constitutional system.""

|im_start| Step 3: Analyze differences|
1. ""ranch"" in the machine translation is not present in the source text, which refers to ""janamat"" (referendum).
2. ""the Lord of sikkim"" in the machine translation is a misinterpretation of the term ""सिक्किमको सम्प्रभुता"" (Sikkim's sovereignty).
3. ""was endowed under the law"" in the machine translation is not accurate, as the source text implies the end of the monarchy and sovereignty, not an endowment.

|im_start| Step 4: Conclusion|
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the event being described (referendum vs. ranch completion) and the interpretation of the sovereignty.

Comparison:
1. **""पादरी"" vs ""bishops"":** The machine translation uses ""bishops"" which is not an accurate term for ""पादरी"" (pastor) in Nepali. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""pastor.""
2. **""कुलीन"" vs ""culinary class"":** The machine translation translates ""कुलीन"" (elite) as ""culinary class,"" which is not correct. The reference translation correctly uses ""elite.""
3. **""विशेष सुबिधा"" vs ""special conveniences"":** Both translations convey a similar idea, but the reference translation is more direct and clear.
4. **""सर्वसाधारणमध्ये"" vs ""the state of the farmers and magistrates of the public"":** The machine translation adds ""magistrates"" which is not present in the source text. The reference translation omits this detail and focuses on the farmers and common people.
5. **""किसान तथा मजदूरको अवस्था"" vs ""the state of farmers and laborers"":** The machine translation uses ""state"" which is less specific than ""अवस्था"" (condition) in the source. The reference translation captures this nuance.
6. **""एकदमै गुज्रेको"" vs ""very loose"":** The machine translation uses ""very loose,"" which is a different interpretation of ""गुज्रेको"" (badly affected, deteriorated). The reference translation is closer to the original meaning.

In summary, the machine translation has several inaccuracies and differences in terms of vocabulary and nuance compared to the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the source text.

|Source: यो खेलमा स्लोभाकियाका जान ड्युरिका, स्ट्यानिस्लाभ सेस्टेक र भ्लादिमिर विज तथा पाराग्वेका एनरिक भेरालाई पहेंलो कार्ड देखाइएको थियो।|
|Machine translation: In this game, durica to go to Slovakia, stanislav sestak and Vladimir wins and Paraguay's Enric Vera were shown a yellow card.|
|Reference translation: Slovakia 's Jan Durica , Stanislav Sestak and Vladimir Weiss and Paraguay 's Enrique Vera were shown yellow cards .|

**Analysis:**

1. **Subject identification**: In the source, the subject is ""स्लोभाकियाका जान ड्युरिका"" (Jan Durica from Slovakia), but the machine translation incorrectly states ""durica to go to Slovakia"", which implies a movement rather than identifying Durica as the subject.

2. **Names and proper nouns**: The machine translation omits the last name ""विज"" (Weiss) for Vladimir, while the reference translation includes it. This results in a difference in the full name ""Vladimir Weiss"" in the reference.

3. **Action description**: The source mentions that they were ""पहेंलो कार्ड"" (received a card), but the machine translation incorrectly translates this to ""wins"", which is not a suitable verb for receiving a card in a sports context.

4. **Plural form**: The source uses the plural form ""भ्लादिमिर विज तथा"" (and Vladimir Weiss), while the machine translation combines the names into a single sentence without the plural form, making it unclear that both individuals received a yellow card.

5. **Verb agreement**: The source uses the passive voice ""देखाइएको थियो"" (were shown), but the machine translation uses the active voice ""were shown"", which is more accurate.

6. **Punctuation and capitalization**: The reference translation correctly capitalizes the country name ""Paraguay"" and adds commas to separate the names, while the machine translation does not.

In summary, the machine translation has several errors in terms of subject identification, name accuracy, verb choice, and punctuation, leading to a less accurate representation of the source text.

|Source: रैनादेवीको मूलपुजारी पनि मगर रहनुले धार्मिक कार्यमा पनि मगरहरू अगाडि रहेको पुष्टि हुन्छ ।|
|Machine translation: Rainadevi's robot is also a magistrate who is in front of the magistrates in justice.|
|Reference translation: Magar being Rainadevi 's chief priest also proves that the Magars are ahead in religious activities as well.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text is about Rainadevi's main priest (मूलपुजारी) and the context of their religious activities (धार्मिक कार्यमा).
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""मगर रहनुले"" (which means ""remaining"" or ""besides"") as ""robot"" and ""in front of the magistrates"" (which is a metaphorical reference to their position in religious matters), creating a completely unrelated meaning.
3. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning that the fact that Rainadevi's main priest is still around (मगर रहनुले) serves as proof (पुष्टि) that the Magars are ahead in religious activities (अगाडि रहेको).

|Conclusion|
The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation by misinterpreting the source text and creating a misleading context about a robot being a magistrate. The correct translation should focus on the role of Rainadevi's main priest as a religious figure and the connection to the Magars' religious advancement, as in the reference translation.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: यस  प्रकार पुरन्दरका किल्लामा पनि तिनको अधिकार स्थापित भयो ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: So her authority was established in the tower of Purander.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In this way, his power was established in the Purandar Fort.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The source text refers to ""तिनको अधिकार"" (his/her authority), while the machine translation assumes it's ""her authority"" without specifying gender. The reference translation correctly uses ""his power.""
- The source text uses ""पुरन्दरका किल्लामा"" (the Purander's tower), which is a more specific term. The machine translation generalizes it to ""tower of Purander,"" losing the specificity. The reference translation keeps the specificity by using ""Purandar Fort.""
- The structure of the sentence is slightly different: the source text has a more direct connection between ""यस प्रकार"" (in this way) and the establishment of authority, while the machine translation separates them with ""So."" The reference translation maintains the connection.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of gender specificity, the specificity of the location (tower vs. fort), and the sentence structure. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the source text.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: His stories contain analysis of mental disturbances and traumatic state of mind that arises when one's self-esteem is challenged.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation mentions ""inhalation of minds"" which is not present in the source text or the reference translation. This is a mistranslation or an incorrect interpretation.
- The machine translation refers to ""an influence on spirituality,"" while the source text talks about ""ātmapratिष्ठामाथि āghāta"" (self-esteem being challenged), which is a more specific context related to mental well-being.
- The reference translation accurately captures the concept of ""mental disturbances"" and ""traumatic state of mind"" in the context of self-esteem being challenged.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the incorrect interpretation of ""inhalation of minds"" and the more specific context of self-esteem being challenged instead of a general influence on spirituality.

|Reference translation: Plays like ' Aṅgikो Katha ', ' Putali Ko Ghar ', and ' Bagh Bhairav ' staged in Gurukul have made a special impact in the contemporary Nepali theater.|

Analysis:
1. **Plural form**: The source text uses ""नाटकहरू"" (plural for 'plays') which is not translated in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly uses ""Plays like"".
2. **Specific titles**: The source mentions three titles - 'अग्निको कथा', 'पुतलीको घर', and 'बाघ भैरव'. The machine translation combines them into a single phrase, losing the individuality. The reference translation keeps them separate, as ""Agniiko Katha"", ""Putali Ko Ghar"", and ""Bagh Bhairav"".
3. **Context**: The machine translation refers to ""contemporary nepali colour"", which is not a standard phrase in this context. The reference translation uses ""contemporary Nepali theater"" which is more appropriate.
4. **Impact**: The machine translation uses ""distinct place"", while the reference translation uses ""special impact"", which conveys a stronger sense of the influence these plays have had.

Overall, the machine translation is less accurate in terms of preserving the original meaning and structure compared to the reference translation. It loses the plural context, specific titles, and the nuance of the impact on the theater.

|Analysis|
1. **Time reference**: The machine translation uses ""brahmins"" which refers to a specific caste, while the reference translation uses ""Brahmamuhurta"" (a time period during the day for religious rituals) to describe the context. The machine translation is incorrect here.
2. **Subject and action**: The source mentions ""he and his student group"" (शिष्यमण्दलीका साथमा) going to the ghat, but the machine translation incorrectly translates this to ""he was with his teachers"" and implies the street is going to the ghats, which is not accurate.
3. **Destination**: The machine translation mentions ""warangasnan"" instead of ""Varanasi"" (वाराणसी), which is the correct location.
4. **Purpose**: The machine translation states ""going to the mendicant ghats"" but does not specify the purpose, which is to bathe in the Ganga (गङ्गास्नान). The reference translation includes this detail.

- Time reference: वि.स.१७९४ (1794)
- Context: राजा कल्याणसिहका पालादेखि (According to the records of the palace of kalantseh)
- Independence: स्वतन्त्र राजाको हैसियतमा (independence of the king)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.

- Reference translation: The Kingdom of bazhang appears to be independent from the time of king kalyansingh according to the records of 1794.

Step 3: Analyze differences:
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""राजा कल्याणसिहका पालादेखि"" as ""the hunting of the independent king,"" which is a misinterpretation. The phrase should be translated as ""from the time of king kalyansingh.""
- The reference translation omits the unnecessary ""in the"" before ""hunting"" and adds ""from the time of"" to clarify the time reference.

|Analysis|
1. The source text is discussing a specific cultural or religious ritual related to shaving hair at birth, which is referred to as ""बुसँखा संस्कार"" (Bushankha ritual).
2. The machine translation attempts to replicate the words ""बुसँखा संस्कार"" but does so repeatedly and incorrectly, resulting in a nonsensical string of ""hair of the hair"" phrases.

4. The machine translation lacks coherence and context, while the reference translation provides a clear and meaningful translation.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of meaning, coherence, and context.

|Reference translation: Recognized by Sanatan Dharma based on Veda, born as the eldest son of King Suddhodhana, Siddhartha Gautam became the person made through strong contemplative power, devotion, and penance.|

|Analysis|
1. **Vedaमा आधारित** (Based on Veda) vs **वेदमा आधारित** (Based on Veda): The machine translation uses ""based on the altar"" which is a literal translation of ""वेदमा आधारित"" but misses the context that it refers to the ancient Hindu scriptures, Veda. The reference translation correctly conveys this meaning.

2. **राजा सुद्धोधनका जेठा छोराको रुपमा** (the eldest son of the assumed king, in the form of a snake) vs **the eldest son of the assumed king**: The machine translation omits the detail about the transformation into a snake, which is a significant part of the story. It also uses ""against the power"" which is not present in the source.

3. **जन्मिएका सिद्धार्थ गौतम** (Siddhartha Gautam, who was born) vs **Born as...**: The machine translation does not mention the name Siddhartha Gautam, which is crucial in identifying the subject.

4. **चिन्तन शक्ति, लगन र तपस्याद्वारा सिद्ध पूरुष** (made through strong contemplative power, devotion, and penance) vs **LED by Logan and tapus**: The machine translation incorrectly attributes the process of becoming a man to Logan and tapus, which are likely names or concepts from a different context.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: उनको बुबा घरबाट टाढा काम गर्ने भएकाले एम्ब्रोजले बुबालाई भेट्न निकै गाह्राे हुन्थ्यो ।
Machine translation: Ambrose, because his father worked far away from home, was very hard to find.

Step 2: Identify differences in sentence structure and word choice.
- In the source text, ""उनको बुबा"" refers to ""Ambrose's father"" and ""घरबाट टाढा"" means ""far away from home.""
- The verb ""घरबाट टाढा काम गर्ने"" is translated to ""worked far away"" in the machine translation, which is accurate.
- The phrase ""भएकाले"" is not directly translated, but it's not crucial for the meaning.
- ""भेट्न निकै गाह्राे हुन्थ्यो"" is translated as ""was very hard to find,"" which is the main point of the sentence.

Step 3: Analyze the translation quality.
The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, with the correct translation of the father working far from home and the difficulty in finding Ambrose. However, it omits the name ""Ambrose"" from the beginning, which is a minor error. The phrase ""भएकाले"" is not translated, but it's not essential to the meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but loses the name ""Ambrose"" and omits a less important phrase. The overall meaning is preserved, but with some minor differences in structure. The quality could be improved by including the name and maintaining the original sentence structure as closely as possible.

|Machine translation: The Temple is featured in the burial grounds of the tirthankaras and lives in the village.|
|Reference translation: The Gaadhi house in the temple premises has food and accommodation facilities for the pilgrims.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to a ""गाधीघरमा"" (Gaadhi house) within the ""मन्दिर परिसरमा"" (temple premises), not the temple itself being located in burial grounds or a village.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""रहेको"" (is located) to ""is featured"" and ""तिर्थयात्रीहरूको लागी"" (for the pilgrims) to ""for the tirthankaras,"" which are not accurate in this context.
3. The reference translation correctly identifies the Gaadhi house as the location providing facilities and specifies that these are for ""तिर्थयात्रीहरू"" (pilgrims).

|Conclusion|
The machine translation deviates from the reference translation in several aspects. It incorrectly interprets the location of the Gaadhi house and the facilities it offers. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text, describing the Gaadhi house within the temple premises as a place with food and accommodation for pilgrims.

|Reference translation: Similarly, a significant number of Newars are now living in other Asian countries, European and American countries.|

|Analysis|
1. **""यसैगरी हाल""** (Since then) - Machine translation: ""Since then"" is accurate, but the reference translation uses ""Similarly"" which is a more appropriate word choice in this context, as it implies a parallel situation rather than a specific time point.
2. **""एसियाका अन्य देशहरू""** (countries in Asia) - Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation omits the word ""हरू"" (plural) for brevity.
3. **""युरोपीय र अमेरिकी मुलुकहरूमा""** (European and American countries) - Machine translation: ""including other countries in Asia, Europe and the Americas"" is correct, but the reference translation combines ""Europe"" and ""American"" into ""European and American countries"" for a clearer structure.
4. **""नेवारहरूको उल्लेख्य संख्यामा""** (the number of Newars) - Both translations mention the significant number of Newars, but the reference translation omits ""उल्लेख्य"" (significant) for brevity.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate, but there are a few improvements that could be made for better clarity and cultural adaptation, such as using ""Similarly"" instead of ""Since then"" and simplifying the phrase ""including other countries in Asia, Europe and the Americas"" to ""European and American countries."" The main difference lies in the choice of words and sentence structure to make the translation more idiomatic and concise.

|Reference translation: Writer Viskhu wrote around 4 dozens of stories in his 33 years long history of story writing.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""कथालेखनको करिब ३३ वर्षे"" (approximately 33 years of storytelling), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""a 33-year journal of his storytelling"" and omits the context of the journey or the fact that it's about a person's life.
2. The source mentions ""कथाकार भिक्षुले"" (a storyteller named Bhikshu), but the machine translation does not include this specific name, which is crucial for identifying the subject.
3. The source uses ""करिब ४ दर्जन जति"" (around 4 dozen) to describe the number of stories, while the machine translation uses ""almost 4 dozen stories,"" which is a similar but less precise term.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- It loses the context of the journey and the specific name of the storyteller (Bhikshu).
- It does not convey the original meaning of ""करिब ४ दर्जन जति"" as precisely as the reference translation does.

Step 1: Understand the source text
The source text in Nepali says, ""यी निकायहरु बिभागमा छुट पाउने निकायको रुपमा दर्ता हुनु पर्दैन ।"" This sentence can be translated to English as, ""They should not be registered as separate entities in this department for leave purposes.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation provided is, ""These agencies should not be registered as separate agencies in participation.""

Step 3: Identify differences
The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are:
1. The machine translation uses ""agencies"" instead of ""bodies"" or ""entities,"" which might not be the most accurate term in this context.
2. The machine translation mentions ""in participation,"" which is not present in the source text. The reference translation uses ""as exempt bodies,"" which better conveys the idea that they don't need to be registered for leave-related matters.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it changes the meaning slightly by using ""agencies"" and adding ""in participation."" The reference translation, ""These bodies do not need to be registered with the department as exempt bodies,"" is a more faithful representation of the source text.

|Machine translation: However, Gandhi has said in his obituary that he was never worthy of this honour.|
|Reference translation: However , Gandhi said in his autobiography that he never felt that he was worthy of this honor .|

Analysis:
1. **Difference in context**: The machine translation refers to ""obituary"" (which is typically written after someone's death), while the reference translation uses ""autobiography"" (a life story written by the person themselves). This is a significant difference in the context of the statement.
2. **Change in meaning**: The machine translation implies that Gandhi's statement was made in an obituary, suggesting that it was a posthumous reflection, whereas the reference translation indicates that it was a personal account in his own words, reflecting his thoughts at the time.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of context and the interpretation of Gandhi's statement. The reference translation captures the idea that Gandhi felt unworthy of the honor, which is a more nuanced and personal expression than the machine translation's suggestion of a posthumous judgment.

|Reference translation: The song tells the story of Lord Krishna 's father Vasudev who went to Mathura king Kansh 's house to ask for the marriage proposal of Devki, sister of Kansh, till her marriage.|

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""उक्त गीतमा"" (In that song), which is translated as ""In that song"" in both machine and reference translations, so there's no difference here.
2. ""भगवान कृष्णका पिता वशुदेव"" (Lord Krishna's father Vasudev) is correctly translated as ""Lord Krishna's father Vasudev"" in both, but the reference adds the possessive 's, which is not present in the machine translation.
3. ""मथुराका राजा कंशका घरमा"" (the king of Mathura Kansh's house) is translated as ""the house of the king of mathura"" in the machine translation, while the reference adds the name ""Kansh"" and the possessive 's, making it ""Mathura king Kansh's house.""
4. ""कंशकी बहिनी देवकी"" (Devaki, sister of Kansh) is translated as ""Devaki's sister Devaki"" in the machine translation, but the reference correctly mentions ""Devki, sister of Kansh"" without repeating Devaki's name.
5. ""हात माग्न गए देखि"" (saw and asked for her hand) is translated as ""since devaki's father went to ask for the hand of Devaki's sister Devaki"" in the machine translation, which is a bit awkward and misses the context of seeing Devaki. The reference translation is clearer, saying ""to ask for the marriage proposal.""
6. ""देवकीको विवाहको तयारी सम्मको कथा वर्णन गरिएको छ"" (the story is described of the marriage preparation) is translated as ""the story is described in the preparation of the wedding of Devaki"" in the machine translation, which omits the context of marriage proposal. The reference adds ""till her marriage"" to clarify the end goal.

In summary, the machine translation is missing some context and clarity, particularly in the description of the event and the relationship between the characters. The reference translation provides a more accurate and coherent representation of the source text.

|Source: तथापि, यिनीहरू चिनियाँ मूलका नभएर तिब्बत बर्मेली परिवारका सबैभन्दा पूराना जातिहरू हुन्।|
|Machine translation: Nevertheless, these are the oldest nations of the Tibet Burmese family, not of Chinese roots.|
|Reference translation: However , they are not of Chinese descent and are the oldest ethnic group in the Tibetan Burmese family .|

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""तथापि"" (Nevertheless), which is correctly translated as ""However"" in the reference translation.
2. ""यिनीहरू"" (these) is translated as ""these"" in both, which is accurate.
3. ""चिनियाँ मूलका"" (of Chinese roots) is translated as ""of Chinese roots"" in the machine translation, but the reference translation uses ""Chinese descent"" instead. The meaning is similar but ""descent"" is a more appropriate term for the context, as it refers to the ethnic or ancestral background.
4. ""नभएर"" (not) is translated as ""not"" in both, but the placement of ""not"" in the reference translation is more natural, after ""they are.""
5. ""तिब्बत बर्मेली परिवारका"" (Tibetan Burmese family) is translated accurately in both.
6. ""सबैभन्दा पूराना जातिहरू"" (the oldest ethnic group) is translated as ""the oldest nations"" in the machine translation, but it should be ""the oldest ethnic group"" to maintain the correct meaning.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the choice of words ""Chinese roots"" vs. ""Chinese descent"" and the placement of ""not."" The reference translation is more natural and accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text.

|Source: यो आन्दोलनबाट नेपाली काग्रेसलाई दरोगति प्राप्त भयो।|
|Machine translation: From this revolution, nepali rajas received a degree.|
|Reference translation: From this revolution, Nepali Congress received a great pace.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""नेपाली काग्रेस"" (Nepali Congress), which is a political party in Nepal, not ""nepali rajas"" (Nepali rulers or kings).
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""दरोगति प्राप्त"" (received a degree) as if it's referring to an academic achievement. In this context, it should be translated as ""received a great pace"" or ""made progress,"" which is closer to the reference translation's ""received a great pace.""
3. The reference translation captures the intended meaning of the source, emphasizing the political impact of the revolution on the Nepali Congress.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it incorrectly identifies the subject as ""nepali rajas"" instead of ""Nepali Congress"" and误解了 the phrase ""दरोगति प्राप्त"" as a degree, when it should be translated as a pace or progress. The reference translation better reflects the meaning of the source text.

|Reference translation: We can pave the way for prosperity if we become aware and conscious and have the knowledge to look for the good ojects even from the bad and the worst.|

**Analysis:**

1. **""जागरुक"" (aware) vs. ""able to keep the gan looking"":** The machine translation uses ""gan"" which is not a suitable term in this context. It seems to be a confusion or mistranslation, while the reference translation uses ""aware"" and ""conscious"" to convey the same idea.

2. **""चेतनशील"" (conscious) vs. ""ambiguously cheating"":** The machine translation incorrectly translates ""चेतनशील"" as ""ambiguously cheating,"" which does not make sense in the context. The reference translation correctly uses ""conscious"" to describe the state.

3. **""कमसल"" (bad) vs. ""from the gossip"":** The machine translation adds ""gossip"" which is not present in the source text. The reference translation uses ""bad"" and ""the worst"" to describe the context.

4. **""खराबीबाट पनि असल वस्तु"" (even from the bad) vs. ""looking for good objects"":** The machine translation reverses the meaning, stating that the segment is looking for good objects from bad situations, while the reference translation correctly states that one should have the knowledge to find good objects even from bad situations.

5. **""समृद्धिको मार्ग खोल्न सक्छौ"" (we can pave the way for prosperity) vs. ""open the path of growth"":** The machine translation uses ""growth"" but does not convey the idea of ""prosperity"" as in the reference translation.

In summary, the machine translation has significant differences in terms of vocabulary, context, and meaning compared to the reference translation. It fails to capture the essence of the original Nepali text accurately.

|Machine translation: Delivery is believed to have received larger sizes if the sun worshipped.|
|Reference translation: It is believed that a person born in Hasta Nakshatra will attain great accomplishments if he worships the Sun God.|
|Analysis:|
1. The source text is about a belief regarding the connection between a person's birth in the Hasta Nakshatra (a zodiac sign) and the worship of the Sun God, leading to great achievements.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""हस्ता नक्षत्रका जातकले"" (a person born in Hasta Nakshatra) as ""Delivery"" (which is a verb and does not convey the zodiac aspect).
3. ""सूर्यदेवको आराधना"" (worship of the Sun God) is translated as ""the sun worshipped"" (implying a passive action, whereas the correct meaning is active).
4. ""ठूलाठूला सिद्धि प्राप्त गर्ने"" (attaining great accomplishments) is translated as ""received larger sizes"" (which is a completely different concept).

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of conveying the correct meaning related to the zodiac sign, the action of worship, and the outcome of the belief. The reference translation accurately captures the original intent, while the machine translation fails to do so.

|Machine translation: Only the mother's milk is a statue of life not for polygyny.|
|Reference translation: Mother 's milk is not only for nutrition but also for life.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text in Nepali discusses milk as a source of nutrition and life, not as a statue or related to polygyny.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""नभएर"" (not for) as ""not for polygyny,"" which is a misunderstanding of the context. The correct interpretation would be ""not just for.""
3. The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning that milk is not only for nutrition but also essential for life.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation deviates from the reference translation in two main aspects: it incorrectly translates ""नभएर"" and introduces a concept of polygyny that is not present in the source text. The correct translation should emphasize the dual role of mother's milk in nutrition and sustenance, as in the reference translation.

|Machine translation: The establishment and national guard developed into the new cheetah ruins.|

|Analysis|
1. **""स्थायित्व"" (stability)**: The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""establishment"" and ""national guard"", which are not the same concepts as stability. The reference translation correctly uses ""newer realizations of stability"".
2. **""राष्ट्रिय गौरव"" (national pride)**: The machine translation omits this part, which is crucial for conveying the context. The reference translation includes it as ""national pride"".
3. **""नयाँ चेतना"" (new awareness)**: The machine translation translates this as ""new cheetah ruins"", which is a literal and unrelated interpretation. The reference translation keeps it as ""newer realizations"", which is more appropriate.
4. **""रुसमा विकास"" (Russian development)**: The machine translation incorrectly places this phrase after ""new cheetah ruins"", suggesting a physical transformation. The reference translation correctly places it at the end, indicating that these realizations are happening in Russia.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of understanding the meaning and context of the source text. It incorrectly translates key concepts and structures, leading to a loss of meaning. The reference translation, on the other hand, accurately captures the essence of the source, conveying the idea of new realizations of stability and national pride developing in Russia.

Machine translation: ""The principal obligations found in this kind of banishment that are neglected by the investigation or spiritual inquiry are:""
Reference translation: ""This types of essays which are close to autobiography has the following features:""

Step 3: Analyze differences
1. The source sentence is discussing ""नजीक रहने यस किसिमका निबन्धमा"" (essays that are close to autobiography or self-reflection), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""principal obligations found in this kind of banishment.""
2. The machine translation introduces the concept of ""neglected by the investigation or spiritual inquiry,"" which is not present in the source sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, focuses on the features of such essays.
3. The structure of the sentences is different: the source is a question or statement, while the machine translation is a statement, and the reference translation is a list format.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Gopal means to look after cattle, and Govinda means to look for cattle.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- In the machine translation, ""रेखदेख गर्ने"" (to look with a line, or to inspect) is translated as ""to look for"" which is not accurate. The reference translation uses ""look after"" which is more contextually appropriate for the meaning of taking care of cattle.
- The reference translation correctly separates the meanings for Gopal and Govinda, while the machine translation combines them.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""रेखदेख गर्ने"" as ""to look for"" instead of ""to look after.""
- The reference translation separates the actions for Gopal and Govinda, while the machine translation conflates them.

|Machine translation: In addition to private purchases, there are also some queens, or perennial plants.|
|Reference translation: In addition to private forests, there are also some queen forests i.e. Parti forests.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""खरवनी"" (private purchases) in the context of Nepali forests, which is translated as ""private purchases"" in the machine translation. However, the reference translation correctly identifies this as ""private forests"" (निजीवनका अतिरिक्त खरवनी).

3. The machine translation omits the Nepali term ""पर्ती वनहरू"" (Parti forests) from the translation, which is crucial for understanding the context.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several aspects. It incorrectly translates ""खरवनी"" as ""private purchases"" instead of ""private forests"" and does not include the specific Nepali term ""पर्ती वनहरू"" (Parti forests).

|Reference translation: According to legend , in the 14th century , a prince from Kham 's Minyak Palace in Khye Bumsa , eastern Tibet was ordered to go south one night , according to divine vision .|

Analysis:
1. **""मान्यताको अनुसार"" (According to the assumption)**: The machine translation uses ""according to the assumption"", which is a less specific term than ""legend"" used in the reference translation. The reference implies a traditional or folk tale, while the machine translation could be more open to a general belief or guess.

2. **""१४ औ शताब्दिमा"" (14th century)**: Both translations convey the same time frame.

3. **""ख्ये बुम्सा"" (Khye Bumsa)**: The names are the same in both translations.

4. **""पूर्वी तिब्बतमा"" (Eastern Tibet)**: The location is correctly translated.

5. **""खामको मिन्यक महलको"" (Kham's Minyak Palace)**: The machine translation omits the possessive ""Kham's"" and places it after ""minyak palace"", which is less clear.

6. **""एक राजकुमार"" (a prince)**: Both translations mention a prince.

7. **""एक रात"" (one night)**: The machine translation uses ""nightly daily scene"" which is not a clear reference to a single night.

8. **""दैवीय दृष्टिको अनुसार"" (according to divine vision)**: The machine translation omits this phrase, which is a key part of the story's context.

In summary, the machine translation loses some clarity and cultural context by using ""assumption"" instead of ""legend"", omits the possessive ""Kham's"", and does not convey the ""divine vision"" aspect as clearly as the reference translation. The phrase ""nightly daily scene"" is also a less accurate representation of the original meaning.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: यसका लागि पत्रपत्रिकामा र श्रव्यदृश्य सामग्री मार्फत सार्वजनि गर्नु पर्छ ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Must be moved through the magazine and audience content for it.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: This should be made public through the newspaper and audiovisual.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the source text
- The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the verb ""गर्नु पर्छ"" (which means ""should be made"" or ""to be done"") and translated it as ""moved"" or ""for it.""
- The source text mentions ""पत्रपत्रिकामा"" (newspaper) and ""श्रव्यदृश्य सामग्री"" (audiovisual content), while the machine translation combines them into ""magazine and audience content.""
- The reference translation correctly separates the two media types and uses the appropriate term ""public"" to convey the idea of making something known to the public.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation lacks the nuance of the source text, specifically the verb ""गर्नु पर्छ"" and the distinction between ""newspaper"" and ""audiovisual.""
- The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It loses the intended meaning and structure, particularly in the handling of the verb and the separation of newspaper and audiovisual content. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text.

- Reference translation: ""The foundation also helped to advance to run the 'Tibetan Khampa Disarmament Campaign'.""

Differences:
1. ""सो प्रतिष्ठान"" (the foundation) is translated as ""It was also helped"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly identifies the subject as ""The foundation.""
2. ""निशस्त्रीकरण अभियान"" (disarmament campaign) is translated as ""dissolvement campaign"" in the machine translation, which is a misunderstanding. The correct term in English should be ""disarmament"" to convey the idea of reducing weapons, not dissolution.
3. ""अघि बढाउन"" (to proceed or advance) is translated as ""to proceed with"" in the machine translation, which is a bit less precise than the reference translation's ""to advance to run.""

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation has some inaccuracies, particularly in the term ""dissolvement campaign"" and the way it connects the foundation's action to the campaign. The reference translation is clearer and more accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text, emphasizing the foundation's role in advancing the Tibetan Khampa Disarmament Campaign.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: त्यसैगरी भारतको राजस्थानको जोधपुर क्षेत्रमा पनि रैनादेवीको पुजा गर्ने प्रचलन रहेको पाइन्छ ।
Machine translation: Sometimes it is found that the reach of ranadevi is also found in the jodhpur region of India.

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The source text mentions ""त्यसैगरी"" (that sea), which is likely a reference to a specific context or event. The machine translation omits this detail.
- The source uses ""भारतको राजस्थानको"" (India's Rajasthan's) to specify the location, while the machine translation combines it into ""the jodhpur region of India"" without the possessive and state information.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Similarly, it is found that the reach of ranadevi is also found in the Rajesthan's jodhpur region of India.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The reference translation adds ""Similarly"" to connect the idea with something else that has been mentioned, which is not present in the machine translation.
- The reference translation correctly includes the possessive ""Rajesthan's"" to indicate that Jodhpur belongs to the state of Rajasthan.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of specificity (omitting ""त्यसैगरी"" and ""भारतको राजस्थानको"") and context (lacking the ""Similarly"" and the possessive ""Rajesthan's""). The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: द रकले अस्टिनलाई झुक्यादिएका थिए सोही मौका छोपेर म्याकमेनले अस्टिनलाई डोरीबाट खसालेर

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The Rock had fallen Austin by the same chance as the mcmen dropped Austin from the ropes.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The Rock had confused Austin, and McMahon seized the opportunity to pull Austin off the ropes.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- In the machine translation, ""झuk्यादिएका"" (fallen) is translated as ""had fallen,"" which is a past tense verb, while the source text uses the verb in a different context, possibly implying a sudden action or confusion rather than a past event.
- ""Sohi māuka"" (same chance) is translated as ""by the same chance,"" which is a reasonable interpretation but could be more accurately translated as ""in the confusion"" or ""while Austin was disoriented.""
- ""Mymen"" is not translated, likely because it's a proper noun or a specific term that might not have a direct translation, but it's understood as ""McMahon"" in the reference translation.
- ""Doribāt"" (from the ropes) is translated as ""from the ropes,"" which is correct, but the reference translation adds ""to pull"" (off) to give a clearer sense of action.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of verb tense and context, as well as the inclusion of ""McMahon"" and the action of pulling Austin off the ropes. The machine translation could be improved by considering the context of confusion and using a more accurate verb to describe the situation.

|Source: जब जब धर्मको हानि हुन्छ, अधर्मको वृद्धि हुन्छ त्यस बेलामा मैले आफुलाई प्रकट गरेको हुन्छु ।|
|Machine translation: I have revealed myself in the days of the righteous, when the growth of the unrighteous is increased.|
|Reference translation: Whenever there is loss of religion , increase of unrighteousness , then I have presented myself.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Time expression**: The source uses ""जब जब"" (whenever) to express a condition, which is translated as ""in the days of"" in the machine translation. This is a less direct translation, but the meaning is preserved.
2. **Loss of religion vs. unrighteousness**: The source mentions ""धर्मको हानि"" (loss of religion) and ""अधर्मको वृद्धि"" (increase of unrighteousness) as separate concepts. The machine translation combines them into ""the growth of the unrighteous,"" which omits the distinction between the two.
3. **Sentence structure**: The source sentence structure is more straightforward, with the main clause ""मैले आफुलाई प्रकट गरेको हुन्छु"" (I have presented myself) following the condition. The machine translation places it at the end, which is a minor difference but still conveys the intended meaning.

Overall, the machine translation captures the essence of the source text but loses some nuance in the distinction between the loss of religion and the increase of unrighteousness. The sentence structure is also slightly altered, but the meaning remains clear.

|Machine translation: The worms operated economic, social activities to the woods in the west.|
|Reference translation: The Kirants operated economic , social activities in the west part of Kathmandu|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject difference**: The source text refers to ""किरातीहरू"" (Kirants), a specific ethnic group, while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""worms"" (which is ""कुत्तों"" in Nepali).
2. **Location difference**: The source specifies ""पश्चिममा काठमाडौं"" (west part of Kathmandu), which is a specific location within Kathmandu. The machine translation omits this context, simply stating ""to the woods in the west,"" which is less precise.
3. **Sentence structure**: The reference translation maintains the original structure of the source, with ""सञ्चालन गरेका थिए"" (they operated), while the machine translation rephrases it in a way that is less natural and accurate.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the subject, location specificity, and sentence structure, leading to a lower quality translation.

|Reference translation: After that, he took the responsibility of the head of technical department and made three rifle, sharp pistol, two inch mortar, and 81 mm mortar shell.|

|Analysis|
1. ""त्यसपछि"" (After that) - Machine translation: ""Then"" - The difference is in the choice of words, ""त्यसपछि"" is a more specific Nepali phrase for ""after that"" while ""Then"" is a more general English equivalent.
2. ""प्राविधिक विभागप्रमुखको जिम्मेवारी"" (head of technical department's responsibility) - Machine translation: ""technical division"" - The machine translation omits the context of responsibility, which is important for understanding the role.
3. ""लिएर"" (forming) - Machine translation: ""forming"" - The machine translation is accurate here, but it's not clear from the context whether it means ""formed"" or ""took charge of forming.""
4. ""थ्रीनट थ्री राइफल"" (three rifle) - Machine translation: ""threonaut three rifle"" - The machine translation adds a term ""threonaut"" which is not present in the source or reference, likely a misunderstanding.
5. ""कटुवा पेस्तोल"" (sharp pistol) - Machine translation: ""cotton pesticide"" - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""कटुवा"" (sharp) as ""cotton"" and ""पेस्तोल"" (pistol) as ""pesticide.""
6. ""टु इन्च मोर्टार"" (two inch mortar) - Machine translation: ""tu inch mortar"" - The machine translation omits the word ""टु"" (two) and is not clear about the unit, while the reference translation is correct.
7. ""८१ एमएम मोर्टार सेल"" (81 mm mortar shell) - Machine translation: ""81 mm mortar shell"" - The machine translation is accurate here.

In summary, the machine translation has several errors in terms of word choice, context, and mistranslation of specific terms. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: With this , he scored against all 19 Premier League opponents in the same season .

- The machine translation has ""विपक्षी"" which means ""opponents"" in Nepali, while the reference translation omits it, as it is implied by ""Premier League opponents.""
- The machine translation uses ""the premier league"" with a space, while the reference translation combines it as ""Premier League"" without a space.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality
The machine translation captures the main idea but loses some nuance by not including ""विपक्षी"" and slightly altering the structure. The reference translation is more concise and clear, maintaining the meaning of the source text.

1. **Difference in verb structure**: The machine translation uses ""hold economic purposes"" which is translated as ""राज्यकारी उद्देश्य बनाउन"" in Nepali, while the reference translation uses ""to achieve economic goals"" as ""आर्थिक लक्ष्य अर्जन कर्न"". The machine translation uses a more literal translation, whereas the reference translation uses a more natural and idiomatic phrasing in English.
2. **Omission of ""must""**: The reference translation includes the word ""must"" (मुस्त) to emphasize the necessity, which is not present in the machine translation. This makes the reference translation sound stronger in terms of the requirement for the community.
3. **Order of phrases**: The reference translation reorders the phrases ""to protect local culture or language"" and ""to achieve economic goals"" to make it clearer that both are reasons for forming a regional government, while the machine translation presents them as separate actions.

|Reference translation: As per Hinduism, Krishna is considered as one form of god Vishnu's 10 forms.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference in religious context**: The machine translation refers to ""pseudohindu scriptures,"" which is incorrect. The source text uses ""हिन्दू धर्म"" (Hinduism), which is a more accurate term for the religious context.

2. **Subject of the sentence**: The source talks about ""भगवान विष्णुको"" (god Vishnu), while the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""the goddess"" as the subject.

3. **Number of avatars**: The source states that Krishna is considered ""दश मुख्य अवतारहरू"" (ten main avatars), whereas the machine translation incorrectly mentions ""ten main avatars of the goddess"" without specifying the connection to Vishnu.

4. **Translation of ""mध्यको"" (middle):** The machine translation omits this term, which in the source indicates that one of the avatars is considered to be from the middle period.

5. **Structure and grammar**: The machine translation has a different sentence structure, which affects the clarity and meaning of the original statement.

In summary, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of religious context, subject, specific details about the avatars, and the structure of the sentence.

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference in context**: The source text refers to ""लोकङ्गीत भित्रको"" (folklore within), which is a specific aspect of folk music, whereas the machine translation translates this as ""popular music within popular music,"" which is a broader and less specific term.

2. **Translation of ""भित्रको"":** The machine translation omits the word ""भित्रको"" (within), which is crucial for conveying the intended meaning that the study focuses on a particular aspect within folk music.

3. **Subject matter**: The source text uses ""लोकगीतलाई यस अध्ययनको विषय"" (the subject matter of this study), while the machine translation uses ""the subject matter of this study,"" which is a direct translation but loses the nuance of the original context.

4. **Reference translation**: The reference translation captures the essence of the source text by translating ""लोकङ्गीत भित्रको"" as ""folklore within"" and maintaining the focus on the study.

Source: सोही अवधिमा किरात धर्म तथा साहित्य उत्थान संघ २०३६ सालमा स्थापना भई झिनोरूपमा भाषा, धर्म, साहित्यको कार्य सुरूवात भयो।
Machine translation: During the same period, the kiryat religion and literature festival was established in 2036, initiating the work of the language, religion, and literature in zhino.

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The source text mentions ""सोही अवधिमा"" (specific time period), but the machine translation omits it.
- The source text uses ""संघ"" (organisation), while the machine translation uses ""festival.""
- The year is different: ""२०३६ सालमा"" in the source text is translated to ""2036"" in the machine translation.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""झinorूपमा"" (gradually) to ""in zhino.""

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: During the same period , Kirat Religion and Literature Reform Organisation was established in 1980 and initiated works on language , religion , literature gradualy started .

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The machine translation incorrectly sets the year as 2036 instead of 1980, as in the reference translation.
- The organisation type is different: ""संघ"" in the source is translated to ""Reform Organisation"" in the reference.
- The reference translation correctly includes the word ""gradually"" (झinorूपमा) to describe the initiation of work.

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in terms of the organisation type, year, and the word ""झinorूपमा"" which is crucial for conveying the intended meaning of the gradual start of the work.

1. **Source sentence structure**: The source sentence starts with ""सन् १९९४ को अप्रिल २७ का दिन"" (on April 27, 1994), which is a prepositional phrase indicating the date. The machine translation omits this phrase, making it less clear when the event occurred.

2. **""पहिलो बहुजातीय चुनावमा""**: The source mentions ""पहिलो"" (first) and ""बहुजातीय"" (multi-ethnic) together to describe the election. The machine translation separates these adjectives, which is not accurate in conveying the meaning.

3. **""पूर्ण मुक्ति प्रदान गरिएको थियो""**: The source uses ""पूर्ण मुक्ति"" (complete liberation) and ""थियो"" (was provided) to describe the event. The machine translation translates this as ""a full salvation"" and ""held"", which are not equivalent. The machine translation loses the sense of past tense and the specific meaning of ""complete liberation.""

4. **Sentence structure and word order**: The reference translation maintains a more natural and faithful word order, which is crucial for conveying the meaning accurately.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of preserving the original sentence structure, accurately conveying the meaning of ""complete liberation,"" and maintaining the correct tense. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text.

|Source: स्थानीय संस्कृति र तिनका अनुयायीहरुले यसलाई पवित्र मानेका छन् र बैध ठहर्याएका छन् ।|
|Machine translation: Local cultures and their followers have considered it holy and illegitimate.|
|Reference translation: Local culture and its followers have considered it sacred and legitimate.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Sanskrit words**: The machine translation uses ""holy"" (which is ""pavithra"" in Nepali) and ""illegitimate"" (which is ""baidha"" in Nepali), while the reference translation uses ""sacred"" (which is ""pavithra"" as well) and ""legitimate"". The difference here is that ""sacred"" is a more accurate translation for ""pavithra"" in this context, as it refers to religious or spiritual significance, while ""illegitimate"" does not fit the context, as the source text does not imply any illegality.

2. **Conjunction**: The source text uses ""र तिनका"" (and their) to connect ""स्थानीय संस्कृति"" (local culture) and ""अनुयायीहरुले"" (followers), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly omits this conjunction, as it is not necessary in English.

3. **Verb tense**: The source text uses the past tense ""ठहर्याएका छन्"" (have established), which is not explicitly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation omits this tense, as it is not necessary to convey the meaning in English, which can be understood as a general statement about the perception.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the choice of words (""illegitimate"" instead of ""sacred""), the conjunction, and the verb tense. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali text.

|Reference translation: After the freedom from jail, Chavez established a democratic socialist political party named the Fifth Republic Revolution.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""कारावास मुक्त"" (freedom from jail), which is not accurately translated as ""karawas freedom"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""freedom from jail.""
2. The machine translation omits the word ""नामक"" (named), which is important for understanding that the party's name is being discussed.
3. The machine translation refers to the party as ""the fifth Republic,"" while the reference translation specifies it as ""the Fifth Republic Revolution,"" which is a more accurate reflection of the context, as it implies a revolutionary movement.

|Thought 1: Analyzing the source text|
The source text is in Nepali and states that Britney released her seventh studio album called ""फेम फ्याटल"" in 2011, and it was released on June २९ (which is likely a typo, as March २९ is a more reasonable date for an album release).

|Thought 2: Comparing with machine translation|
The machine translation states that the album was released on June २९, which is incorrect. It also uses the phrase ""to return"" which is not directly present in the source text.

|Thought 3: Comparing with reference translation|
The reference translation correctly identifies the album title as ""Fame Fatal"" (note the difference in capitalization), and it mentions the correct release date of March 29, 2011.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation has differences in the release date (misinterpreting June as March) and the capitalization of the album title. The reference translation accurately captures the information from the source text, including the correct album title and release date. The quality of the machine translation could be improved by rectifying these errors.|im_end|

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: त्यसलाई सार्थक र मूल्यवान् तुल्याउन चाहेको देखिन्छ ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: It seems to be desirable to be careful and valuable.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: It is being tried to make meaningful and valuable.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""It seems to be"" which implies a subjective perception, while the reference translation uses ""It is being tried to make"" which suggests an active process or intention.
- The machine translation omits the word ""त्यसलाई"" (for that), which is important to indicate the subject of the action in the original sentence.
- The machine translation combines ""sārthak"" (meaningful) and ""mूल्यवान्"" (valuable) into a single phrase, while the reference separates them, making the meaning clearer.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the verb construction, the subject reference, and the separation of the adjectives. The reference translation better captures the intended meaning of the source text, reflecting the active attempt to make something meaningful and valuable, rather than just describing a perceived desirability.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
1. **Source Analysis**: The source text in Nepali describes a king named Narkasur who is described as ""नरकासुर"" (Narkasur), ""पतित"" (a husband), and ""व्याभिचारी"" (immoral or unethical). The context implies a negative character.

2. **Machine Translation Analysis**: The machine translation converts ""नरकासुर"" to ""Norcasur"" and changes the meaning of ""पतित"" to ""a husband and merchant."" It omits the negative qualities ""नरकासुर"" and ""व्याभिचारी"" and presents the king as a neutral figure.

3. **Reference Translation Analysis**: The reference translation captures the essence of the source by translating ""नरकासुर"" as ""Narkasur"" and adding the descriptive phrases ""inhuman"" and ""immoral"" to convey the negative character.

4. **Comparison**: The machine translation loses the negative connotations associated with the king's character, which are present in the source and reference translations. The reference translation also adds a more vivid description of the king's nature.

5. **Quality Evaluation**: The machine translation is not of high quality because it fails to accurately convey the negative aspects of the character and the context, which are crucial for understanding the story or message.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Identify the source text
The source text is ""काठमाडौं_काठमाण्डौॅ"" which refers to Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, followed by a mention of traffic police work and a name abbreviation (v. S.).

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation provided is ""[Wood_Woodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwoodwood]"", which does not resemble the content of the source text at all. It appears to be a series of repeated ""Wood"" words, which is unrelated to the context of Kathmandu traffic police.

Step 3: Compare the reference translation
The reference translation is ""After working as Traffice police in Kathmandu in … .B.S, he"", which conveys the meaning of someone who has worked in the traffic police force in Kathmandu and has a degree (B.S.).

Step 4: Analyze the differences
The machine translation completely misses the meaning of the source text. It does not translate the city name, the profession, or the abbreviation. Instead, it generates a nonsensical string of words that have no connection to the original context.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of poor quality and does not accurately reflect the meaning of the source text. It fails to capture the key elements such as the location, profession, and abbreviation, making it difficult to understand the intended message. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a clear and coherent translation.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: But the behavior explains the old rules, the old vowels and the old structure in the old price.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: But the behavior is transcending old rules, old values, and old structures.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation has a literal translation of ""नियम"" (rules) as ""old rules,"" which is accurate. However, it adds ""the old price"" which is not present in the source text.
- ""मूल्यमान्यतामा"" (values in the context of old price) is translated as ""the old vowels,"" which is a misunderstanding. The correct translation should be ""old values.""
- ""भावना"" (emotions or feelings) is not translated in the machine translation, which is a loss of information.
- ""संरचनालाई"" (with respect to structures) is translated as ""the old structure in the old price,"" which is again an incorrect interpretation. It should be translated as ""old structures.""

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- Incorrectly translating ""मूल्यमान्यतामा"" as ""old vowels.""
- Not translating ""भावना"" (emotions or feelings).
- Incorrectly interpreting ""संरचनालाई"" as ""the old structure in the old price"" instead of ""old structures.""

To improve the quality, the machine translation should be revised to: ""But the behavior transcends old rules, old values, and old structures.""

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Everything is a comparison to the Lord, and everything is a comparison to the Lord.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Each item should be consumed only after offering it to the god along with the basil leaves.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""Everything is a comparison to the Lord"" twice, which is a repetition and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""तुलसीपत्रका साथ"" (with basil leaves) as ""along with the basil leaves"" and emphasizes the action of offering before consumption.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation omits the specific action of offering (भोग लगाएर) and the context of consuming after the offering (मात्र आफूले सेवन गर्नु पर्छ).
- The repetition in the machine translation is not present in the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of losing the specific context of offering items to the god with basil leaves before consumption, and in the repetition of the phrase about everything being a comparison to the Lord.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: One day they decided to find out why the cow did not give milk.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation has ""worshipped"" (गाईले) which is a verb that implies praying or showing devotion, while the reference translation uses ""decided"" (निधो गरे) which means making a decision or resolving to do something.
- The machine translation uses ""didn't give milk"" (दूध दिइनन् भन्ने) which is a passive construction, while the reference translation uses ""did not give milk"" (did not give milk) in a more straightforward manner.
- The source text does not mention any act of worship, but rather suggests a question or inquiry about the cow's milk production.

Step 5: Conclusion

|Machine translation: These have also been varied in length, thickness, etc., according to the prevalence of serpents.|
|Reference translation: Depending on the species of snakes, their length, thickness, shape, etc. also vary.|

Analysis:
1. **Source meaning**: The sentence discusses the variation in length, thickness, etc. of something (presumably a reference to a creature or object) based on the different species of serpents.
2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation suggests that the variation is due to the prevalence of serpents, which is not the same as the species of serpents. The reference translation correctly uses ""species"" to describe the different types of snakes.
3. **Reference translation**: This translation accurately captures the source's meaning by stating that the variations are based on the different species of snakes and includes additional details like ""shape"" that were not mentioned in the source but are common in discussions of such variations.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:
- Incorrectly uses ""prevalence"" instead of ""species"" to describe the basis for variation.
- Omits the word ""आकारमा"" (shape) from the list of characteristics that vary, which is present in the source.

|Reference translation: When the Gorkhe Bazaar was in full swing, the main market of Premejung was the Gorkhe Bazaar.|

|Analysis|
1. **Timeframe difference**: The machine translation uses ""during the course of the gorkha market,"" which implies a continuous or ongoing period, while the reference translation specifies ""when the Gorkhe Bazaar was in full swing,"" which refers to a specific, temporary period of activity.
2. **Location difference**: The source text mentions ""प्रेमेजुङको मुख्य बजार"" (the main market of Premejung), but the machine translation incorrectly translates this to ""apajung,"" which is likely a typographical error or a misunderstanding of the context. The reference translation correctly uses ""Premejung.""
3. **Sentence structure**: The machine translation rephrases the sentence structure, which results in a less natural and accurate translation. The reference translation maintains a closer alignment with the original meaning.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of timeframe, location, and sentence structure, leading to a less accurate representation of the source text.

Step 2: Compare the subject and context
Source: ""यस हिसाबले"" (In this sense)
Machine translation: ""This hierarchy""
Reference translation: ""In this sense""

The machine translation has changed the context from ""in this sense"" to ""this hierarchy,"" which is not accurate.

Step 3: Compare the main subject
Source: ""महर्षि गौतम वैद्धिक"" (Maharishi Gautam Vedic)

Reference translation: What joy can we have by killing these sons of Dhritarashtra ?

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""the sons of the patriarch"" while the reference translation specifies ""Dhritarashtra's sons."" This is a crucial difference, as Dhritarashtra is a specific character in the context of the source text, which is likely from the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, where the term ""dhṛtarāṣṭra"" refers to a king and the sons are often mentioned in the context of a family or lineage.
- The word order is slightly different in the machine translation, which might affect the clarity of the meaning. The reference translation has a more natural flow, ""What joy can we have"" followed by the action.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of specificity (referring to ""Dhritarashtra's sons"" instead of ""the patriarch's sons"") and word order, which might affect the cultural and contextual understanding of the sentence.

The machine translation and the reference translation have a few differences:

1. Word order: In the source text, the name ""क्लाउड जोसेफ रूजेट डी लिस्ले"" is placed at the end, while in the machine translation, it is placed after ""This song"" and before the year. The reference translation follows a similar structure but with the name in quotes, which is a common way to present a composer's name in English.

2. Possessive form: The source text does not explicitly indicate possession, but the context suggests that ""क्लाउड जोसेफ रूजेट डी लिस्ले"" is the composer of the song. The machine translation translates this implied possession as ""is composed by,"" while the reference translation uses the possessive form ""by"" to express the same idea.

3. Quotation marks: The reference translation includes quotation marks around the composer's name, which is a standard practice in English to indicate a specific title or name.

Overall, the machine translation captures the essential information but with a slightly different word order and structure compared to the reference translation. The meaning is clear in both, but the reference translation is more idiomatic and adheres more closely to the typical English sentence structure.

The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of context, missing the word ""त्यस्तै"" (therefore) and the correct translation of ""पदमार्ग"" (hiking trail). The structure and punctuation also differ, making the meaning less clear. The quality of the translation could be improved by capturing the meaning and context of the source text more accurately.

|im_start|>|im_sep| Step 1: Understand the source text
The source text in Nepali says, ""खप्तडी भनेर नाम जोडीएकाहरुको मूल थलो यही खप्तडलाई मानिन्छ ।"" This sentence talks about the association of a name with Khaptadi and how it is considered the place of origin for people with that connection.

|im_sep| Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation states, ""The root thickness of those who have a name joined is considered to be the same thickness."" This translation seems to have misunderstood the context, as it talks about ""root thickness"" instead of the place of origin and incorrectly translates ""खप्तडी भनेर नाम जोडीएकाहरुको मूल थलो"" (the place of origin of those with a name related to Khaptadi) as ""the root thickness.""

|im_sep| Step 3: Compare with the reference translation
The reference translation, ""Khaptad is considered the place of origin of those whose name is related to Khaptadi,"" accurately conveys the meaning of the source text by specifying that Khaptad is the place associated with the names.

|im_sep| Conclusion:
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of context and meaning. It incorrectly translates the place of origin into a concept of root thickness, while the reference translation correctly captures the relationship between the name and Khaptadi as the place of origin.

|Machine translation: The Northern Falguni is the twelfth of the northern falguni.|
|Reference translation: Uttara Falguni consellation is the twelfth constellation.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Translation of the source text**: The source text talks about ""उत्तरा फाल्गुनी नक्षत्रमण्डल"" (Uttara Falguni constellation) and its position as ""बाह्रौं नक्षत्र"" (the twelfth constellation).

2. **Machine translation error**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""नक्षत्रमण्डलको"" (of the constellation) as ""the twelfth of the northern falguni"", which is redundant and does not convey the intended meaning. It should simply say ""of"" or ""constellation"" without specifying the ""northern falguni"" again.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation correctly captures the meaning by stating ""Uttara Falguni consellation is the twelfth constellation,"" which is clear and concise.

4. **Improvement**: The machine translation could be improved by removing the unnecessary repetition and maintaining the clarity of the source text, like this: ""Uttara Falguni is the twelfth constellation.""

|im_start|>|im_sep| Analyzing the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. **Source text**: ""त्यहीँबाट २०३७ सालमा सात कक्षा उत्तीर्ण गर्नुभयो"" - This sentence in Nepali means ""From there, in the year 2037, they completed seven classes.""

2. **Machine translation**: ""Seven classes achieved by that same 2037 s."" - The machine translation has a few issues:
   a. ""that same 2037 s"" is not a proper phrase; it should be ""2037 BS"" (Baisakha Samvat, the Nepali calendar system).
   b. ""achieved by"" is not the most accurate translation for ""उत्तीर्ण गर्नुभयो"" (which means ""completed"" or ""finished"").

3. **Reference translation**: ""From there, in 2037 BS he passed class seven."" - This translation captures the meaning more accurately:
   a. It maintains the context of ""from there"" (त्यहीँबाट).
   b. ""2037 BS"" is correctly used to represent the Nepali calendar.
   c. ""passed class seven"" is a suitable translation for ""उत्तीर्ण गर्नुभयो"" and conveys the completion of the seventh class.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of calendar representation and the verb choice for ""completing"" the classes. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Identify the key elements in the source text
- Subject: बौद्ध धर्मका प्रवर्तक (Gautama Buddha, the Buddhist practitioner)
- Action: आफ्नो अन्तिम दिनहरूमा यहाँबाट गएका (left here in his last days)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: The Prominent Gautama Buddha (Subject is slightly altered, ""Prominent"" is not in the source)
- Reference translation: Gautama Buddha (Correct subject, founder of Buddhism)
- Machine translation: went from here (Accurate)
- Reference translation: had gone from here (Past tense, more natural in English, but still accurate)
- Machine translation: in his last days (Accurate)

Step 3: Analyze the differences
- The main difference is the addition of ""Prominent"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the source text. The source simply refers to Gautama Buddha without specifying his prominence.
- The reference translation correctly identifies Gautama Buddha as the founder of Buddhism, which is a crucial piece of context.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the description of Gautama Buddha as ""Prominent"" and the lack of mention of his role as the founder of Buddhism. The rest of the sentence structure and action are accurately translated. To improve the quality, the machine translation should maintain the founder's status and avoid unnecessary adjectives like ""Prominent.""

|Source: स्तुति आदि पद्यमा अन्य छन्दको पनि प्रयोग गरिएको छ यसको प्रथम अध्यायमा अर्जुनले खेद व्यक्त गरेको हुनाले अर्जुन विषादयोग अध्याय भनिएको छ ।|
|Machine translation: Praise et parsonage has also been used in other issues in its first chapter called the argus poetic chapter because argus pursued poetry in its first chapter.|
|Reference translation: Other verses are also used in the paragraphs like Stuti. As Arjuna expressed regret in the first chapter, it is called Arjuna Vishadyoga chapter.|
|Analysis:|
1. **""स्तुति आदि पद्यमा""** (Praise et parsonage) - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""स्तुति आदि"" (Stuti and other verses) as ""Praise et parsonage"". The reference translation correctly identifies Stuti as a type of verse.
2. **""अन्य छन्दको पनि प्रयोग""** (Other verses' usage) - The machine translation omits this part, which is crucial for understanding the context of other verses being used.
3. **""अर्जुनले खेद व्यक्त गरेको हुनाले""** (Because Arjuna expressed regret) - The machine translation incorrectly attributes the pursuit of poetry to ""argus"" instead of ""Arjuna"" as in the reference translation.
4. **""अर्जुन विषादयोग अध्याय""** (Arjuna Vishadyoga chapter) - The machine translation does not capture the connection between Arjuna's regret and the chapter name, which is ""Arjuna Vishadyoga"" in both the source and reference.

In summary, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of accurately representing the source text, specifically in the identification of Stuti, the connection to Arjuna's expression of regret, and the chapter's name. The reference translation provides a clearer and more faithful translation.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: In this case, there is no duty of wealth and experience with the government.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In this case, there is no lack of wealth and splendor with the newborn.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation has ""duty of wealth and experience"" which does not match the source text's meaning. The source text talks about ""धनदौलथ"" (wealth) and ""वैभव"" (splendor or glory), not a duty.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""जातकसँग"" (with the newborn) as ""with the newborn,"" while the machine translation omits this context, which is important for understanding the meaning.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""dhana"" (wealth) as ""duty"" and omits the context of ""jātakasang"" (with the newborn).
- The reference translation captures the intended meaning of the source text, while the machine translation does not.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality due to the incorrect interpretation of ""dhana"" and the lack of context provided by ""jātakasang."" The reference translation better reflects the meaning of the source text.

|Reference translation: This led to the decline of absolute monarchies around the world , the establishment of new republics and liberal democracies.|

Analysis:
1. **Difference in meaning**: The machine translation omits the key term ""निरपेक्ष राजतन्त्रमा"" (absolute monarchies) from the source, which is crucial to understanding the context. Instead, it translates it as ""a new Republic & enterprise democracy,"" which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly captures this as ""absolute monarchies.""

2. **Lack of nuance**: The source mentions ""भयो"" (fear or consequence), which implies a negative outcome. The machine translation does not convey this sense of decline or fear, while the reference translation does.

3. **Word order and structure**: The machine translation rearranges the sentence structure, making it less natural and harder to follow. The reference translation maintains a more direct and clear translation.

|Machine translation: Tamangs do not hate gonmas as their constituents and cannot be solidified that they are eaten by all.|
|Reference translation: The Tamangs do not hate Gonmas according to their concepts and it cannot be confirmed that everyone eats them.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Conceptual difference**: The machine translation states that Tamangs do not hate gonmas as their constituents, which implies that they might consider gonmas as part of their identity. However, the reference translation suggests that the Tamangs do not hate gonmas based on their concepts, which could mean their beliefs or understanding, without necessarily linking it to their identity.

2. **Verb translation**: The phrase ""घृणा गर्दैनन्"" in the source is translated as ""do not hate"" in the machine translation, which is correct. However, the reference translation uses ""hate"" as well but with a different nuance, implying a lack of dislike rather than a positive acceptance.

3. **Solidification and confirmation**: The machine translation uses ""cannot be solidified"" and ""eaten by all,"" which are not directly equivalent to the source's ""ठोकुवा गर्न पनि सकिँदैन"" (it cannot be confirmed). The reference translation captures the idea of uncertainty or lack of confirmation more accurately.

4. **Sentence structure**: The machine translation rephrases the sentence structure, which affects the flow and readability. The reference translation maintains a more natural and direct translation.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the interpretation of concepts, the nuance of the verb ""hate,"" and the sentence structure, leading to a less accurate representation of the original Nepali text.

2. **Lack of context**: The machine translation does not convey the forced nature of working as wage laborers and watchmen, which is implied in the reference translation.

**Analysis:**

1. **""कतिपय सम्पन्न व्यक्तिले""** (Many wealthy people) - Machine translation: ""Some of the completed persons"" is not an accurate translation. ""Completed persons"" does not convey the meaning of wealthy individuals.
2. **""जुत्ता""** (shoes) - Correctly translated.
3. **""छाता""** (umbrella) - Machine translation: ""leather"" is incorrect. The reference translation uses ""umbrella"" which is more appropriate.
4. **""ठूलो रूमाल""** (big handkerchiefs) - Machine translation: ""large ruins"" is a literal and incorrect translation. ""रूमाल"" means handkerchief, and ""ठूलो"" means big, so ""big handkerchiefs"" is accurate in the reference translation.
5. **""कम्बल""** (blankets) - Correctly translated.
6. **""पनि दान गर्छन्""** (donate) - Machine translation: ""also dress"" is not correct. The verb ""दान गर्छन्"" means ""donate,"" which is present in the reference translation.

In summary, the machine translation has several inaccuracies, including the interpretation of ""completed persons"" as wealthy, ""leather"" instead of ""umbrella,"" and ""large ruins"" instead of ""big handkerchiefs."" The correct translation should convey the idea that wealthy individuals donate various items, which is more accurately represented in the reference translation.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the machine translation, ""काट्लेगो फेला म्यान"" is translated as ""Findman,"" which is a name, but in the source text, it seems to be a compound name or a title, possibly referring to a player's full name or a nickname.

- The machine translation omits the phrase ""दि म्याच"" (of the match), which is crucial to convey the context that Katlego was declared as the best player for the game.
- The reference translation includes the phrase ""the Man of the Match,"" which is a standard term in sports to describe the standout player of a game, while the machine translation does not.

|Reference translation: One day, all the gopinis gathered at Yashoda's house and complained to Yashoda about Krishna stealing butter.|

|Analysis|
1. **Time expression**: The machine translation uses ""it came to pass"" which is a more formal and literal translation of ""यसरी दिन दिनै"" (day by day), while the reference translation simplifies it to ""One day"".
2. **Action**: The machine translation states ""Makhan was stolen"" without specifying who did it, while the reference translation adds ""complained to Yashoda about Krishna"" to clarify the context.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""सबै गोपीहरू"" (all the Gopis), which refers to a group of women devotees in the context of Lord Krishna's life in the Hindu epic, the Ramayana. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""all the priesthood,"" which is a misinterpretation of the term and does not convey the religious group of women.

2. The verb ""लिएर गए"" (took and went) in the source text implies an action of taking Shree Krishna to Yashoda's house. The machine translation omits this action and simply states that they ""came to Mr. Jeshoda's house,"" which does not reflect the intended meaning.

3. The name ""श्रीकृष्णलाई"" (to Shree Krishna) is not translated in the machine translation, which results in a loss of context and specificity.

4. The reference translation correctly uses ""Yashoda's house"" instead of ""Mr. Jeshoda's house,"" which is a more accurate translation of the original source.

|Reference translation: The next day , early in the morning while all persons of that house had been eating their food , the King woke up.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Time frame**: The machine translation incorrectly implies that the king woke up and ate all the people in the house, which is a nonsensical event. The reference translation correctly states that it happened ""the next day, early in the morning"" after the people had already been eating their food.

|Source: स्त्रीहरूले देवीको शीरमा सिंदूर चढाउँछन् र देवीलाई आँशु झार्दै विदाई दिन्छन्।|
|Machine translation: The women sacrifice the lion in the shire of the goddess, and vacation the goddess with fear.|
|Reference translation: The women offer vermilion on the goddess's forehead and bid her farewell with tears.|

|Analysis|
1. **Sacrifice vs Offering**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""सिंदूर चढाउँछन्"" (offer vermilion) as ""sacrifice the lion"", which is a misinterpretation of the context. The correct action is offering vermilion, not sacrificing a lion.
2. **Shire vs Forehead**: ""शीरमा"" (forehead) is not translated accurately. The machine translation refers to a ""shire"" which is unrelated to the forehead in this context.
3. **Fear vs Tears**: ""देवीलाई आँशु झार्दै"" (with tears) is translated as ""vacation the goddess with fear"" in the machine translation, which is a misinterpretation of the emotional farewell. The correct translation is a farewell with tears, not fear.

|Source: यदि हालैमा रोग पहिचान नगरिएको मामलाहरू शामिल गरियो भने 25 लाख मानिसहरूलाई COPD हुन सक्छ।|
|Machine translation: If the disease is not recognized in recent times, 25 million people may be COPD.|
|Reference translation: If matters relating to idenfication disease in recent time is not recognized , 2.5 million people may suffer from COPD.|

|Analysis|
1. **""यदि हालैमा""** (If recently) - Machine translation: ""If the disease is not recognized in recent times"" - The source uses ""हालैमा"" which is a more colloquial way of saying ""recently"", while the machine translation uses ""in recent times"" which is a more formal equivalent.
2. **""रोग पहिचान""** (disease identification) - Machine translation: ""the disease is not recognized"" - The source combines ""रोग"" (disease) and ""पहिचान"" (identification) into one phrase, while the machine translation separates them.
3. **""नगरिएको मामलाहरू""** (cases in the community) - Machine translation: Not directly translated - The source refers to ""cases in the community"" but the machine translation omits this context.
4. **""शामिल गरियो""** (include women) - Machine translation: Not translated - The source implies that women are included, but the machine translation does not mention this.
5. **""25 लाख""** (25 million) - Machine translation: ""25 million"" - Both translations convey the same number.
6. **""मानिसहरूलाई COPD हुन सक्छ""** (people may have COPD) - Machine translation: ""may be COPD"" - Both translations convey the possibility of people having COPD, but the machine translation omits the subject ""mānisaharu"" (people).

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its handling of the colloquial phrase ""हालैमा"", the combined concept of ""रोग पहिचान"", and the inclusion of women. Additionally, the context of ""cases in the community"" is not clearly conveyed in the machine translation. The numbers are the same, but the overall meaning and nuance are not fully captured.

Step 1: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- सामान्यता (usually)
- २ देखि ३ हप्तामा (2 to 3 weeks)
- यो ट्रेलको (this trail)
- एउटा भागमा (a part of)
- पदयात्रा (walking)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""Normality 2 to 3 weeks can be traced to a part of this trail.""
- Reference translation: ""It is usually possible to walk a part of this trail in 2 to 3 weeks.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""सामान्यता"" as ""Normality"" (which is a noun, not a verb for ""usually"" in this context), making the sentence structure awkward.
- The verb ""गर्न सकिन्छ"" (can be done) is not present in the machine translation, which affects the meaning of the sentence.
- The phrase ""यो ट्रेलको एउटा भागमा"" is translated as ""a part of this trail"" in both, but the reference translation places it after ""walk a part of,"" which is more natural.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation due to the incorrect handling of the verb ""सामान्यता"" and the lack of the verb ""गर्न सकिन्छ,"" which affects the meaning and fluency of the sentence. The structure of the sentence could also be improved by placing ""a part of this trail"" after ""walk"" as in the reference translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
The source text is in Nepali and says, ""विवाह र बैवाहिक सम्बन्धः प्रकृति, विविधता र परिवर्तन""

Step 2: Read the machine translation
The machine translation provided is ""Marriage and bankruptcy: Nature, diversity and change""

Step 3: Read the reference translation
The reference translation is ""Marriage and marital relation : Nature , Diversity and Changes""

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation has ""bankruptcy"" which is not present in the source text. This is a significant difference, as the source is discussing marriage and its related aspects, not bankruptcy.
- The machine translation uses ""and"" between ""marriage"" and ""bankruptcy,"" which is not accurate, as the source text does not mention bankruptcy at all.
- The machine translation uses ""relation"" instead of ""सम्बन्धः"" (sambandha), which is the Nepali term for ""relation"" or ""connection.""
- The machine translation omits the colon (:) after ""marriage"" in the reference translation, which is a minor formatting difference but still important for clarity.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of content (mentioning bankruptcy, which is not in the source) and accuracy (using ""relation"" instead of the correct Nepali term). The structure and formatting are also slightly different. The quality of the translation could be improved by focusing on the accurate representation of the source text's meaning without introducing unrelated concepts.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: यसैगरी घानाका जोनाथन मेन्सा, ली एडी र एन्थोनी अनानले पनि पहेंलो कार्ड पाए।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Since Jonathan Mensah of Ghana, Lee Addy and Anthony Anan also received a yellow card.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Likewise, Ghana's Jonathan Mensa, Lee Eddy and Anthony Annan also received yellow cards.

Step 4: Compare the differences
1. The machine translation uses ""Since"" which is not present in the source text. The source text does not imply a cause or reason, but rather a parallel statement.
2. The machine translation omits the possessive form ""घानाका"" (of Ghana) in front of ""जोनाथन मेन्सा,"" which is present in the reference translation. This is important for clarity as it specifies that Jonathan Mensah is from Ghana.
3. The machine translation has ""Lee Addy"" instead of ""ली एडी"" (Lee Eddy), which is a name difference and might be a mistranslation or a typographical error.
4. The machine translation has ""Anthony Anan"" without the possessive form ""अनानले"" (Annan's), which is again important for clarity.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of structure, clarity, and the inclusion of possessive forms. The source text is more concise and does not require a cause, while the reference translation provides additional context with the possessive forms. The name ""Lee Addy"" might be a mistake, and the overall meaning is not significantly altered, but the differences are noticeable.

|Reference translation: Thus for a person who is satisfied with Krishna consciousness, all the three kinds of material sufferings in the world do not last long.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""कृष्णभावनामा सन्तुष्ट"" (satisfied with Krishna consciousness), which is a specific concept. The machine translation omits this context, referring to ""the potential"" instead, which is a general term and does not convey the same meaning.
2. The reference translation specifies ""तीनै किसिमका"" (three kinds of), which is crucial to understanding the variety of material sufferings. The machine translation does not include this detail, making it unclear about the number or types of physical troubles.
3. The reference translation uses ""all"" (कुल) to emphasize that none of these sufferings last long for the satisfied person, which is not present in the machine translation.

In summary, the machine translation loses the specific context of Krishna consciousness and the variety of material sufferings, making it less accurate compared to the reference translation.

|Reference translation: Sultan Adil Shah of Bijapur withdrew his army from many forts and handed it over to the local rulers or feudal lords.|

|Analysis|
1. **""धेरै दुर्गहरुदेखि""** (many forts) vs. ""many disturbances"" - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""दुर्गहरुदेखि"" as ""disturbances"" instead of forts, which is a key part of the context.
2. **""सेना हटाएर""** (removed his army) vs. ""removed his army"" - The meaning is the same, but the word order is slightly different in the machine translation.
3. **""तिनलाई""** (to them) vs. ""him"" - The machine translation omits the indirect object ""तिनलाई"" (to them), which is important for understanding who the army was given to.
4. **""स्थानीय शासकुन्""** (local rulers) vs. ""local rulers or materials"" - The machine translation incorrectly adds ""materials"" which is not present in the source text.
5. **""वा सामन्तहरुका""** (or feudal lords) - This part is missing in the machine translation, which is crucial for the context as it specifies the type of local rulers.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific details and context, particularly regarding the forts and the type of local rulers. The translation should be revised to accurately convey the meaning of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: स्वयं भगवानले के भन्नु भएको छ भने कामिका व्रतबाट जीव कुयोनिमा पुग्दैन।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Self-the goddess doesn't reach the living kuyonima from kamika betrayal.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The God Himself has said that the creature does not reach Kuyoni from Kamika Vrata.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the source text, ""स्वयं भगवान"" refers to ""The God Himself"" (the deity is the subject), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""Self-the goddess"" (implying a goddess is the subject).
- The verb ""भन्नु भएको"" means ""has said"" in Nepali, but the machine translation omits this part, making it unclear who is saying something.
- ""छ भने"" is a phrase that adds emphasis or repetition, which is lost in the machine translation.
- ""कामिका व्रतबाट"" means ""from kamika betrayal,"" but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""from kamika betrayal"" without the context of the vow.
- ""जीव कुयोनिमा पुग्दैन"" means ""the creature does not reach Kuyoni,"" which is accurately translated in the reference translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of subject, verb, and context. It incorrectly attributes the statement to a goddess instead of the God, omits the verb ""भन्नु भएको,"" and does not convey the emphasis or repetition in ""छ भने."" Additionally, it lacks the context of the kamika vow in the translation. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original source text.

|Reference translation: During those time, the students who studied in this school were sons and nephews of Junga Bahadur, among whom the number of sons of his brother Dhirsumsher was even more.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""त्यसताका यस स्कूलमा पढ्ने विद्यार्थीहरु"" (students who studied in that school), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""The students who read at this school of theology."" The reference translation correctly captures the context of students studying, not just reading.
2. The source mentions ""जङ्गबहादुरका छोरा भतिजाहरु"" (sons of Jung Bahadur), which the machine translation translates as ""the vultures of the son of Jung."" This is a literal and incorrect interpretation, while the reference translation correctly translates it as ""sons and nephews.""
3. The phrase ""उनका भाइ धीरशमशेरका छोराहरुकै संख्या बढी थियो"" (the number of his brother Dhirsumsher's sons increased) is not accurately translated in the machine translation, which omits the context of the number increasing.

|Reference translation: It is mentioned in the inscription of the temple that the construction of the temple was done in 1882 AD.|

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""मन्दिरको निमार्ण सम्बत"" which means ""with respect to the construction of the temple"". The machine translation omits this context, making it unclear that the mention is specifically about the construction.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""भएको"" (constructed) as ""which was inaugurated"", which is not accurate. The correct translation should be ""that was constructed"" or ""built"".
3. The reference translation correctly includes ""inscription"" (शिलापत्रमा) and specifies that it's the ""inscription of the temple"" (देखेको शिलापत्रमा).
4. The machine translation omits ""AD"" (Anno Domini) from the year 1882, which is a common practice in Nepali-English translations to avoid confusion, but the reference translation includes it for clarity.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: यी जन्जिरबाट मुक्ति पाउनको लागि एक मात्र तरिका छ कि हामी प्राकृतिक आदिम अवस्था व्यवस्थामा फर्कौ ।
Machine translation: Only one way to get rid of these births is that we return to the natural etymological conditions.

Step 2: Identify differences between the two translations.
- ""जन्जिरबाट"" (chains) in the source is translated as ""these births"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate.
- ""मुक्ति पाउनको"" (to get rid of) is translated as ""get rid of"" in a more direct but less idiomatic manner.
- ""प्राकृतिक आदिम अवस्था"" (natural primitive state) is translated as ""natural etymological conditions"", which is a different interpretation, as ""अवस्था"" can also refer to a state or condition, not necessarily etymological.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: The only way to get rid of these chains is to return to the natural primitive state system.

- ""जन्जिरबाट"" (chains) is correctly translated as ""these chains"" in the reference.
- ""मुक्ति पाउनको"" (to get rid of) is translated similarly, but with ""chains"" instead of ""births.""
- ""प्राकृतिक आदिम अवस्था व्यवस्थामा"" is translated as ""natural primitive state system,"" which is a more accurate and idiomatic translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific word choice and interpretation of ""जन्जिरबाट"" (chains), ""मुक्ति पाउनको"" (to get rid of), and the overall structure. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuance of the original Nepali text.

|Source: त्यो बाण माछाको पेटमा भेटिएको मुशलको टुक्राबाट बनेको हुनाले कृष्णको मृत्यु त्यसै बाणबाट भयो ।|
|Machine translation: Because the arrow was made out of a piece of mushroom found in the fish's belly, the death of the arrow came from the same fish.|
|Reference translation: Since that arrow was made of a piece of Mushal found in the stomach of a fish, Krishna died from the same arrow.|

Analysis:
1. The source text uses ""मुशलको टुक्राबाट"" (a piece of Mushal), which refers to a specific type of wood or material, while the machine translation uses ""a piece of mushroom,"" which is a different entity. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""a piece of Mushal.""
2. The source text uses ""भेटिएको"" (given or placed), which implies the placement of the Mushal piece, while the machine translation omits this aspect. The reference translation includes it with ""found in the stomach.""
3. The source text uses ""त्यसै बाणबाट"" (from that arrow), which indicates the cause of death, while the machine translation incorrectly suggests that the death of the arrow (not Krishna) came from the fish. The reference translation correctly states ""Krishna died from the same arrow.""
4. The source text uses ""भयो"" (caused fear), which is not directly translated in the machine translation, but the context implies fear or consequence. The reference translation omits this part, but it's not a significant error since it's not directly stated in the source.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific material (Mushal vs. mushroom), the placement of the material (omitted in the machine translation), and the interpretation of the cause of death (Krishna's death vs. the death of the arrow). The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the nuances of the source text.

|Machine translation: Each male members of the yogi government have traditional assignments to be fucked once again by fucking mandatory in life.|
|Reference translation: There is a customary belief that male member of Jogi community has to once again in life time compulsorily move around by fukera.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""जोगी जातिका"" (Jogi community), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""yogi government,"" which is a misinterpretation of the context.
2. The phrase ""हरेक पुरुष सदस्यहरूले"" (each male member) is translated as ""Each male members"" in the machine translation, but it should be ""each male member"" without the ""s"" at the end, as it is singular in Nepali.
3. The phrase ""जीवनमा अनिवार्य रुपमा"" (in an inevitable manner) is translated as ""by fucking mandatory in life,"" which is not a suitable translation. It should convey the idea of something being a part of tradition or custom, not a forced act.
4. The phrase ""एक पटक फेरी फुकेर"" (a round of movement) is translated as ""to be fucked once again,"" which is a literal and inappropriate translation. The reference translation uses ""move around"" (फुकेर) to convey the idea of a circular movement, which is more accurate.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of context, word choice, and cultural appropriateness. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuance of the original Nepali text.

|Machine translation: Brahmins must be methodically flammable and golden dressing by snakes in the prevailing days of tertiary dressing.|
|Reference translation: During the morning on the day of Tadanantar Dwadashi, the Brahmins should be ritually donated water and ornaments after taking a bath.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text discusses a specific ritual (स्नान गरेर ब्राह्मणहरूलाई विधिपूर्वक जल र सुवर्ण दान) that takes place during a particular day (द्वादशीका दिन) and time (प्रभातकालमा).
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""विधिपूर्वक"" (ritually) as ""methodically flammable"" and ""जल र सुवर्ण दान"" (water and ornaments) as ""golden dressing by snakes"" and ""tertiary dressing,"" which are not accurate concepts in this context.

|Machine translation: Bhagwan Sriram made a military of debtors and many forests in wanwas with sita and lakshmi.|
|Reference translation: During forest-stay, Lord Rama, along with Sita and Lakshmana, visited the sages' ashrams and many forest areas.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text talks about ""वनवासमा"" (forest-stay), which refers to the period when Lord Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana lived in the forest. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""made a military of debtors"" and ""in wanwas"", which is a misunderstanding of the context.
2. The phrase ""ऋषीहरूका आश्रम"" (sages' ashrams) is not translated accurately. The machine translation omits this part, while the reference translation includes it, correctly conveying the visit to the sages.
3. ""धेरै जंगलहरूको सैर गरे"" (and many forest areas) is translated as ""and many forests"" in the machine translation, but it misses the verb ""सैर गरे"" (made a journey or visited), which is crucial for understanding the action. The reference translation includes this part, making it clear that they visited many forest areas.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of context, the mention of sages' ashrams, and the action of visiting forest areas. The quality of the translation is poor due to these inaccuracies.

|Machine translation: Many International Communities across the world demonstrated blaming the attack.|
|Reference translation: Many international communities protested criticising the attack.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference in verb**: The machine translation uses ""demonstrated blaming"" while the reference translation uses ""protested criticising."" The verb ""protested"" more accurately conveys the act of expressing disapproval or disagreement, whereas ""demonstrated blaming"" suggests a focus on the act of blaming rather than the act itself.

2. **Missing verb**: The reference translation includes the verb ""criticising"" which is essential to convey the idea that the communities are not only protesting but also expressing their criticism of the attack. The machine translation omits this verb, making the meaning less clear.

3. **Word order**: The word order in the machine translation is slightly different, with ""blaming the attack"" following ""demonstrated."" In the reference translation, ""criticising the attack"" comes after ""protested,"" which is more natural and consistent with the original Nepali sentence.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of verb choice, missing a crucial verb, and word order, which affects the clarity and accuracy of the meaning conveyed. The reference translation better captures the intended meaning of the source text.

|Reference translation: Therefore, when the latest research journal is included in the study, its technical aspects are also known.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text is discussing a ""नयां शोध पत्रिका"" (new research journal), not a ""sorority magazine"" as the machine translation suggests. This is a significant difference.
2. The machine translation uses ""technical aspects"" without specifying that it refers to the journal, while the reference translation correctly connects it to the context of the study.
3. The phrase ""त्यसका प्राविधिक पक्षहरुबारे पनि जानकारी हुन्छ"" (information about its technical side) is translated as ""its technical aspects are also known"" in the reference, which maintains the meaning of knowing the technical details.

|Reference translation: From the year 2050 to the present, the construction of 37 jhulunge bridges have been completed.|

Analysis:
1. The source text uses ""झulungे"" which refers to ""bridges"" in Nepali, but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""broad bridges"" (which is not a direct translation). The reference translation correctly uses ""jhulunge"" to convey the same meaning.
2. The source text uses ""निर्माण कार्य"" which means ""construction work"" or ""construction project,"" while the machine translation omits this context, simply saying ""the construction of."" The reference translation includes ""jhulunge bridges"" to provide the context of what is being constructed.
3. The source text uses ""हालसम्म"" which means ""up to now"" or ""present,"" but the machine translation omits this phrase, making the translation less clear about the time frame. The reference translation includes ""the present"" to maintain the same meaning.

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""योग"" (yoga) with a specific name, ""विजय"" (victory), which is not translated accurately in the machine translation. The machine translation interprets it as ""the sum of the victims,"" which is a completely different concept.
2. The machine translation uses ""incremental"" to describe the effect of the yoga, which does not convey the intended meaning of the source text. The reference translation uses ""perfect"" to describe the yoga's suitability for all actions, which aligns better with the original context.
3. The structure of the sentence is also altered in the machine translation, with the focus on the victims rather than the yoga itself.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of the meaning and context, particularly in the interpretation of ""yoga"" and the description of its qualities. The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately.

3. **Reference translation**: And proved that the minimum point of only one short-term average cost line touches minimum point of the long-term average cost line.

**Analysis**:
- The machine translation has a slight difference in the interpretation of ""अल्पकालीन"" (short-term) and ""दीर्घकालीन"" (long-term). The machine translation uses ""shorter"" which is not entirely accurate, as it implies a quantitative comparison rather than the temporal distinction.
- The reference translation correctly separates the concepts of ""short-term average cost line"" and ""long-term average cost line"" with ""only one"" and ""minimum point.""
- The phrase ""स्पर्श गर्छ भन्ने कुरा प्रमाणित गरे"" (proven that it touches) is translated as ""touches the minimum point of"" in both translations, but the reference translation omits the verb ""proven"" for brevity.

|Reference translation: This temple with a two-storey entrance on the east side has a birthing home on the floor below while a general box is placed on the south.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference in meaning**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""पूर्व पट्टि प्रवेशद्धार"" (east side entrance) as ""a simple foundation petition"" instead of referring to the entrance. It also adds the concept of ""pollution"" which is not present in the source text.

2. **Misinterpretation of ""गर्भ गृह""**: The machine translation translates this as ""a womb on the lower floor,"" which is not accurate. It should be translated as ""birthing home"" or ""a place for childbirth.""

3. **Incorrect placement of ""सामान्य आधार पेटिका""**: The machine translation incorrectly places this phrase, which means ""general box,"" on the east side. The reference translation states that it is placed on the south.

4. **Lack of clarity**: The machine translation is less clear and concise than the reference translation, which affects the overall quality of the translation.

Step 1: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text
- तीनवटा चरण (three stages)
- राशी (zodiac sign)
- बृश्चिक (Scorpio)
- अन्तिम चरण (final stage)
- पर्दछ (ending or under)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""If its three steps are under the trumpet rashi, the final step is under the trumpet rashi.""
- Reference translation: ""Its three stages are under Libra and the last stage is under Scorpio.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""बृश्चिक"" (Scorpio) as ""trumpet rashi,"" which is not a correct zodiac sign term in English. The correct term for Libra in Nepali is ""राशी"" (rashi), but it is not specified as ""trumpet"" in the reference translation.
- The reference translation correctly identifies the final stage as being under ""Scorpio"" (बृश्चिक), while the machine translation incorrectly refers to both the three steps and the final step as being under the same zodiac sign.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality due to the incorrect identification of the zodiac signs, specifically confusing ""बृश्चिक"" (Scorpio) with ""trumpet rashi."" The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text in terms of the zodiac signs.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
The source text in Nepali is: ""कसैका लागि पर्यटन मनोरञ्जन हो भने कसैका लागि अध्ययन र अनुसन्धान""

Step 2: Read the machine translation
The machine translation provided is: ""Studies and research for someone who is a tourism entertainer.""

Step 3: Read the reference translation
The reference translation is: ""For some , tourism is entertainment while for others , study and research""

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation suggests that the studies and research are specifically for a person who is a tourism entertainer, which is a narrow interpretation of the source text.
- The reference translation, on the other hand, presents a broader perspective, indicating that tourism can be both an entertainment and a subject of study and research for different people.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation misses the nuance that the source text implies that tourism can be experienced differently by different individuals, with some finding it entertaining and others engaging in research.
- The reference translation captures this duality more accurately.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it focuses on a specific role (tourism entertainer) for studies and research, while the reference translation acknowledges the diverse ways people perceive and engage with tourism. The machine translation could be improved by being more inclusive and capturing the broader context of the source text.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Mcmain was not a WWF Team present until 2000.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Mcmain had not mentioned his presence in the WWF Team until 2000.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation states that Mcmain ""was not a WWF Team present until 2000,"" which implies that he was not part of the team at all until that time.
- The reference translation, on the other hand, says that Mcmain ""had not mentioned his presence in the WWF Team until 2000,"" which suggests that he might have been part of the team but did not publicly acknowledge or discuss it until 2000.

Step 5: Identify the issue
The main difference lies in the interpretation of Mcmain's involvement in the WWF Team. The machine translation implies a lack of physical presence, while the reference translation suggests a lack of public acknowledgment or mention.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it implies a more definitive absence from the team, whereas the reference translation allows for the possibility that Mcmain was part of the team but simply hadn't disclosed it until 2000. The quality of the translation could be improved by capturing the nuance of the reference text, which indicates a lack of public disclosure rather than a complete absence.

1. The machine translation has a minor grammatical difference: it uses ""which reference books"" without the article ""the"" before ""reference books."" In the reference translation, the article ""the"" is included, which is more natural in English.
2. The punctuation is slightly different: the machine translation has a comma after ""distribution,"" while the reference translation uses a full stop followed by a comma. This difference is minor and does not significantly affect the meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor grammatical difference and a punctuation variation. The core meaning is the same, and the difference is likely due to minor adjustments in English syntax. The quality of the translation can be considered good, but the inclusion of ""the"" in the reference translation makes it slightly more natural.

Analysis:

2. **""भौतिकता""**: The source uses ""भौतिकता"" (materiality) which is not translated accurately as ""physiology"" in the machine translation. The correct term should be ""materiality"" as in the reference translation.
3. **""फरक ध्रुवका""**: The phrase ""फरक ध्रुवका"" means ""of different poles"" or ""opposite poles"" in the source. The machine translation translates it as ""different polarities,"" which is a reasonable approximation but not an exact match.
4. **""पदार्थ""**: The source uses ""पदार्थ"" (substance) which is not translated in the machine translation. It should be ""substance"" as in the reference translation.
5. **""प्रकृतिको गतिअनुरूप""**: The phrase ""प्रकृतिको गतिअनुरूप"" means ""according to the motion of nature"" in the source. The machine translation omits this phrase, which is crucial for understanding the context.

Reference translation: Pratihar hinted that they were the ones who would break down the main gate ..

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""प्रतिहार ले मुलद्वार भत्काउने"" (Pratihar hinted) which refers to a hint given by Pratihar about something.
- The machine translation translates this as ""that Issara was gone, saying"" which does not capture the hint aspect and instead suggests that Issara left while saying something.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly translates ""भत्काउने"" (to break down) and ""मुलद्वार"" (main gate) and conveys the idea that Pratihar was hinting at the action of breaking down the main gate.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in that it does not accurately convey the hint given by Pratihar and instead presents a more straightforward statement about Issara's departure.

Reference translation: Of these three children, Shatananda was highly enlightened and brilliant in cultural practices.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation refers to ""three generations of Satan"" while the source text mentions ""तीन सन्तान"" (three children), which is a different interpretation.
- The machine translation describes the individuals as ""mighty men and workmen"" but the source text does not provide a direct translation for ""कर्मकाण्डका प्रकाण्ड विद्वान"" (highly enlightened and brilliant in cultural practices). Instead, it implies a cultural context.

|Reference translation: Levesque is a great fan of the Motorhead musical group, which has given him three different entry music in WWE.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject identification**: The source mentions ""लेवेस्क"" (Levesque), but the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""Lewesk"" as a musical group, while the reference translation correctly identifies it as a person's name.
2. **Musical group**: The source states that Levesque is a ""अनुयायी"" (follower) of the ""मोटरहेड"" (Motorhead) group, but the machine translation incorrectly translates this to ""the three difficulties"" (which is a misinterpretation of the group's name).
3. **Context**: The machine translation incorrectly adds the context of ""WWII"" (World War II), which is not present in the source or reference translation.
4. **Action and music**: The source mentions that Motorhead has given ""तीन वटा फरकफरक प्रवेश सङ्गीत"" (three different entry music), while the machine translation incorrectly translates this to ""entitled music"" without specifying the context of WWE.

|Source: टेस्ला र उनको टिमले उक्त प्रोजेक्टलाई सदाका निम्ति परित्याग गरे ।|
|Machine translation: Tesla and his team abandoned that project forever.|
|Reference translation: Tesla and his team abandoned the project forever.|
|Analysis:|
1. **Subject and Object**: Both the source and reference translations correctly identify Tesla and his team as the subject and ""the project"" as the object. The machine translation uses ""that project"" instead of ""the project,"" which is a minor difference but still conveys the same meaning.
2. **Verb and Tense**: The verb ""निम्ति परित्याग गरे"" (abandoned) is correctly translated to ""abandoned"" in both. The tense is preserved in both machine and reference translations, indicating past action.
3. **Adverbial phrase**: The source text includes ""उक्त"" (spoken about or mentioned), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. However, the context suggests that it refers to a project that was discussed or known, which is implied in ""that project"" in English. The reference translation omits this detail but still conveys the same idea.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in the specificity of the project reference. The meaning is preserved, and the core message is the same. The main difference lies in the choice of ""that"" versus ""the"" to refer to the project, which is a stylistic choice rather than a significant error.|

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: विशुद्ध नेपाली रक संगीत, तथा पाश्चात्य संगीतमा नेपाली काव्य पनि धेरै नै प्रचलित छ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The Nepali catalogue is also very common in religious Nepali Rock Music, and patriotic music.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Nepali poetry is popular in both Nepali rock music , and Western music .

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation mentions ""Nepali catalogue"" which is not present in the source text. It seems to be a misinterpretation or a mistranslation.
- The source text talks about ""विशुद्ध नेपाली रक संगीत"" (clean Nepali rock music) and ""पाश्चात्य संगीतमा"" (and in traditional music), while the machine translation combines these into ""religious Nepali Rock Music"" and omits the mention of traditional music.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""नेपाली काव्य"" (Nepali poetry) and ""पाश्चात्य संगीत"" (traditional music) as ""Nepali poetry"" and ""Western music"", respectively.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation inaccurately translates ""रक संगीत"" (rock music) and omits the context of ""पाश्चात्य संगीतमा"" (traditional music).
- It introduces the concept of a ""Nepali catalogue"" which is not present in the source.

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the handling of rock music, traditional music, and the inclusion of a Nepali catalogue. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text.

|Reference translation: Michaels and H were reunited in 2010 's Tribute to the Troops event but they had stopped wrestling as a couple.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""माइकल्स"" (Michaels) and ""एचको"" (H), which are names, but the machine translation incorrectly translates them as ""Microcus"" and ""h's"" respectively. The reference translation correctly uses ""Michaels"" and ""H"".
2. The machine translation incorrectly refers to ""ट्रिब्युट टु द ट्रुप्स कार्यक्रम"" (Tribute to the Troops program) as ""the 2010 Tribune The Troops program,"" which is a mix of event and publication name. The reference translation separates it correctly as ""2010 's Tribute to the Troops event.""
3. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""जोडिको रुपमा"" (as a couple) as ""to play coruscus as a join,"" which is unrelated to the context. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""as a couple.""
4. The machine translation omits the word ""कुस्ती"" (wrestling) entirely, while the reference translation includes it.

In summary, the machine translation has significant differences in name handling, event description, and context, leading to a less accurate translation compared to the reference translation.

|Reference translation: Ram temple and Shiva temple were south of the first junction from the end, while north and east of them were three-storey hostel buildings covered with Jhingati.|

|Analysis|
1. **Source**: The source text mentions the location of Ram temple and Shiva temple relative to the first junction and the direction ""पछाडि"" (behind) and ""उत्तरतिरको"" (north of the first).
2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""पछाडि"" as ""behind"" and ""उत्तरतिरको"" as ""north court"", which suggests a confusion about the direction. It also incorrectly states that the north and east courts were ""shadow buildings"" instead of specifying the hostel building.
3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation correctly translates the direction as ""south of the first junction from the end"" and specifies that the hostel buildings are ""three-storey"" and ""covered with Jhingati.""

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following aspects:
- Incorrect interpretation of the source's direction: ""पछाडि"" as ""behind"" and ""उत्तरतिरको"" as ""north court"".
- Incorrect identification of the north and east courts as ""shadow buildings"" instead of specifying the hostel building.
- Lack of information about the hostel being three-storey and covered with Jhingati in the machine translation.

|Machine translation: Tourism is also venue, including the relics of the former bar of the police cell tappu wildlife sanctuary.|
|Reference translation: Because it is the entrance to the eastern part of Dharan Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, the tourist traffic is also increasing.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to the ""पूर्व पट्टीको द्धार"" (eastern boundary) of Dharan Koshi Tappu Wildlife Sanctuary, which is a geographical location.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the relics of the former bar of the police cell tappu,"" which is a misinterpretation of the context and does not convey the intended meaning of the location.
3. The reference translation correctly identifies the sanctuary as the entrance to the eastern part, which is relevant to the tourist traffic.
4. The machine translation omits the connection between the location and the increasing tourist traffic, while the reference translation includes this information.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in its interpretation of the location and its relevance to the tourist traffic. The reference translation is more accurate and contextually relevant.

|Machine translation: When the floor is stopped, new risks are generated from the damage reached by it.|
|Reference translation: When the earthquake is stopped, new risks are generated from the damage reached by it.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""भुईंचालो"" which is the Nepali word for ""earthquake"" and not ""floor"" as the machine translation suggests. This is a significant difference.
2. The phrase ""त्यसबाट पुगेको"" in the source text means ""from it"" or ""caused by it"" and is not directly translated to ""from the damage reached by it"" in the machine translation. The reference translation captures the intended meaning more accurately.
3. The machine translation omits the word ""रोकिन्छ"" (is stopped) which is crucial for the context, making the sentence less clear.

In conclusion, the machine translation is not accurate due to the incorrect interpretation of ""भुईंचालो"" as ""floor"" and the loss of the verb ""रोकिन्छ"" that indicates the earthquake stopping. The reference translation better captures the meaning and context of the source text.

|Reference translation: But Mandela himself said that relating his name with educational institutions except some is not correct.|

Analysis:
1. The source text is about Mandela's statement regarding the appropriateness of adding his name to educational institutions.
2. In the machine translation, it incorrectly attributes the statement to ""her name"" instead of Mandela's name, which is a misinterpretation of the context.
3. The machine translation also uses ""true"" to describe the situation, which is not present in the source text. The reference translation uses ""correct"" to convey the same meaning.

|Machine translation: It is also described in olds that the goddess mada male ram and mercury came here.|
|Reference translation: It is also described in olds that the god Ram and Krishna came here.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Translation of ""भगवान"" (god):** The machine translation incorrectly translates ""भगवान"" as ""goddess,"" which is a feminine noun. The reference translation correctly uses ""god.""
2. **Translation of ""मर्यादा"" (limit or restriction):** The machine translation omits this word, which is crucial for understanding the context. It should be included in the translation to convey the idea that Ram and Krishna are within a certain context or story.
3. **Translation of ""पुरुष"" (male):** The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""male"" (which is redundant with ""goddess"" in the previous part), while the reference translation omits it, as it is implied by the names Ram and Krishna being male deities.
4. **Translation of ""राम"" and ""कृष्ण"":** The names are correctly translated in both the machine and reference translations.
5. **Translation of ""यहाँ"" (here):** Both translations correctly convey the location.
6. **Translation of ""आएको"" (came):** Both translations correctly convey the action.
7. **Translation of ""कुरा पुराणहरुमा"" (in the ancient texts):** The machine translation omits this phrase, which is important for specifying the source of the description.

In summary, the machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the gender and context of the deities, as well as the inclusion of ""मर्यादा"" and ""कुरा पुराणहरुमा."" The correct translation should be: ""It is also described in the ancient texts that the god Ram and Krishna came here.""

Step 1: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- ""नेपाल प्रहरी"" (Nepali Police)
- ""अस्पताल"" (hospital)
- ""र"" (and)
- ""नेपाल प्रहरी विद्यालय"" (Nepal Police School)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""Nepal police volunteer"" and ""alternative to Nepal police school""
- Reference translation: ""Concept of Nepal Police Hospital"" and ""Nepal Police School""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation has ""Nepal police volunteer"" instead of ""Nepal Police Hospital"" which is a significant difference, as the source text refers to a hospital, not a volunteer program.
- The phrase ""र"" (and) is not translated in the machine translation, which affects the coherence of the sentence structure.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""नेपाल प्रहरी विद्यालयको परिकल्पना"" as ""Nepal Police School concept,"" while the machine translation uses ""alternative to"" which changes the meaning.

|Reference translation: The strong ones at the front hold the long wooden rows in place so that their beads are strong enough not to break, while the weak and old ones are placed back.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""लामो काठ लहरै"" (long wooden rods), not a single ""long wooden rod"" as in the machine translation. The machine translation incorrectly combines these into one object.
2. The source text uses ""ब्यूह"" (beads), which are not mentioned in the machine translation. The machine translation omits this detail, which is important for understanding the context.
3. The phrase ""समाएर आफ्नो ब्यूह नफुट्ने गरी"" (hold their beads in place so they don't break) is not accurately translated in the machine version. It is translated as ""holds a weak and elderly man,"" which is a misinterpretation.
4. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""पछाडि अलि कमजोर र बुढाहरुलाई राखिएको"" (while the weak and old ones are placed back) as ""and holds a strong man,"" which is the opposite of the intended meaning.

3. The reference translation correctly captures the idea of donating gold coins and the result being ""फल प्राप्त हुन्छ"" (getting the fruits, meaning the benefits or rewards).

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it incorrectly interprets the phrase ""एकएक प्रहरमा"" as acquiring a category, while the reference translation understands it as donating gold coins in each prawn.

|im_start|>|im_sep| Analyzing the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. **Source text**: The source text is in Nepali, which mentions a specific time frame (पूर्व र वि.स.२००७ सालसम्म पनि पूर्व २ नम्वर गोश्वाराको प्रशासनिक इकाईको रूपमा रहेको दोलखालाई) referring to Dolakha's administrative status before 2007 and until 2018 B.S.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation attempts to convey the same information but with a slightly different structure and terminology. It says ""2007 East and w. 2018 Summit, also referred to as the east 2 Number Goshawks administrative unit."" Here, it combines the years 2007 and 2018 into ""East and w. 2018"" and uses ""Summit"" instead of specifying Dolakha. It also mentions ""Goshawks administrative unit"" which is not accurate, as Goshwara is a place, not an administrative unit.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text, translating it as ""Dolakha , formerly the administrative unit of Goshwara No. 2 before 2007 and until 2018 B.S.""

The main differences are:
- The machine translation incorrectly combines the years and uses ""Summit"" instead of specifying Dolakha.
- It refers to ""Goshawks administrative unit"" which is not correct, as it should be ""Goshwara No. 2 administrative unit.""
- The reference translation maintains the correct context and place name, which is crucial for understanding the meaning.

To improve the quality of the Nepali-English translation, the machine translation should be adjusted to reflect the specific place name (Dolakha) and the correct administrative unit (Goshwara No. 2) while preserving the time frame information.

|Source: रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चको दवावपूर्ण विरोध हुँदाहुँदै स्पेनले वैवाहिक समानतालाई मान्यता दिने गरी कानुन बनायो ।|
|Machine translation: During the suppression of the Roman Catholic Church, Spain made laws regarding religious equality.|
|Reference translation: Spain made a law to give equal recognition to marriage despite strong criticism of Roman Catholic churches.|

Analysis:
1. The source text talks about the ""दवावपूर्ण विरोध"" (strong opposition) against the Roman Catholic Church, which implies that the opposition was not just suppression but also against a specific issue, likely related to marriage or religious practices.
2. The machine translation omits this context, stating ""religious equality"" without specifying the context of marriage.
3. The reference translation correctly adds the detail that the law was made ""to give equal recognition to marriage"" and acknowledges the ""strong criticism of Roman Catholic churches.""
4. The machine translation does not convey the nuance of the opposition being specifically about marriage equality, which is present in the reference translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation because it does not clearly specify the context of marriage equality and the nature of the opposition as being against the Roman Catholic Church's stance on it. The reference translation provides a more accurate and complete representation of the source text.

|Source: अयोध्या, मथुरा, पंपापुरी, कौशांबी, सारनाथ आदि यसै कारण तीर्थ मानिएको छ र तिनको यात्रा पनि यसै भावनादेखि तीर्थ स्थान मानिएका छन्।|
|Machine translation: Ayodhya, mathura, punpuri, kaushanbi, sarnath etc. are considered for this reason, and her journeys have been considered for this reason.|
|Reference translation: Ayodhya , Mathura , Pampapuri , Kaushambi , Sarnath etc. are considered as pilgrimage places for this reason and his travels are also considered as pilgrimage places from this sentiment .|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference in translation of ""तीर्थ मानिएको छ"" (are considered as pilgrimage)**:
   - Machine translation: ""are considered for this reason""
   - Reference translation: ""are considered as pilgrimage places for this reason""
   The machine translation omits the word ""places"" and does not convey the full meaning of the reference translation, which specifically mentions ""pilgrimage places.""

2. **Difference in translation of ""तिनको यात्रा"" (her journeys)**:
   - Machine translation: ""her journeys have been considered for this reason""
   - Reference translation: ""his travels are also considered as pilgrimage places""
   The machine translation incorrectly translates ""तिनको"" (her) to ""her"" instead of ""his"" (his), which changes the subject and context, referring to a female subject instead of a male one, as typically associated with Ayodhya, Mathura, and Sarnath.

3. **Difference in translation of ""यसै भावनादेखि"" (from this sentiment)**
   - Machine translation: Not present in the machine translation
   - Reference translation: ""from this sentiment""
   The machine translation does not include this phrase, which is crucial to convey the emotional aspect of considering these places as pilgrimage sites.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of:
- Incorrectly translating ""तिनको"" to ""her"" instead of ""his""
- Not including the phrase ""यसै भावनादेखि"" to convey the emotional context
- Not specifying that these places are considered as pilgrimage places.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: जय कृष्ण तिवारीलाई कास्कीका राजा कुलमण्डलन शाहले वि.सं.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Jaya Percy Tiwari, the king of Cascades, tribal chief of Cascades.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Jai Krishna Tiwari was succeeded by King Kulamandan Shah of Kaski.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""जय कृष्ण तिवारीलाई"" (Jai Krishna Tiwari), which is a name, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""Jaya Percy Tiwari"" (apparently assuming a different name).
- The source text refers to ""कास्कीका राजा कुलमण्डलन शाह"" (King Kulamandan Shah of Kaski), indicating a succession, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""the king of Cascades"" and omits the connection to Kaski.
- The machine translation also adds ""tribal chief of Cascades"" which is not present in the source text.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation accurately captures the relationship between Jai Krishna Tiwari and King Kulamandan Shah, indicating a succession.
- It also specifies the connection to Kaski, which is crucial for understanding the context.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the name and the context, which is about a succession and the geographical connection. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

|Machine translation: And it came to pass, when he took over the shadow, that he stayed as his manager.|
|Reference translation: He took charge of the printing press and he stayed as its manager.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""छापाखानालाई"" (printing press), which is not translated accurately as ""shadow"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly uses ""printing press.""
2. The phrase ""जिम्मा लिई"" (for the responsibility) is missing in the machine translation, which affects the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation includes this part, making it clear that the action was taken for a specific purpose.
3. The machine translation uses ""his manager"" without specifying whose manager, which is implied in the source text as ""त्यसको प्रबन्धकका रूपमा"" (in the role of its manager). The reference translation clarifies this by saying ""its manager.""

Overall, the machine translation is significantly different from the reference translation in terms of accuracy and clarity, particularly in the context of the printing press and the relationship to responsibility.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation has a few errors:
   - ""Bostan Caesar"" is likely a typo, as it should be ""बोस्टान सिजर"" (Boston Cesar) as per the source.
   - ""Andrèj Kim"" is misspelled as ""Andrèj Kim"" in the machine translation, while the correct spelling is ""आन्द्रेज किमले"" (Andrej Kim) in the source.

|Machine translation: At that time there was a questionable role of motiram in the reformist view of the cedar.|
|Reference translation: At that time, Motiram had tremendous role in the reformist perspective of Dev Shumsher.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""देवशमशेरको"" (Dev Shumsher's), which is a proper noun, but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""the cedar,"" which is a different subject.
2. The machine translation uses ""questionable role"" instead of ""tremendous role"" from the reference translation, which changes the meaning and conveys a negative impression rather than the significant role Motiram had.
3. The reference translation specifies ""Motiram"" as the subject, while the machine translation omits this, making it unclear who the role belongs to.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the proper noun ""Dev Shumsher"" being replaced with ""cedar,"" the description of Motiram's role as ""questionable"" instead of ""tremendous,"" and the lack of clarity about the subject in the machine translation.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly interprets the ""वैवाहिक प्रसंग"" (marital context) as ""alien context,"" which is a misinterpretation and does not convey the intended meaning.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation correctly captures the meaning by translating ""वैवाहिक प्रसंग"" as ""reference to marriage"" and emphasizes the exciting and listenable aspects of Gautam Rishi's life.

4. **Relevance to life aspects**: The machine translation mentions ""other beats"" and ""living of minor debts,"" which are not present in the source text. The reference translation, on the other hand, focuses on ""other aspects of life.""

5. **Sentence structure**: The machine translation has a different sentence structure, making it less coherent and accurate compared to the reference translation.

|Machine translation: The Provincial Janapad Province of military police and khaibar province nominated that territories from that region to escape.|
|Reference translation: Military police and the provincial district police of Khyber province blocked the area to prevent the terrorists from escaping.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject and action**: In the source, the subject is ""सैनिक प्रहरी तथा खैबर प्रान्तको प्रान्तीय जनपद प्रहरी"" (Military police and provincial district police of Khyber province), and the action is ""नाकाबन्दी गरे"" (blocked). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""nominated that territories to escape,"" which is not the correct verb to describe the action taken by the police.

2. **Purpose of the action**: The source states that the action was taken to prevent terrorists from escaping, which is not explicitly mentioned in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly conveys this purpose.

3. **Location**: The source specifies ""उक्त क्षेत्र"" (the mentioned area), while the machine translation omits this detail.

4. **Verb tense**: The source uses the past tense, which is not clearly indicated in the machine translation. The reference translation uses the past tense as well.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the subject's action (incorrectly translating ""blocked"" as ""nominated""), the purpose of the action (not mentioning the prevention of escape), and the specificity of the location.

Step 1: Identify the main components of the source text
- Subject: राजाको नेतृत्वमा (under the leadership of the king)
- Object: परामर्शदात्री र नेपाल प्रजा पार्टीको सरकार (consultant and Nepal Praja Party government)
- Action: गठन (formation)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""Government of Nepal Praja Party, a parliamentary constituency under the leadership of the king\ttwo.""
- Reference translation: ""Constitution of consultant and government of Nepal Praja Party in leadership of the King.""

Differences:
1. The machine translation omits the word ""सं."" (Constitution) which is present in the source text.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""परामर्शदात्री"" (consultant) as ""parliamentary constituency,"" which is not accurate. It should be translated as ""consultant"" or ""advisory role.""
3. The reference translation correctly mentions ""in leadership of the King"" while the machine translation uses ""under the leadership of the king"" which is structurally similar but might imply a different level of authority.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation has several discrepancies with the reference translation, including the missing word ""सं."" (Constitution), incorrect interpretation of ""परामर्शदात्री"" (consultant), and a potentially different nuance in the description of the leadership. The quality of the translation could be improved by addressing these issues.

|Machine translation: Part of this fundamental reaction is developed by bestial mediators such as chemotectic factors.|
|Reference translation: This cell 's diffusion reaction is developed thorough reactionary neutralizer like chemoetectic element.|

**Analysis:**

1. **""यस कोषको""** (This cell) - Machine translation: ""Part of this fundamental reaction"" - The machine translation omits the possessive ""कोषको"" (cell's) which is important to indicate that the reaction belongs to the cell.
2. **""भाग प्रतिक्रियालाई""** (to the reaction) - Machine translation: ""is developed by"" - The source text specifies that the mediators are responsible for the development of the reaction, while the machine translation implies a more general process of development.
3. **""उत्तेजक मध्यस्थकर्ताहरू""** (bestial mediators) - Machine translation: ""bestial mediators"" - The source uses ""उत्तेजक"" (reactive or stimulatory), which is a more specific term than ""bestial"" in the reference translation. The reference translation uses ""reactive neutralizer"" which is a more accurate term for the context.
4. **""जस्तै""** (like) - Machine translation: ""such as"" - The machine translation correctly uses ""such as"" to introduce examples, but the source text uses ""जस्तै"" (like) which is more colloquial and less formal than ""such as.""
5. **""केमोटेक्टिक तत्व""** (chemotectic factors) - Machine translation: ""chemotectic factors"" - The machine translation accurately captures the term.

In summary, the machine translation loses some context and specificity, particularly in the possessive and the choice of terms. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the original Nepali sentence.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: A detailed explanation related to employment is given in paragraph 17 of this guide.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""bankruptcy"" which is a mistranslation, as the source text talks about ""विस्तृत ब्याख्या"" (detailed explanation), not financial bankruptcy.
- The machine translation refers to ""directive"" while the reference translation uses ""guide,"" which might be a difference in terminology, but both can be acceptable in the context of providing instructions or information.
- The source text specifically mentions ""रोजगारी सम्बन्धी"" (related to employment), which is not directly translated in the machine translation, but the meaning is implied in ""unemployment relations.""

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the use of ""bankruptcy"" instead of ""detailed explanation,"" and the term ""directive"" instead of ""guide.""

Source: यही बैठकले गाउँलाई अनुशासित बनाउन नयाँ नियम कानुन पनि बनाउँछ ।
Machine translation: The same meeting also makes new rules legislation to administer the town.

Step 2: Identify differences in word order and structure.
- In the source text, ""नयाँ नियम कानुन"" (new rules legislation) is a compound noun, while in the machine translation, it is separated into two separate phrases ""new rules"" and ""legislation.""
- The source text uses ""बनाउन"" (to make) as the verb for the action, while the machine translation uses ""also makes.""

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences on meaning.
- The difference in word order slightly affects the flow of the sentence, but the overall meaning is preserved: both convey that the meeting creates new rules or laws for managing the town.
- The verb difference is minor and does not change the core meaning.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with only minor differences in word order and structure. The meaning is preserved, and the core message is clear. However, the compound noun in the source text is split, which could be slightly less natural in English.

1. **Subject and verb**: The source text refers to ""this dance"" (यो नाचले नाच्ने) as the subject, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""dancing"" (dancing, singing, and playing). The reference translation correctly identifies the dance as the subject that affects the dancers, singers, and musicians.
2. **Object and emotion**: The source text uses ""निकै मख्ख बनाउँछ"" to express that the dance brings happiness (निकै मख्ख) to the dancers, singers, and musicians. The machine translation translates this as ""too much"" (too much), which is not an accurate reflection of the positive emotion. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""very happy"" (very happy).
3. **Structure**: The source sentence structure is simple, with the dance as the main focus and the effect on the performers. The machine translation, however, combines the actions (dancing, singing, and playing) into a single phrase, losing the original meaning.

2. **Action**: The source states ""ट्रिपल एचले आक्रमण गरेको"" (Triple H had attacked), while the machine translation reverses the subject and verb, saying ""Triple H was turned on that she had attacked."" This is a misinterpretation of the action.

3. **Object**: Both translations correctly identify the object as ""बिन रोलिन्सलाई"" (Bin Rollins). However, the machine translation uses ""he"" instead of ""she"" (as in ""Bin Rollins""), which is a gender inconsistency.

4. **Verb tense**: The source uses the past tense ""गरेको"" (had attacked), while the machine translation uses the present tense ""was turned on"" and ""had attacked."" The reference translation is more accurate in using the past tense.

5. **Revelation**: The source implies that the revelation of the attack was part of a story or event, whereas the machine translation suggests a more direct and immediate action of ""turning on."" The reference translation captures this aspect better by saying ""revealed.""

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: उता रानीले राजाको सवारी हुन लागेको थाहा पाएर दासीलाई स्वागत सत्कार गर्न द्वारमा उभ्याई।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The Utah Queen sets up a gate to welcome Daisy, knowing that the king's transport is to be.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Meanwhile, the queen upon hearing about the king's arrival stood her maids to welcome at the door.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""उता रानी"" (the Utah Queen), but the machine translation refers to ""The Utah Queen,"" which is a direct translation error, as ""उता"" is a proper noun referring to a specific person or place, not a geographical location like Utah.
- The source text talks about the queen's action upon hearing about the king's arrival, while the machine translation suggests that the queen knows the king's transport is coming, which is not the same as knowing about the arrival.
- The source text uses ""थाहा पाएर"" (at the door), which is a location, whereas the machine translation omits this detail.
- The source text describes the queen standing her maids to welcome, while the machine translation uses ""sets up a gate"" which is a different action.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text, mentioning the queen's action upon hearing about the king's arrival and having her maids stand at the door to welcome.
- It correctly translates ""दासीलाई स्वागत सत्कार गर्न"" (to welcome her maids) and ""पाएर"" (at the door).

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of proper noun interpretation, the context of the queen's knowledge, and the specific action of welcoming. The reference translation is a more accurate and faithful representation of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: कृष्णले सबै ब्रजवासीहरूलाई गोबर्धन गिरीको फेदीमा लिएर गए।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: And he brought all the brazen men into the benefit of the girl.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Krishna took all the people of Braj to the foot of Gobardhan Giri.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""कृष्णले"" (Krishna), which is not translated accurately as ""And he"" in the machine translation.
- ""सबै ब्रजवासीहरूलाई"" (all the people of Braj) is translated as ""all the brazen men,"" which is a misinterpretation. The term ""ब्रजवासी"" (Brajwasi) refers to people from the Braj region, not ""brazen men.""
- ""गोबर्धन गिरीको फेदीमा"" (to the foot of Gobardhan Giri) is translated as ""into the benefit of the girl,"" which is not a correct translation of the location.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text, mentioning Krishna, the people of Braj, and the destination, Gobardhan Giri.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the subject (Krishna), the people being referred to (Brajwasi vs. brazen men), and the intended destination (foot of Gobardhan Giri vs. benefit of a girl). The reference translation is a more accurate and faithful representation of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: हा हा साठी बरिष पुगीमा सक्यो, छैन हामुलाई पुत्र फल

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Sixty-buried hamu, no hamu, Son of fruits

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: I 've reached sixty , never blessed with a child .

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text talks about ""बरिष पुगीमा"" (reaching sixty) and ""छैन हामुलाई पुत्र फल"" (never having a child).
- The machine translation seems to interpret ""बरिष पुगीमा"" as ""Sixty-buried hamu"" and ""छैन हामुलाई पुत्र फल"" as ""no hamu, Son of fruits.""

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation is not accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. It incorrectly translates ""बरिष पुगीमा"" as a numerical phrase and misses the context of reaching sixty, while it combines ""छैन हामुलाई पुत्र फल"" into two separate phrases that do not make sense in English.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is of poor quality because it fails to capture the intended meaning of the source text, specifically the context of reaching sixty and the lack of children. A more accurate translation would be: ""I have reached sixty, and I have no children.""

|Source: यदि तिमी आश्वीन कृष्णपक्षको इंदिरा एकादशीको व्रत मेरा निम्ति गर्नसक्छौ भने मलाई स्वर्गप्राप्ति हुनेछ।|
|Machine translation: If you can do to me the Indira Academy of mercy, I will be heavily involved.|
|Reference translation: If you can make Ashwin Krishnapaksha 's Indira Ekadashi fast for me, I will go to heaven.|
|Analysis:|
1. **""तिमी आश्वीन कृष्णपक्षको""** (you Ashwin Krishnapaksha's) - The machine translation omits the possessive ""कृष्णपक्षको"" and replaces it with ""Academy of mercy"", which is incorrect. The reference translation correctly includes the name and possessive.
2. **""इंदिरा एकादशीको व्रत""** (Indira Ekadashi fast) - The machine translation incorrectly translates this phrase as ""Indira Academy of mercy"", which is a misinterpretation. The reference translation accurately translates it as a fast associated with Indira Ekadashi, a Hindu festival.
3. **""मेरा निम्ति""** (my salvation) - The machine translation does not convey the meaning of ""nimi"" (my) and instead uses ""heavily involved"", which is unrelated. The reference translation correctly uses ""my salvation.""
4. **""हुनेछ""** (will happen) - The machine translation does not include this future tense marker, making the sentence structure incomplete. The reference translation includes it, making the sentence clear.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of proper name handling, festival context, and the meaning of certain phrases. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

|Source: द शिल्डको बीच स्थिति तनाब ग्रस्त भएता पनि शिल्डको दुश्मन केनसँग भयो र रेसलमेनिया ३० मा द शिल्डले केन र द न्यु ऐज आउटललाई हराएका थिए ।|
|Machine translation: Although the position between the shield was tanab grabbed, the shield's enemy was with Ken and racelmenia 30. The Shield had lost to ken and racelmenia 30, and racelmenia 30 had lost to racelmenia 30 and racelmenia 30.|
|Reference translation: Despite the tense situation between The Shield, Shield's foe was with Kane, and at WrestleMania 30, The Shield defeated Kane and The New Age Out.|

Analysis:

1. **Source**: The source text is in Nepali, discussing a situation in which The Shield (a wrestling stable) is in a tense position with their enemy, Kane, at WrestleMania 30, and they defeated The New Age Out.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation attempts to convey the same information but makes several errors:
   - ""tanab grabbed"" is likely a mistranslation or a misunderstanding of the tense situation, as it doesn't make sense in the context.
   - ""the shield's enemy was with Ken and racelmenia 30"" is confusing, as it suggests that both Ken and racelmenia 30 are the enemy, which is not clear from the source.
   - The second part of the sentence is repetitive and unclear, stating that racelmenia 30 lost to itself, which is illogical.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation accurately captures the meaning, maintaining the tense situation, the involvement of Kane, and the outcome of The Shield defeating The New Age Out.

In conclusion, the machine translation has several issues, including incorrect interpretation of the tense situation, confusion about the enemy, and a repetitive and illogical structure. The reference translation is a more accurate and coherent representation of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Identify the main components of the source text.
- Subject: बझाङ्गको राज्य (Kingdom of bazhang)
- Time reference: वि.स.१७९४ (1794)
- Context: राजा कल्याणसिहका पालादेखि (According to the records of the palace of kalantseh)
- Independence: स्वतन्त्र राजाको हैसियतमा (independence of the king)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: The Kingdom of bazhang appears in the hunting of the independent king from the palace of kalantseh according to the records of 1794.
- Reference translation: The Kingdom of bazhang appears to be independent from the time of king kalyansingh according to the records of 1794.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""राजा कल्याणसिहका पालादेखि"" as ""the hunting of the independent king,"" which is a misinterpretation of the context. The reference translation correctly understands it as ""from the time of king kalyansingh.""
- The machine translation omits the direct reference to the king's name, ""कल्याणसिहका,"" which is important for clarity.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the context (misunderstanding ""राजा कल्याणसिहका पालादेखि"" as ""hunting"") and the lack of the specific king's name, ""कल्याणसिहका."" The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

|Source: आरोहणका रङ्गकर्मी सुनिल पोखरेल नेपाली रङ्गमञ्चका प्रतिबद्ध सिर्जनशील नाट्यकर्मी मानिन्छन्।|
|Machine translation: Sunil Pokharel, the colorist of the climb, is considered a committed creative naturalist.|
|Reference translation: Aarohan 's playwright Sunil Pokharel is considered to be a committed creative playwright of Nepali theater.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""रङ्गकर्मी"" (colorist) in the context of ""आरोहण"" (climb), which is not accurately translated as ""the colorist of the climb"" in the machine translation. The correct interpretation is that Sunil Pokharel is a colorist for a Nepali theater production, not specifically related to the climb as a physical activity.
2. The machine translation incorrectly identifies Sunil Pokharel as a ""naturalist,"" which is not mentioned in the source or reference translations. The context suggests that he is a ""नाट्यकर्मी"" (playwright) for Nepali theater.
3. The reference translation correctly identifies Sunil Pokharel as a ""playwright"" and specifies that he is ""of Nepali theater,"" which is missing in the machine translation.

Machine translation: Patriarch Yudhishthir asked the goddess Mr. Percy!

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Dharmaraj Yudhisthira inquired from Lord Krishna and asked, O Lord !

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the source text, ""धर्मराज"" (Dharmaraj) is a proper noun referring to a character, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""Patriarch Yudhishthir"" (which is a mix of the name and a title).
- The source text uses ""भगवान्"" (Bhagwan) to address Lord Krishna, a deity, while the machine translation omits this honorific and translates it as ""goddess Mr. Percy"" which is a completely different context.
- The phrase ""जिज्ञासा गर्दै सोधे"" (inquiring) is missing in the machine translation, which is crucial for understanding the action.
- The reference translation includes the respectful address ""O Lord!"" at the end, which is not present in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of proper nouns, the deity addressed, the action being performed, and the respectful tone. The quality of the translation is poor.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: पवित्र हृदयवालाले मात्र आत्मतत्व चिन्न वा जान्न सक्छन् ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Holy heart may only recognize or know spirituality.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Only a person with a pure heart can know or understand the self.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""पवित्र हृदयवालाले"" (Holy heart), which refers to a heart that is pure or holy.
- ""मात्र"" (only) indicates that the following action is exclusive to this condition.
- ""आत्मतत्व"" (self-consciousness or self) is the main subject.
- ""चिन्न"" (recognize) or ""जान्न"" (know) are verbs that describe the action.
- ""सक्छन्"" (can) is the ability to perform the action.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation captures the idea of a holy heart but uses ""recognize or know spirituality"" instead of ""know or understand the self.""
- The reference translation emphasizes the understanding of the self, which is a more specific and personal concept than spirituality in this context.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in that it translates ""आत्मतत्व"" (self) as ""spirituality,"" which is a broader term than the specific understanding of the self in the Nepali text. The reference translation captures the nuance of a pure heart's ability to know the self, while the machine translation loses this nuance.

|Machine translation: And it came to pass on a day, that the king was so loaned, that the loan came to the king's house.|
|Reference translation: One day the king was so anxious, and the sage Gautam came to the king wandering around.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text starts with ""एक दिन"" (One day), which is translated to ""And it came to pass on a day"" in the machine translation. While the meaning is similar, the phrasing is different and less idiomatic in English.
2. ""राजा यस्तै चिंतामा मग्न थिए"" (the king was so anxious) is translated to ""the king was so loaned"" in the machine translation. Here, the machine has misunderstood the context, as ""चिंतामा मग्न"" means ""very anxious"" or ""extremely worried,"" not ""loaned.""
3. ""गौतम ऋषि"" (the sage Gautam) is correctly translated, but the phrase ""घुम्दाघुम्दै"" (wandering around) is missing in the machine translation. It is an important detail to convey the sage's movement.
4. ""राजाका सामु"" (the king's house) is translated to ""that the loan came to the king's house"" in the machine translation, which is a literal but incorrect interpretation of the original phrase. The correct translation should be ""the sage came to the king's presence.""

In summary, the machine translation has differences in the interpretation of the king's anxiety, the action of the sage wandering around, and the context of the sage's arrival at the king's house. The reference translation provides a more natural and accurate translation that captures the essence of the source text.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""अधिकांस मगर समुदायको वाहुल्यता"" which means ""predominantly Magar community"" in Nepali. The machine translation omits this context, stating ""which is part of the overseas magistrate community"" which is not accurate.
2. The source refers to ""गाविसमा"" (village context) while the machine translation does not specify this, making it sound like a broader term or a different context.
3. The reference translation correctly identifies ""भुवनपोखरी गाविसमा"" as VDC (Village Development Committee) and adds the detail that it is predominantly Magar.
4. The machine translation lists ""brahmin, regional, kumalgarh community"" without specifying that these are different categories of people living in the village, while the reference translation separates them as Brahmins, Chhetris, and Kumals.
5. The machine translation mentions ""damai, kami, sarci, and chalukyas"" as a single group, whereas the reference translation clarifies that these are additional minorities living there.

Machine translation: I will also receive the rest of the season.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of gaining time to rest in the context of the source text.

Step 6: Identify the difference
The main difference is that the machine translation is focusing on receiving the season as a whole, while the reference translation emphasizes the personal time to rest that comes with it.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation, as it does not convey the same meaning of taking a break or resting, but instead suggests receiving the entire season.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Reacting to this, Britney responded, ""What's the big deal?""

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation has a repetition of ""a big thing"" which is not present in the source text or the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""did not respond"" while the source text implies a response (by asking a question) and the reference translation captures this by saying ""Reacting to this.""
- The machine translation has a slightly different phrasing of the question, ""कुन ठूलो कुरा हो र?"" which translates to ""What's the big deal?"" in the reference translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of repetition and phrasing.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: लिक्विडेटर नियुक्तिका निमित्त निवेदन दर्ता भएको सात दिन भित्र विभागका रजिष्ट्रार

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Registrar of the department within seven days of registration of liquidator appointments

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Registrar of the Department within seven days of registration of application for appointment of Liquidator

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the source text, ""नियुक्तिका निमित्त"" refers to the ""appointment document"" or ""application for appointment"" of a liquidator.
- The machine translation omits this part, translating it as ""registration of liquidator appointments"" which is not as clear as the reference translation, which specifies ""application for appointment.""

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it does not explicitly mention ""application"" for the appointment of a liquidator, which is crucial for understanding the context. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate translation by including this detail.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: जस सदनलाई कुनै सन्देश यस प्रकार पठाईिएको हो उ सदन त्यस सन्देशमा लिखे विषयमा सुविधानुसार शीघ्रताबाट विचार गर्दछ।
Machine translation: Whoever is sent to the Senate, considers the Senate from the quick as concerning the word.

Step 2: Identify differences in meaning and structure.
- The source text talks about a message being sent to the Senate and the Senate's response in considering the matter quickly according to convenience.
- The machine translation seems to have a misunderstanding, stating that someone is sent to the Senate and considers the Senate itself quickly, which is not the same as considering the message's content.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: The House to which a message is sent in this manner considers the matter contained in that message expeditiously as per convenience.

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The reference translation correctly captures the idea that the House (or Senate, as per context) considers the content of the message, not the Senate itself.
- The reference uses ""expeditiously"" to convey the speed at which the matter is considered, which is a more accurate translation of ""शीघ्रताबाट"" (with speed).

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it incorrectly focuses on the sender's perspective (considering the Senate itself) instead of the Senate's consideration of the message's content. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

|Source: वातावरणीय प्रदुषकहरूमा घरभित्र र बाहिर दुवै स्थानको  खराब वायु गुणस्तर पर्दछ।|
|Machine translation: In Environmental Polluters, there is a bad air quality of both locations inside and outside of the house.|
|Reference translation: Environmental pollutants include poor air quality , both indoors and outdoors.|

Analysis:
1. The source text is about the connection between environmental pollutants and the poor air quality in both indoor and outdoor settings.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""घरभित्र र बाहिर"" (indoors and outside) as ""both locations inside and outside of the house,"" which implies a focus on the house as a whole, rather than the two separate locations.
3. The reference translation correctly conveys the idea that environmental pollutants encompass poor air quality in both indoor and outdoor spaces without specifying a house.

To improve the machine translation, it should be revised to: ""Environmental pollutants encompass poor air quality, both inside and outside the house."" This better aligns with the reference translation and maintains the original meaning of the source text.

|Machine translation: There are 60 engineering and 416 associate campuses of this university.|
|Reference translation: This university has 60 associated and 416 affiliated campuses.|

Analysis:
1. The source text uses ""आंगिक"" which refers to ""engineering"" in Nepali, while the machine translation uses ""engineering"" directly, which is accurate.
2. The source text uses ""सम्वन्धन"" which means ""affiliated"" in Nepali, but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""associate"" which is not the correct term for the Nepali context. The reference translation correctly uses ""affiliated.""
3. The structure of the sentence is slightly different in the source and reference translations. The source places ""60  आंगिक"" before ""तथा"" (and), while the reference places ""60 associated"" after ""This university has."" The machine translation follows the structure of the source, but the reference is more natural in English.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in the incorrect use of ""associate"" instead of ""affiliated"" and the placement of the numbers and descriptions. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the original Nepali sentence.

|Thought: The source text is discussing the creation of new essay types in Nepali society, specifically mentioning sectoral specialization, assimilation, and cross-sector interface as factors. The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the context, translating ""विधाञ्जन, विधामिश्रण, विधान्तरण"" (genres, genre blending, genre transformations) as ""banquets created for genres"" which is not an accurate representation of the original meaning. The reference translation, on the other hand, captures the essence of the source by translating it as ""new types of essays from sectoral specialization, sectoral assimilation, and cross-sector interface.""

|Analysis:|
1. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""विधाञ्जन"" (genres) as ""banquets,"" which is a literal and unrelated interpretation.
2. ""विधामिश्रण"" (genre blending) is not translated accurately, as it suggests a mixing of genres, not a creation of banquets.
3. ""विधान्तरण"" (genre transformations) is also translated inaccurately, implying a change in genre format rather than the process of transformation.

|Conclusion:|
The machine translation fails to convey the intended meaning of the source text, particularly in terms of the context of essay creation and the specific factors mentioned. The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation. The differences lie in the understanding and interpretation of genre-related terms and the overall meaning of the sentence.|

Step 1: Compare the structure and meaning of the source text with the machine translation.
Source: लक्ष्य निश्चित भएकालाई बाटो देखाउन जति सजिलो हुन्छ, समस्यामा रनभुल्ल परेकालाई त्यति नै कठिन हुन्छ ।
Machine translation: As it is easy to show the way the goal is fixed, it is difficult to get rid of the problem.

Step 2: Identify differences in sentence structure and word choice.
- The source text starts with ""लक्ष्य निश्चित भएकालाई"" (to those with a definite goal), while the machine translation omits this context.
- The source text uses ""जति सजिलो हुन्छ"" (it becomes difficult), which implies a shift in difficulty, whereas the machine translation uses ""it is difficult"" without the context of the goal being shown.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: The easier it is to show the way to those who have a definite goal, the harder it is to those who run into problems.

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The reference translation captures the intended contrast between showing the way to those with a goal and the difficulty faced by those with problems.
- The machine translation loses the nuance of the original sentence, which emphasizes the difficulty increasing based on the context of having a goal or encountering problems.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it omits the context of the goal and does not convey the contrast between the ease of showing the way and the difficulty faced by different groups. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|>

Step 1: Understand the source text
The source text in Nepali says, ""कोही कालोधन सोहोर्न पल्केको छ भने उसलाई भ्रष्टचारीको विल्ला भिराइदिन्थे।"" This sentence translates to ""If someone was found to be squandering black money, they would be considered corrupt.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation provided is, ""Whoever is black, let him be filled with corruption."" This sentence has a different meaning than the source text. It suggests that being black is the reason for corruption, which is not the case in the original Nepali sentence.

Step 3: Analyze the differences
The key differences are:
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""कालोधन"" (black money) as ""black,"" which is a literal translation and does not convey the financial context.
- The machine translation omits the conditional aspect of the original sentence, which is crucial for understanding the meaning. The source text implies a condition (if someone is found to be squandering black money) while the machine translation presents it as a general statement.
- The machine translation uses ""let him be filled with corruption"" which is not a direct translation of ""भ्रष्टचारीको विल्ला भिराइदिन्थे"" (they would be labelled as a corrupt), instead it implies a passive action of corruption, whereas the reference translation implies a direct association between squandering black money and being labeled corrupt.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of meaning and context. It misinterprets the financial context and the conditional aspect of the sentence, leading to a less accurate representation of the original Nepali text.

|Machine translation: With the win, the venues had full ownership in the WWF.|
|Reference translation: With the win, they got the full ownership of WWF.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""उनिहरूले"" (they), which is the plural form in Nepali, indicating a group or individuals. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""the venues,"" which is singular and does not convey the same meaning.
2. The source text uses ""पूर्ण स्वामित्व"" (full ownership), which is a compound term. The machine translation separates it into ""full ownership in the WWF,"" which is grammatically correct but loses the nuance of the original Nepali phrase.
3. The verb ""पाएका थिए"" (got) is the past tense passive form in Nepali, indicating that the ownership was received. The machine translation omits this aspect, making the sentence less clear about the action.

|Reference translation: prachand already expressed his view on behalf of the declaration for people 's republic of Nepal in 2000, in an interview with communist magazine the Revolutionary World.|

Analysis:
1. **Time reference**: The machine translation uses ""junagadh Nepal"" instead of ""janagadh Nepal"" (people's republic of Nepal) as in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as it changes the meaning to imply that Prachand's idea was related to a declaration for a different entity, not the People's Republic of Nepal.
2. **Political affiliation**: The machine translation refers to the magazine as ""wampanthi"" while the reference translation specifies it as ""communist."" This distinction is important because it affects the context of the interview and Prachand's affiliation.
3. **Action description**: The machine translation uses ""placed his idea"" while the reference translation uses ""expressed his view."" Although similar, ""expressed his view"" is more accurate in this context, as it implies sharing an opinion rather than just placing it.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific political entity, the magazine's affiliation, and the action description. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

2. **Source to Machine Translation**: The source uses ""निरंकुश"" (autocratic) to describe the monarchy, while the machine translation uses ""neglected"" which does not convey the same level of powerlessness or lack of legitimacy.
3. **Source to Machine Translation**: The verb ""प्रहार गरे"" (attacked) is translated to ""prevailed over"" in the machine translation, which is not an accurate representation of the original meaning. The attack on the monarchy is a more active and assertive action in the source text.

|Reference translation: And then, the only girl child was born to Basudev at the house of Nandgop in Gokul.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""त्यसपछी"" (since then), which is not accurately translated as ""Since then"" in the machine translation. It should be ""त्यसपछि"" or ""त्यसको बाद"" (after that) in English.
2. ""वसुदेवलाई"" (to Wusudeva) is not present in the machine translation, which makes it unclear who the subject is. In the reference translation, it is translated as ""to Basudev,"" which is more appropriate.
3. ""मात्र एक कन्याको जन्म भएको छ"" (only one girl child was born) is translated as ""has been born only one virgin"" in the machine translation, which is a misinterpretation. The correct translation should be ""the only girl child was born.""

1. **""घटोत्कछ वा घटाल""** (Ghatotkach or Ghatal) - Machine translation: ""who was born or descended from"" is not accurate. It should be translated as ""who was Ghatotkach or Ghatal"" to maintain the reference's meaning.
2. **""कुलदेवता बताउने""** (telling the deity) - Machine translation: ""is a dadhura shrine that has godseera"" is a misinterpretation. It should be translated as ""telling the story of the deity"" or ""mentioning the deity.""

Step 1: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- जनयुद्धक्रममा (January uprising)
- पासाङले (by Pasang)
- धेरैपटक (many times)
- आफ्नो मृत्युको खबर (news of his own death)
- सुन्नुभएको (heard)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""During the January uprising, pasang was heard by himself many times during his death.""
- Reference translation: ""During the People 's War, Pasang had heard the news of his own death many times.""

Differences:
1. ""January uprising"" vs ""People's War"": The machine translation uses ""January uprising"" while the reference translation specifies ""People's War,"" which is a more accurate term for the historical context in Nepal.
2. ""by Pasang"" vs ""Pasang had"": The machine translation places ""by himself"" after ""pasang,"" which implies that Pasang was hearing the news, whereas the reference translation correctly uses ""Pasang had heard"" to indicate that Pasang was the one hearing the news.
3. ""during his death"" vs ""many times"": The machine translation combines ""many times"" with ""during his death,"" which is awkward, while the reference translation separates them for better clarity.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of cultural context, proper grammar, and sentence structure. The differences highlight the need for a translation that respects the nuances of the source text and maintains the meaning in the target language.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: If they are killed, every object we possess will be stained with blood.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""redemption"" (redeemed by blood), which is not present in the source text. The source text talks about ""रगतले"" (stained) or ""मुछिएको"" (eaten), which implies a connection to the consumption of blood, not redemption.
- The machine translation omits the word ""वस्तु"" (objects) from the source, which is crucial to convey the meaning of ""every"" in this context.
- The reference translation uses ""every object"" (every objects), which is a more accurate and natural translation of ""हरेक वस्तु"" in English.

|Analysis|
1. **Event description**: The source text mentions a ""विरगन्जमा सुवर्णशमशेरलाई सभापति बनाई"" (chairman made in Birgunj), while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""making goldsmiths chair in wirganj"". The reference translation correctly identifies the event as a ""General Convention"" and specifies Birgunj as the location.
2. **Time and date**: The source text gives the dates as ""२०१२ माघ १० र ११मा"" (10 and 11 Magh 2012), which is a specific Nepali calendar reference. The machine translation omits this information, while the reference translation includes it.
3. **Subject identification**: The source text refers to ""सुवर्णशमशेरलाई सभापति"" (Suvarna Shumsher as the chairman), which is a person's name. The machine translation does not mention the name, while the reference translation does.

In summary, the machine translation has significant differences in event description, time and date, and subject identification compared to the reference translation. The machine translation incorrectly translates the event and omits important details, leading to a lower quality translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: माथि नै बताइसकिएको छ कि खसहरू आर्य हुन् तर बैदिक आर्य होइनन्।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Upon being told that the roughs are astonished, but not a purpose.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: It is stated above that Khas are Ayras but not Vedic Aryas.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the source text
- The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the meaning of ""माथि नै बताइसकिएको"" (upon being told) and translated it as ""Upon being told that.""
- It has also misinterpreted ""खसहरू आर्य हुन् तर बैदिक आर्य होइनन्"" (Khas are Ayras but not Vedic Aryas) as ""the roughs are astonished, but not a purpose.""

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation has lost the context of the statement about Khas being Ayras but not Vedic Aryas, which is a factual claim in the source text.
- It has translated ""तर"" (but) as ""but not a purpose,"" which is a nonsensical phrase and does not convey the intended contrast.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is of poor quality because it fails to accurately convey the meaning and context of the source text. It incorrectly translates key phrases and presents a nonsensical interpretation of the relationship between Khas and Aryan groups.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
The source text is: ""सामाजिक न्यायका आधारमा आर्थिक संवृद्धिका लागि भूमि सुधार र औद्योगिकरण गर्ने,"" which translates to ""Land reform and industrialization for economic development based on social justice.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
Machine translation: ""The land reform and industrialization for economic cooperation on the basis of\tsamaic Justice,""
Reference translation: ""Land reform and industrialization for economic prosperity on the basis of social justice.""

Difference analysis:
1. The machine translation uses ""economic cooperation"" instead of ""economic development"" which is less precise and might imply a different focus.
2. The machine translation has ""\tsamaic Justice"" which seems to be a typo or incorrect reference to ""social justice"" in the source text. The reference translation correctly uses ""social justice.""

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the more accurate term ""economic development"" instead of ""cooperation"" and the correct translation of ""सामाजिक न्यायका"" as ""social justice."" The machine translation also has a potential typo with ""\tsamaic Justice"" which should be removed or corrected to match the reference translation.

|Reference translation: In May 2017 , when The Miz and his wife Mary came to RAW , the tension between them had increased again .|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation has a misunderstanding of the phrase ""मरिसपनि रमा"" (Marysecame too), which is likely a name or a term that the translator is not familiar with. It translates it as ""increased reinforcements,"" which is incorrect.
2. The machine translation also incorrectly interprets the context of ""उनीहरूको बीच"" (between them) as a military or sports term, translating it as ""between them after they came to ruin."" In the reference translation, it is translated as ""the tension between them,"" which is more appropriate for the context of a personal relationship.
3. The machine translation omits the phrase ""आएपछि"" (after they came), which is crucial for understanding the timing of the events.

Overall, the machine translation is not accurate in capturing the meaning and context of the source text, leading to a significant difference from the reference translation.

Source: त्यस्तै ऊ खरिदबिक्री, कमिसन वा दलालीको क्षेत्रमा संलग्न छ भने पटकपटक मिहिनेत गरेर कमाएको रकम घाटा परेर एकै पटकमा गुमाउनु पर्ने हुन्छ ।
Machine translation: Similarly he is involved in the area of buying, commissioning, or brokerage, the amount of money committed by ministers is to be lost at one time.

|im_sep| Difference: The machine translation omits the phrase ""पटकपटक मिहिनेत गरेर"" (gradually over a month) from the source text, which is crucial for conveying the context of the loss happening slowly. It also changes ""कमाएको रकम"" (earned money) to ""the amount of money committed by ministers,"" which is not directly supported by the source.

|im_sep| Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation|
Machine translation: Similarly he is involved in the area of buying, commissioning, or brokerage, the amount of money committed by ministers is to be lost at one time.
Reference translation: Similarly, if he is involved in the field of buying and selling, commission or brokerage, he will have to lose the hard earned money at once.

|im_sep| Difference: The reference translation captures the essence of the source text more accurately by including ""पटकपटक मिहिनेत गरेर"" (gradually over a month) and maintaining the meaning of ""कमाएको रकम"" (earned money) as ""hard earned money."" It also uses ""at once"" to convey the same idea as ""परेर एकै पटकमा गुमाउनु पर्ने हुन्छ"" (will have to lose it all at one time).

|Reference translation: In the current day, the expansion of patna town has been expanded to the west and mixed up with danapur.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text states that the expansion of Patna city has ""भएको छ"" (has happened) in the west, which implies growth or development. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""severed to the west,"" suggesting a division or interruption, which is not the intended meaning.
2. The reference translation uses ""expanded to the west"" to convey the growth direction, which is more accurate than the machine translation's ""severed.""
3. The phrase ""यो दानापुरसँग गएर मिलेको छ"" (mixed up with Danapur) in the source indicates that the expansion has merged with Danapur. The machine translation omits this part, making it unclear that the two areas have become intertwined.

|Machine translation: This smoking is more accurate to natives than people who do not smoke COPD's natives.|
|Reference translation: COPD is more common in relatives who smoke than in people who are not related and who smoke.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text discusses the increased risk of COPD in people who smoke compared to those who do not smoke and are not related.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""नाता नलाग्ने"" (natives who do not smoke) as ""people who do not smoke COPD's natives,"" which is a confusing and inaccurate phrase. It should be translated as ""people who are not related and who smoke.""
3. The machine translation also reverses the meaning, stating that smoking is ""more accurate"" to natives, which does not make sense in the context of the health risk.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is of poor quality due to its incorrect interpretation of the source text, specifically in the handling of the relationship between smoking, COPD, and native speakers. The reference translation accurately conveys the intended meaning, emphasizing the higher prevalence of COPD in smoking relatives compared to unrelated smokers.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Until the 19th century, the place was ruled by Nepalese and Sikkimese; Some Lepcha communities also inhabited there.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- Machine translation: ""states of nepali and sikmi"" vs ""ruled by Nepalese and Sikkimese"" - The machine translation suggests that the place was composed of states, while the reference translation indicates that it was under the rule of these two entities.
- Machine translation: ""some of the lepcha community was also inhabited"" vs ""Some Lepcha communities also inhabited there"" - The machine translation omits the plural form ""communities"" and adds the unnecessary ""also"" before ""inhabited.""

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the relationship between the place and the Nepalese and Sikkimese rule, and in the description of the Lepcha presence. The machine translation incorrectly suggests that the place was composed of states, while the reference states that it was ruled.

|Machine translation: In 1919 Gora government granted her father the rights from her own lands and money.|
|Reference translation: In 1919 , the Government of the Whites dismissed his father the rights from her own lands and money.|

Analysis:

1. **Time reference**: The machine translation uses ""granted"" while the reference translation uses ""dismissed."" The source text does not specify whether the action was granting or dismissing, but the context suggests that the father lost his rights, which is more consistent with ""dismissed"" than ""granted.""

2. **Subject**: The machine translation refers to ""her father"" (her) while the reference translation uses ""his father"" (his). The gender is not clear from the source text, but based on the context, it is more likely to be ""his"" since the father is being dismissed, which implies a male subject.

3. **Government**: The machine translation mentions ""Gora government"" while the reference translation specifies ""the Government of the Whites."" The source does not explicitly mention the ethnicity of the government, but ""Gora"" is a Nepali name, and it's reasonable to assume the context refers to a Nepalese government, so ""the Government of the Whites"" might be an incorrect interpretation.

4. **Action**: The machine translation states that the father was granted rights, while the reference translation implies that the rights were taken away. The source text does not clearly state the action, but the context leans towards the latter.

Based on this analysis, the machine translation has differences in the interpretation of the action (granting vs. dismissing), the subject's gender, and the specific government referred to. The reference translation seems to better capture the intended meaning, especially in terms of the negative connotation of the action.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Thus, you have to spend time with the small children in the family.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""तसर्थ"" (thus), which is a crucial connector that sets the context.
- The machine translation uses ""the young little ones"" instead of ""साना केटाकटीहरु"" (small children), which is a more specific term in the Nepali text.
- The machine translation has a slightly awkward phrasing, ""are in the family"" instead of ""समय बिताउनु र्दिछ"" (have to spend time), which doesn't convey the sense of obligation or necessity as in the reference.

|Analysis|
1. **Subject and action**: In the source, the subject is ""मोतीराम भट्ट"" (Motiram Bhatt) and the action is ""भारतेन्दुको सम्पर्कमा पुगे"" (came in contact with Bharatendu).

Step 1: Understand the source text
The source text is in Nepali and says, ""छिमेकी बिहारको भोजपुरी शैलीको होली पनि चित्ताकर्षक हुन्छ।"" This translates to ""The Holi of the Chimeki area, in the Bhojpuri style of Bihar, is also captivating.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation says, ""The neighborhood is also known as the holiest style of bihar."" This suggests that the Holi is considered the holiest style, which is not accurate according to the source text. The source text emphasizes the Bhojpuri style, not the holiness of the style.

Step 3: Compare the reference translation
The reference translation, ""The Bhojpuri-typed Holi of the neighborhood Bihar is also attractive,"" captures the essence of the source text by mentioning the Bhojpuri style and the attractiveness of the Holi in the Chimeki area of Bihar.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the emphasis on the Bhojpuri style being the holiest, which is not present in the source text. The reference translation correctly conveys the Bhojpuri connection and the appeal of the Holi.

Source: यो गीतमा दुई जना मादले, दुई जना मारूनी र पुरसिङ्गे नाच्ने गर्छन् ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: This song consists of two meadows, two maroons and a purushinge dance.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In this song, two Madale, two Maruni, and Pursinge dance.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation has ""two meadows"" which is a direct translation of ""दुई जना मादले"" but it's not the correct context. In the source, ""मादले"" refers to a musical instrument, not meadows.
- The machine translation has ""a purushinge dance"" which is a possible interpretation of ""पुरसिङ्गे नाच्ने"", but the reference translation separates ""Pursinge"" as a separate noun, likely indicating a dance form or a person's name, while the machine combines it with ""dance.""
- The reference translation uses ""In this song"" as a natural English phrase to introduce the subject, which is missing in the machine translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the interpretation of ""मादले"" (as a musical instrument instead of meadows), the separation of ""Pursinge"" as a distinct element, and the inclusion of ""In this song"" for context. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the meaning and structure of the original Nepali text.

|Reference translation: The Khayar tree is considered to be the symbol of the Mrigashira constellation and a person born in the Mrigashira constellation can live a positive life by worshiping the Khayar tree.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""खयरको वृक्षलाई मृगशिरा नक्षत्रको प्रतीक"" (the Khaira tree as a symbol of the Mrigashira constellation), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""the khaira nobility.""
2. The reference translation correctly identifies the Mrigashira constellation, not the khaira nobility, as the context for the symbol.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: त्यस्ता दुर्भावनाहरूलाई नवदुर्गाको मन्दिरमा लगेर चढाउँ अर्थात् त्यागौं भन्ने शास्त्रीय मान्यता हो ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Such disturbances are the classical assumption that the ride was originally abandoned by taking place in the temple of navdurga.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: It is a classical belief that such bad feelings should be taken to the temple of Nava Durga and offered.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation states ""the ride was originally abandoned"" while the source text and reference translation imply a more general idea of ""bad feelings"" being taken to the temple.
- The machine translation uses ""taking place"" instead of ""offered"" in the reference translation, which changes the meaning slightly, as the reference suggests an act of offering rather than just occurring.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the specific meaning of ""bad feelings"" and the action of taking them to the temple. The machine translation suggests a physical act of abandonment, while the reference translation emphasizes the act of offering, which is a more common cultural interpretation in the context of a religious belief.

|Source: देउडा खेलमा विशेष गरेर मायाप्रेम, विरह व्यथा, मानसिक भावहरूको अभिव्यक्ति तथा लोक जीवनका मार्मिक स्वरहरू प्रस्तुत भएको पाउन सकिन्छ ।|

|Reference translation: In Deuda game, especially love, separation pain, expression of mental feelings, and touching voices of folk life are found to be presented.|
|Analysis:|
1. **""देउडा खेलमा""** (In Deuda game) - Machine translation: ""Mayaprem, worship adventure, specializing in deoda games"" - The source text refers to a game, while the machine translation incorrectly associates it with Mayaprem (a name) and a worship adventure.
2. **""विशेष गरेर""** (especially) - Machine translation: Missing in the translation. This phrase is crucial to convey the emphasis on a particular aspect.
3. **""मायाप्रेम""** (love) - Machine translation: Incorrectly translated as ""worship adventure"" instead of love, which is the main theme in the context of the Deuda game.
4. **""विरह व्यथा""** (separation pain) - Machine translation: Present but not clearly translated as ""separation pain.""
5. **""मानसिक भावहरूको अभिव्यक्ति""** (expression of mental feelings) - Machine translation: Translated as ""expressions of mental vows,"" which is not accurate. It should be about mental feelings.
6. **""लोक जीवनका मार्मिक स्वरहरू""** (touching voices of folk life) - Machine translation: Translated as ""folk life,"" but the original phrase includes the adjective ""touching"" which is missing.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of understanding the context, maintaining the correct meaning, and conveying the nuances of the source text. The translation should focus on the game's aspects related to love, separation, mental expressions, and the emotional impact of folk life, rather than associating it with unrelated concepts like worship and mental vows.

|Machine translation: The Country's traditional two deliberate hardships were criticized by the church of government.|
|Reference translation: The country 's traditional two-party puppet government was badly criticized.|

|Analysis|
1. **""देशको"" (country's)**: Both translations capture the possessive form correctly, but the machine translation uses ""the church of government"" instead of ""two-party"" to describe the target of criticism.
2. **""परम्परागत"" (traditional)**: Both translations include this term, but the machine translation omits the context, which is ""two-party"" in the reference translation.
3. **""दुई दलीय"" (two-party)**: The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""two deliberate hardships,"" which is not accurate. It should be translated as ""two-party"" to convey the political context.
4. **""कठपुतली"" (puppet government)**: The machine translation uses ""church"" instead of ""puppet government,"" which is a significant error, as it changes the meaning from a political metaphor to a religious institution.
5. **""सरकारको चर्को"" (the government's criticism)**: The machine translation has this phrase, but it's not clear and could be interpreted as a literal church criticism, whereas the reference translation uses ""was badly criticized"" to express the severity of the criticism.
6. **""आलोचना गरेका थिए"" (were criticized)**: Both translations convey the past tense of the action, but the machine translation does not clearly express the severity of the criticism as in the reference translation.

In summary, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation by misinterpreting the political context, using ""church"" instead of ""two-party puppet government,"" and not conveying the severity of the criticism. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

|Machine translation: It is better to save from the serpent's token than to preach after the serpent's token.|
|Reference translation: It is better not to be bitten by a snake than to be treated after snake has bitten you.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Translation of ""सर्पको टोकाईपछि""**: The source text refers to ""after the serpent's token,"" which likely means ""after being bitten by a snake"" (in the context of a bite). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""to preach after the serpent's token,"" which is unrelated to the original meaning.

2. **Translation of ""उपचार गर्नुभन्दा""**: The source text means ""than to treat,"" referring to the action of receiving treatment after being bitten. The machine translation omits this context and translates it as ""save from the serpent's token,"" which is not a suitable equivalent.

3. **Translation of ""बच्नु नै उत्तम हो""**: The source text states that it is better not to be bitten (bच्नु) in the first place, which is translated as ""to save from the serpent's token"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly conveys the idea of avoiding the bite.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of understanding the context and accurately conveying the meaning of the source text. The machine translation incorrectly interprets the phrase ""उपचार गर्नुभन्दा"" and loses the nuance of the original statement, which is about the preference for prevention over treatment after a snake bite.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: त्यसैले सर्प देख्नासाथ त्रसित हुनु आवश्यक छैन तर सतर्क भने हुनैपर्छ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: So the serpent is not required to be quartered, but must be alerted.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: That is why, you don't have to be scared when you see a snake, but you have to be careful.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation states ""the serpent is not required to be quartered,"" which is a literal interpretation and does not convey the intended meaning of the source text. The source text is about not being frightened by a snake, not about dividing it.
- The reference translation correctly conveys the idea that one doesn't need to be overly scared but should be cautious when encountering a snake.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation misses the context of not being scared (त्रसित हुनु आवश्यक छैन) and instead translates it as ""not required to be quartered,"" which is unrelated.
- The reference translation captures the nuance of being careful (सतर्क भने हुनैपर्छ) instead of being frightened.

Conclusion: The machine translation is significantly different from the reference translation in terms of conveying the intended meaning and context. The source text discusses the need for caution rather than fear or the act of quartering a snake.

**Analysis:**

1. **""प्रवेशआज्ञा""**: In the source, this term refers to ""entry permit"" or ""permission to enter."" The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""permissions,"" which is a broader term and does not specifically convey the idea of a permit.

2. **""अनुमतिको""**: The source uses this term to indicate ""of permission."" The machine translation omits this possessive form, making it unclear that the fees are related to the permission.

3. **""फरक हुन्छ""**: This phrase means ""differ"" or ""are different."" The machine translation accurately captures this meaning.

4. **""प्रकार""**: Both the source and reference translation correctly use this term to mean ""type.""

5. **""शुल्क""**: The source and both translations correctly use this term for ""fees.""

6. **""ठाउँ ठाउँ""**: This phrase is informal and emphasizes the point that the differences apply to different places. The machine translation does not capture this emphasis, using ""place place"" instead.

In summary, the machine translation loses some precision in terms of the specific permit-related context and informal emphasis, and omits the possessive form in ""अनुमतिको."" The overall meaning is conveyed, but with some nuances lost.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: दण्डीले सर्गका साथै तीन मङ्गलाचरण सुरुमा हुनुपर्छ भन्दै नयाँ मान्यता थपेका छन् ।
Machine translation: The punishment added a new assumption that the three mongols must be initially involved with the serg.

Step 2: Identify differences in translation.
- In the source, ""सर्गका साथै"" (with the sarga) is translated as ""the serg"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate. It should be translated as ""along with the sarga.""
- ""तीन मङ्गलाचरण"" (three mangalacharans) is translated as ""the three mongols"" in the machine translation, which is a mistranslation. ""मङ्गलाचरण"" refers to rituals or ceremonies, not mongols.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: Dandi has added a new belief saying that three mangalacharans should be performed at the beginning along with the Sarga.

Step 4: Analyze the discrepancies.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""सर्गका साथै"" as ""initially involved with the serg"" instead of ""along with the sarga.""
- The machine translation mistranslates ""तीन मङ्गलाचरण"" as ""the three mongols"" when it should be ""three mangalacharans.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of high quality due to the incorrect interpretation of ""सर्गका साथै"" and the mistranslation of ""तीन मङ्गलाचरण.""

|Reference translation: In the partition of India (Harijan) newspaper on October 6, 1946, he wrote about making the partition of India to Pakistan at the point of 6 October.|

Analysis:
1. The source text uses ""पत्रिकामा"" (magazine), while the machine translation uses ""Magazine"" without the local term. The reference translation correctly includes ""newspaper"" instead, which is a more accurate term for the context in Nepali.
2. The machine translation omits the word ""पत्रिकामा"" (newspaper) from the source, which is a crucial detail in the reference translation.
3. The phrase ""उनले ६ अक्टोबरको अंकमा"" (he wrote at the point of 6 October) is translated as ""at the point of 6 October"" in the machine translation, which is a less precise translation than the reference's ""on October 6"".
4. The reference translation has a more natural flow and structure, while the machine translation has some awkward phrasing.

|Reference translation: He indicated that they were not as bad as normal because they were filled with air and the airways were filled with sputum.|

|Analysis|
1. **""उहाँले सूचीत गर्नु भएको थियो""** (He noted) - Machine: ""He noted"" - Reference: ""He indicated""
   Difference: Machine uses ""noted"" which is a general term, while the reference uses ""indicated"" which is more specific and contextually appropriate.

2. **""तिनीहरु सामन्य जस्तो बिग्रेका थिएनन्""** (they were not as broken as normal) - Machine: ""they were not as broken as normal"" - Reference: ""they were not as bad as normal""
   Difference: ""Biggereka"" in the source text refers to a condition or state, while ""broken"" in the machine translation is a literal translation that might not convey the intended meaning. The reference translation uses ""bad"" which is more suitable.

3. **""किनभने""** (why) - Machine: Not present - Reference: Not present
   Difference: The source text includes ""kinbhane"" which is a question particle, but the machine translation omits it, making the sentence less clear.

4. **""तिनीहरू हावाले भरिएका थिए""** (they were filled with air) - Machine: ""they were filled with wind"" - Reference: ""they were filled with air""
   Difference: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""hawale"" (air) as ""wind,"" which is not the same thing.

5. **""र वायुमार्ग खकारले भरिएको थियो""** (and the airways were filled with sputum) - Machine: ""and dangerous in the air"" - Reference: ""and the airways were filled with sputum""
   Difference: The machine translation omits the mention of ""sputum"" and instead translates it as ""dangerous in the air,"" which is not accurate.

- Place: मोरङ (Morang) and बिजयपुर (Bijayapur)
- Individuals: राजा (King), राय (Raaya), बुद्धिकर्ण (Buddhistikarna), खेवाङको (Khewang)

- Reference translation: In 1833 BS, King of Morang, Dewan Buddhikarna Raaya Khewang of Bijayapur were killed.

Step 3: Analyze differences
- Year: The machine translation omits the ""BS"" (Baisakh Samvat) from the Nepali calendar, which is crucial for understanding the context.
- Place: The machine translation combines ""मोरङ"" (Morang) and ""बिजयपुर"" (Bijayapur) into a single phrase ""morong and bijapur"" without specifying the roles of each place (one being the king's kingdom and the other the location of the Dewan).
- Individuals: The machine translation combines ""राजा"" (King) and ""राय"" (Raaya) into ""Devan Buddhist Raja,"" which is not accurate. In the reference, these are separate individuals: King of Morang and Dewan Buddhikarna Raaya.
- Verb tense: The machine translation uses ""murdered"" in the past tense, while the reference uses ""were killed"" which is also past tense but more suitable for a historical context.

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences in terms of cultural context, proper naming of places and individuals, and the inclusion of the Nepali calendar. The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate representation of the source text.

Analysis:
1. **""अनेकौं अंगहरू""** (many organs) - Machine translation: ""the members of the multitude of these members"" - The reference translation specifies ""organs"" directly, while the machine translation refers to ""members"" which is less specific and could imply any type of members, not necessarily organs.

3. **""नेपाली हुनुमा गौरव मान्दै""** (has come to be proud to be Nepali) - Machine translation: ""has come to be glorious in Nepali"" - The machine translation uses ""glorious"" which does not convey the same sense of pride as the reference translation. ""Proud"" is a more accurate translation of the Nepali sentiment.
4. **Overall structure** - The machine translation is more formal and less idiomatic, which can affect the readability and naturalness of the sentence.

|Analysis|
1. **Subject**: In the source, the subject is ""त्यसले"" (Tyasale, meaning ""therefore"" or ""thus""), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation starts with ""He"", which is a suitable subject for the action.
2. **Action**: The verb ""दे दिए"" (dide dide, meaning ""gave"" or ""issued"") is translated as ""commanded"" in the machine translation, which is accurate.
3. **Object**: The object ""शिवाजी महाराजका पितालाई बन्दी बनाउने"" (Shivaji Maharajka pitālai bāndī banaune, meaning ""to make the father of Shivaji the King a prisoner"") is not word-for-word translated. The machine translation omits the verb ""to be"" and the passive construction, resulting in ""the father of Shivaji the King"" instead of ""to be taken prisoner.""
4. **Punctuation and structure**: The machine translation lacks the apostrophe in ""Shivaji Maharaj's"" and the passive construction, which are present in the reference translation.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the subject, the passive construction, and the punctuation.

2. **Action description**: The source mentions ""जुम्ला चलान गरिएका"" (sent to Jumla) and ""पाल्पाबाट कम्युनिस्ट पार्टीबाट निर्वाचित"" (elected from the Communist Party). The machine translation incorrectly states ""jumla run from palpi"" and ""a lowly witness from the communist party of palpi at 015"", which does not convey the same meaning.
3. **Time reference**: The source specifies ""०१५ मा"" (2015), which is crucial context for understanding the election. The machine translation omits this information, making it unclear when the event took place.
4. **Position and witness status**: The source states that Kamal Raj Regmi is the ""दोस्रा साक्षी"" (second witness). The machine translation does not mention this, leaving the reader unsure about his position.

In summary, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of subject identification, action description, time reference, and the witness status. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: जब कृषक आफ्नो खेतमा सुनौलो फसल उमारेर अन्न रूपी संपत्ति घरमा ल्याउँने समय जब हुन्छ तब उसको खुशी एवं उमंगको सीमा हुँदैन।
Machine translation: When the farmer grows up in his field, the time of the golden age is to bring the corn into the house. His gladness is no limit.

Step 2: Identify differences.
- The machine translation has ""grows up"" instead of ""grew up"" (past tense in the source), which changes the meaning slightly.
- ""सुनौलो फसल"" (golden crops) is translated as ""grows up in his field"" in the machine translation, which omits the adjective ""golden"" and the noun ""crops.""
- ""उमारेर अन्न रूपी संपत्ति"" (the corn as a valuable asset) is translated as ""the corn into the house,"" losing the context of the asset and the action of bringing it in.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation.
Reference translation: When the farmer grew up the golden crops in his field & the time is to bring the corn into the house then his gladness has no limit.

Step 4: Analyze the quality.
The machine translation has some inaccuracies in terms of tense, word choice, and context. It does not capture the full meaning and nuance of the source text, particularly the description of the golden crops and the significance of bringing them home.

Conclusion: The machine translation's quality is lower than the reference translation due to differences in tense, loss of detail, and a less accurate representation of the source text's meaning.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: कसै कसैले कोटिलास्थानलाई छोडेर डुङ्गेश्वरलाई पञ्चकोशी भित्र समेटेको पनि पाइन्छ ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: It is also found that someone leaves the cotillace, and the dung God is summoned inside the punch.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Some have included Dungeshwar instead of Kotilasthan within Panchkoshi.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation mentions ""cotillace"" which is not a term found in the source text. It seems to be a mistranslation or a word that does not exist in the Nepali context.
- The machine translation says ""the dung God is summoned inside the punch,"" which is not directly reflected in the source text. The source text implies that Dungeshwar is being included in Panchkoshi, not that it is being summoned.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""छोडेर"" (leaving) and ""भित्र समेटेको"" (including inside) and captures the meaning that Dungeshwar is being included instead of Kotilasthan.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the interpretation of ""cotillace"" and the action of ""summoning the dung God."" The reference translation more accurately conveys the meaning of the source text, which is about including Dungeshwar within Panchkoshi.

|Source: नेपालमा यो पर्व धुमधाम गरी, अरू ठुला चाडहरू जस्तै रमाइन्छ।|
|Machine translation: In Nepal, this festival is celebrated by smoking, like other smuggling feasts.|
|Reference translation: In Nepal , this festival is celebrated with pomp and like other big festivals.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""यो पर्व धुमधाम गरी"" (this festival is celebrated with smoke), which implies a traditional or symbolic use of smoke, not actual smoking as a part of the celebration.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""धुमधाम"" as ""smoking"" (which implies illegal or illicit activities), while the reference translation captures the meaning as ""with pomp"" or a grand celebration.
3. The phrase ""अरू ठुला चाडहरू"" (like other big festivals) is not translated accurately by the machine, which suggests smuggling feasts instead of referring to the scale or grandeur of the festival.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation deviates from the reference translation in several aspects. It incorrectly interprets the smoke as illegal smuggling, misses the cultural context of the festival being celebrated with grandeur, and does not convey the comparison to other significant festivals. The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate representation of the source text.

|Machine translation: And it came to pass, when Joni was full of body, that Joni was loosed, and his men were loosed.|
|Reference translation: His body became full of vagina and his penis disappeared.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text is in Nepali, discussing a situation where a person's body is filled with something (yoni, which is a term for vagina in Nepali) and their penis disappears.
2. The machine translation attempts to convey the same idea but with a literal and awkward phrasing in English, using ""Joni"" as a subject, which is likely a name or a placeholder, and ""his men"" as a metaphorical translation for ""penis.""
3. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""योनी भए"" (yoni became) as ""Joni was loosed,"" which does not make sense in the context. The correct translation should be something like ""his body became full of yoni.""
4. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning by translating ""शरीर भरी"" (body became full) and ""पुरुष यौनाङ्ग लुप्त"" (penis disappeared) as ""His body became full of vagina"" and ""his penis disappeared.""

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. It uses a confusing subject (Joni), a literal and awkward phrasing, and incorrectly translates the meaning of ""योनी भए"" and ""पुरुष यौनाङ्ग लुप्त"" into English. The reference translation provides a more accurate and natural translation that reflects the original Nepali text.

|Machine translation: At one time Carthage had desolate labour in the absence of tradition, from which tradition reaped his fellow sideways.|
|Reference translation: Once Kartavirya had destroyed the ashram in Parashuram 's absence, because of which Parashuram angrily cut off his thousand arms.|

|Analysis|
1. **Source**: The source text is about a Nepali historical event involving a character named Kartavirya and Parashuram, discussing the destruction of an ashram due to Parashuram's anger.
2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly identifies ""Carthage"" as the subject, which is a reference to a city in ancient history, not the character Kartavirya. It also translates ""अनुपस्थिति"" (absence) as ""tradition"" and ""क्रोधित"" (angry) as ""reaped his fellow sideways,"" which are incorrect interpretations.

|Reference translation: Therefore, it is practice to worship Bhagwati for nine days of Dasain and receive tika and jamara as offerings on the tenth day.|

|Analysis|
1. The machine translation omits the word ""दसैंका"" (Dasain), which refers to a specific festival in the context. This is important for understanding the duration of the worship.
2. The machine translation uses ""tithes"" instead of ""जमरा"" (jamara), which is a Nepali term for a type of offering, not a financial contribution.
3. The machine translation uses ""jams"" instead of ""जमरा"" (jamara), which is a misspelling or incorrect translation of the Nepali term.
4. The machine translation does not include the word ""प्रसादस्वरूप"" (prasadasvarup), which means ""in the form of offerings"" or ""as offerings,"" which is crucial to convey the purpose of receiving tika and jamara on the tenth day.

Overall, the machine translation loses some cultural context and nuances, and there are errors in specific terms. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the source text.

2. **Action description**: The source text uses ""ठूलो प्रभाव"" (great influence), which is a subjective term, while the machine translation uses ""having a great influence"" which is more objective but loses the nuance of the original.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: यस व्रतबाट मोह आदि संपूर्ण बन्धनहरू नष्ट हुन पुग्छन।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Throughout this betrayal, moh etc. The bindings of the betrayal are destroyed.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: From this fasting, all the bonds like infatuation etc. are eliminated.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""betrayal"" (which is ""भ्रष्टाचार"" in Nepali) as a subject, while the source text doesn't specify a subject for ""मोह"" (infatuation) and ""संपूर्ण बन्धनहरू"" (all bonds). The reference translation assumes ""fasting"" (व्रत) as the context for the elimination of bonds.
- The machine translation translates ""नष्ट हुन पुग्छन"" (are destroyed) as ""are destroyed"", while the reference translation uses ""are eliminated"" which conveys a similar meaning but with a slightly different nuance.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of subject and context. It does not clearly specify the cause of the destruction of bonds (infatuation from fasting) as the reference does. Additionally, the choice of words ""destroyed"" and ""eliminated""虽然相近，但后者在中文里可能更准确地表达出解除或消除关系的含义。 Overall, the machine translation could be improved by providing a more specific context and a more precise translation of ""नष्ट हुन पुग्छन"".

|Reference translation: Although ELPV had no immediate action plan, they wanted to find a way between the Red Flag Party's extremist left and the government's capitalist policy.|
|Analysis:|
1. **""तत्कालिन कुनै कार्ययोजना""** (immediate action plan) - Machine translation: ""there were no actions immediately following the elpv""
   Reference translation: ""no immediate action plan""
   Difference: The machine translation omits the word ""कार्ययोजना"" (action plan) and instead uses ""actions"" which is a broader term, potentially losing the specific context.

2. **""रेड फ्ल्याग पार्टीको उग्रवामपन्थी""** (extremist left of the Red Flag Party) - Machine translation: ""the rise of the Red Flag Party""
   Reference translation: ""Red Flag Party's extremist left""
   Difference: The machine translation does not capture the nuance of the party's ideology being extreme, only mentioning the party's rise.

3. **""सरकारको पूँजिवादी नीतिको""** (capitalist policies of the government) - Machine translation: ""the government's capitalist policy""
   Reference translation: ""the government's capitalist policy""
   Difference: Both translations are similar, but the reference translation maintains the word ""नीतिको"" (policies) which implies a broader scope of the government's capitalist approach.

|Machine translation: After the breakup, children are considered to be in joint negotiations.|
|Reference translation: Children are considered to be under joint supervision after divorce.|

|Analysis|
1. **""सम्बन्ध विच्छेद""** (Section on relationship) - The source text refers to a section on a relationship, which is not directly translated as ""breakup"" in the machine translation. Instead, it could imply a broader context like a discussion or an event related to the relationship.
2. **""पछि""** (after) - Both translations convey this time element correctly.
3. **""बच्चाहरु""** (children) - The subject is correctly translated.
4. **""संयुक्त निगरानीमा""** (joint supervision) - The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""joint negotiations,"" which does not convey the same meaning as the reference's ""joint supervision"" for the care of children after a separation.
5. **""रहेको""** (are considered) - Both translations convey the passive voice correctly.
6. **""मानिन्छ""** (I think) - This is a personal opinion or assumption, which is not explicitly stated in the machine translation.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the interpretation of ""संयुक्त निगरानीमा"" (joint supervision), which is crucial for understanding the context. The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""joint negotiations,"" while the reference correctly states that children are under joint supervision after a divorce. Other aspects, such as the broader context of the relationship section, are not explicitly addressed in the machine translation.

|Reference translation: While the Bhatta Brahmins of Pyuthan used to go to worship at the festival of goddess Patan near Tulsipur, India, over time, they started worshiping Goddess Kalika.|

|Analysis|
1. **Timeframe difference**: The machine translation suggests that the Bhatta Brahmins ""neglected"" the Patan Devi's festival, which implies a negative action, while the reference translation states that they ""started worshiping"" Kalika over time, which is a change in tradition, not neglect.
2. **Event description**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""जान्थे भने"" (used to go) as ""were known to have worshipped the kalika devi's revenge,"" which is a misinterpretation of the past action. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""used to go to worship.""
3. **Location**: The machine translation mentions ""Bharat Tulsipur"" as a separate location, while the source and reference translations imply that Tulsipur is near Patan, not two separate locations for the festival.
4. **Context**: The machine translation introduces a concept of ""kalika devi's revenge"" that is not present in the source text, which makes the translation irrelevant to the original context.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of the interpretation of the past action, the absence of the ""revenge"" context, and the location of the festival.

|Machine translation: The Flame house is next to the flame house, on the other edge of the navy brook.|
|Reference translation: There is another Jwala temple on the other side of Nabhi river across the Jwala house.|

Analysis:

1. **Subject and Object**: The source text talks about ""Jwala house"" and ""Nabhi river"" as the main subjects. The machine translation incorrectly refers to a ""navy brook"" instead of ""Nabhi river,"" which is a key difference.

2. **Location relationship**: The source states that the Jwala temple is on the side of the Jwala house across from where Nabhi river opens (i.e., the Jwala house is on one side and the temple is on the other side of the river). The machine translation incorrectly places both the Flame house and the temple next to each other, suggesting they are adjacent, which is not accurate.

3. **Sentence structure**: The reference translation uses a more natural and concise structure in English, indicating the presence of another Jwala temple without specifying the exact location of the Jwala house. The machine translation, on the other hand, is wordy and does not convey the same clarity.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the correct identification of the river (Nabhi vs. navy brook), the relationship between the Jwala house and the temple, and the overall sentence structure. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali text.

|Machine translation: It also makes idols of other goddesses along with it.|
|Reference translation: In addition, idols of other gods and goddesses are also made.|

|Analysis|
1. **""यसका साथै""** (Along with it) - The machine translation uses ""along with it"" which is a direct translation but might sound awkward in English. The reference translation uses ""In addition,"" which is a more natural way to express the same idea.
2. **""अन्य देवी द्वेवताहरूको""** (of other gods and goddesses) - The machine translation combines ""goddesses"" and ""gods"" into one phrase, while the reference separates them. This is a minor difference but clearer in the reference.
3. **""पनि मूर्तिहरू""** (idols) - Both translations use ""idols,"" but the reference omits ""pani"" (literally, water), which is not necessary in the English context.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is generally accurate but could benefit from slight adjustments for better fluency and clarity. The main differences lie in the separation of gods and goddesses and the use of ""In addition"" for a more natural English structure.

- Machine translation: ""Wss service operates towards Rolpa, having been vingri since chalk.""
- Reference translation: ""A bus service has been launched from Chakchake to Bhingri towards Rolpa.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences:
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""चकचके देखि"" (from Chakchake) as ""Wss service operates"" without mentioning the bus service or the direction.
- ""भिंग्री हुदै"" (towards Bhingri) is translated as ""having been vingri since chalk,"" which is not a clear or accurate translation of the phrase.
- The reference translation correctly states that it's a ""bus service"" and that it's ""launched"" (not ""operates"" in the context of being launched).

|Reference translation: It would be helpful for the home organising Ghewa if a person for whom it is not convenient to bring food or alcohol from his / her house brings cash.|

|Analysis|
1. **Food vs. Food or alcohol**: The machine translation uses ""food or jewellery"" while the reference translation uses ""food or alcohol."" The reference is more accurate in this context, as it is more likely that the context is about bringing items for a gathering or event, where alcohol is a common item to bring.

2. **Adaptation vs. Convenience**: The machine translation mentions ""do not adapt"" which is not directly related to the context. The reference translation uses ""for whom it is not convenient,"" which is a more suitable phrase to describe the situation where bringing items is not easy or suitable for the person.

3. **House of representatives vs. His/Her house**: The machine translation refers to ""the house of representatives,"" which is not relevant to the Nepali context. The reference translation correctly uses ""his / her house.""

4. **Cash**: The machine translation does not mention cash, which is the most logical item to bring in the reference translation. The reference translation implies that cash is the preferred contribution when bringing something from home is inconvenient.

In conclusion, the machine translation has several differences from the reference translation, including the choice of items to bring, the description of the person's situation, and the context of the house. The reference translation is more accurate and contextually appropriate.|

|Machine translation: In Gopala Inheritance, the palace of champadeva has four points of 'Ramayana' nine dances.|
|Reference translation: In Gopal 's genealogy, it is stated that four volumes of 'Ramayan' dances and drama were performed during Champadev 's generation.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject**: The source mentions ""चम्पादेवको पालामा"" (Champadev's palace), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""the palace of champadeva"" without specifying the connection to Gopal. The reference translation correctly refers to ""Gopal's genealogy.""
2. **Action**: The source uses ""आयोजना भएको"" (arranged), which implies an event or performance. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""four points of"" without conveying the action of arranging. The reference translation correctly states ""were performed.""
3. **Content**: The source specifies ""चार अङ्कको"" (four volumes), while the machine translation omits this detail and instead mentions ""nine dances,"" which is not supported by the source. The reference translation accurately mentions ""four volumes.""
4. **'रामायण'**: The source uses the term 'रामायण' (Ramayana) as a subject, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as 'Ramayana' without the quotes, which might imply a different meaning. The reference translation correctly keeps it as 'Ramayan' with quotes.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: कसै कसैले यसलाई सर्पको सम्भोगका रूपमा अर्थ्याउँछन्।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Someone means it as a serpent's possessor.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Some interprete it as the intercourse of snakes.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation translates ""सर्पको सम्भोगका रूपमा"" (as a serpent's possessor) as ""a serpent's possessor,"" which is a literal interpretation. The reference translation, however, interprets it as ""the intercourse of snakes,"" which is a metaphorical or cultural understanding of the phrase.
- The source text uses ""कसै कसैले"" (somehow, in some way), which implies a generalization or uncertainty about who interprets it. The machine translation does not capture this nuance.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it provides a literal translation of the phrase, missing the metaphorical interpretation of the ""intercourse of snakes"" and the uncertainty conveyed by ""कसै कसैले."" The reference translation better captures the intended meaning and cultural context of the source text.

|Machine translation: He sent the pseudonym vasudev to his palace by proper honoring rokha leya and his angel gopinyth near the afzal khanate of status.|
|Reference translation: He treated Krishnaji Bhaskar with due respect and kept him in his court and sent his envoy Gopinath to Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation.|

|Analysis|
1. **Difference in treatment of the name**: The machine translation refers to ""pseudonym vasudev"" while the reference translation correctly mentions ""Krishnaji Bhaskar"" as the person being treated with respect.
2. **Misinterpretation of ""रख लिया""**: The machine translation translates ""रख लिया"" as ""sent"" (implying sending something to a location), but it actually means ""kept"" or ""retained"" in the context of keeping someone in the court.
3. **Misinterpretation of ""वस्तुस्थितिको जायजा""**: The machine translation translates this phrase as ""afzal khanate of status"" but it should be understood as ""to take stock of the situation"" or ""to assess the circumstances.""
4. **Translation of ""नजिक पठाईा""**: The machine translation does not provide a clear equivalent for this phrase, which likely means ""near"" or ""in close proximity"" in the context of Gopinath being sent to Afzal Khan.

In summary, the machine translation has significant differences in the treatment of the names, interpretation of certain phrases, and the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali text.

|Machine translation: At his palace, belonging to it, Ruhi was taught a living vision.|
|Reference translation: Under this, the prince was taught the philosophy of life in his court.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""युवराजलाई"" (the prince), while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""Ruhi"" (which is a name, not a prince). This is a significant difference.
2. The source text uses ""अधिनमा"" (belonging to it), which is a possessive phrase, but the machine translation omits this context, making it unclear who or what ""it"" refers to.
3. The phrase ""जिवन दर्शन"" (the philosophy of life) is translated as ""a living vision"" in the machine translation, which is not an accurate translation. The reference translation captures the meaning more precisely.
4. The location of the teaching, ""दरबारमा"" (at his palace), is translated as ""in his court"" in the reference translation, which is a more accurate representation of the Nepali phrase.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: At the end of the battle, the whole army was present without harjit.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In the end, all the troops were present unarmed as there was no win or defeat.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""हारजीत नभएपछि"" (after there was no victory), which is crucial for understanding the context that the troops were present without weapons because of the lack of a clear outcome (win or defeat).
- The reference translation uses ""unarmed"" to convey the absence of weapons, while the machine translation does not explicitly mention this.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation is missing the reason for the troops being present without weapons, which is an important aspect of the source text.
- The reference translation provides a clearer and more complete picture of the situation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not convey the reason for the troops being present without weapons, which is a key point in the source text. The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation.

|Step 1: Compare the sentence structure|
- Source: ""COPD मा स्टेरोइड्सको प्रयोगलाई समर्थन गर्ने प्रमाणहरू"" (Supporting proofs for the use of steroids in COPD)
- Machine translation: ""Proofs supporting the use of steroids in the COPD were published""
- Reference translation: ""Proofs supporting the use of steroids in COPD was published""

The machine translation adds ""were published"" at the end, which is a verb tense that implies a past action, while the reference translation uses ""was published"" to maintain the singular subject-verb agreement with ""proofs"" (which is singular).

|Step 2: Check for accuracy of time expression|
- Source: ""को अन्तमा"" (at the end)
- Machine translation: ""at the end of""
- Reference translation: ""in the late""

Both translations convey the same idea of the end of the 1950s, but the machine translation uses ""at the end of"" which is a more common phrase in English.

|Step 3: Evaluate overall meaning|
- The main difference lies in the verb tense and the slight variation in time expression. The machine translation is slightly less precise in terms of subject-verb agreement, but the overall meaning is clear.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with a minor difference in verb tense and a slightly different time expression. The meaning is preserved, but the reference translation is more grammatically precise.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject identification**: In the source, ""सर्वजीतका छोरा बहादुरसिंह बराल"" refers to ""bahadursingh beral"" who is the son of ""सर्वजीत"" (Sarvajit). The machine translation incorrectly identifies ""सर्वजीतका छोरा"" as ""the son of the Supreme Council"" instead of ""Sarvajit's son"".
2. **Character names**: The machine translation omits the name ""खड्गजीत"" (Khadgajit), which is the son of ""बहादुरसिंह"" (Bahadur Singh) in the source. It also incorrectly attributes the phrase ""did not necessarily follow that way"" to both Bahadur Singh Baral and Khadgajit, while the reference translation separates the actions, with Khadgajit not following the path.
3. **Temporal context**: The source uses ""त्यो बाटो पछ्याएनन्"" (tyo bato pachyae) which implies a temporal context, possibly indicating that the joining of the British Indian Army happened simultaneously or in a specific order. The machine translation does not convey this temporal aspect.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of identifying the correct family relationship, character names, and the temporal context. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

Analysis:

**Analysis:**

1. **Translation of ""तुलसी दल""**: The source text refers to ""तुलसी दल"" which means ""Tulsi seeds"" in Nepali. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""The fruits of the comparison"", which is unrelated to the context.

2. **Translation of ""पूजनको फल""**: The phrase ""पूजनको फल"" means ""the fruit of worship"" in Nepali. The machine translation omits this part, which is crucial for understanding the context.

3. **Translation of ""चार भार""**: ""चार भार"" means ""four loads"" or ""four quantities"" in Nepali. The machine translation correctly translates this as ""four burdens"".

Machine translation: The gods of Teddy are 12 gods of Rai, and the princes and standards.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Kariya 12 gods of Tedi god are Raika Shahi and Khadayat,

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""तेडी देवताका करिया"" (Kariya of Tedi god), which is a compound term referring to the 12 gods.
- The machine translation separates ""तेडी देवताका"" into ""The gods of Teddy"" and ""करिया"" into ""12 gods of Rai"", which is not accurate as ""करिया"" is a possessive form in Nepali, not a separate term for Rai.
- The source text includes ""रैका शाही"" (Raika Shahi) and ""खडायत"" (Khadayat), which are specific qualities or aspects, while the machine translation omits these details.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly captures the compound term ""करिया"" as ""12 gods of Tedi god"" and includes the specific qualities ""रैका शाही"" and ""खडायत"".

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several aspects.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""नक्कली मृत्युु"" which means ""fake death"" in Nepali. The machine translation correctly translates this as ""duplicate death,"" but it might be more accurate to use ""fake"" or ""false"" death to convey the same meaning in English.

Machine translation: If all other songs are danced to the group.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Whereas in all other songs, dancing and singing are done in groups.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the source text
- The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the verb ""नाच्ने"" (nachne, to dance) and translated it as ""are danced to the group"" (implied passive), which is not accurate. The correct interpretation should be that people dance in groups to the songs.

- The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of the source text, using ""whereas"" to contrast the situation and specifying that both dancing and singing occur in groups.

Step 5: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation lacks the nuance of the source text, which contrasts the action of dancing and singing with the group context.
- The reference translation maintains the parallelism and contrast, which is more faithful to the original.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it does not accurately convey the contrast between singing and dancing in groups, and instead presents a passive construction that implies the songs are danced to the group, which is not the intended meaning.

Step 1: Understand the source text
The source text is in Nepali and says, ""पछि ऋग, यजुर र सामवेदलाई त्रयवेद पनि भन्न थालियो ।"" This translates to English as ""Later, Rig, Yajur, and Samaveda were also referred to as Trivandrum.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation provided is: ""Later debates, Jazur and Samweed were also introduced to trivandrum.""
Here, the machine has:
- Misinterpreted ""ऋग"" (Rig) as ""Jazur"" (which is not a correct translation)
- Misinterpreted ""सामवेदलाई"" (Samveda) as ""Samweed"" (a different term)
- Changed ""भन्न थालियो"" (were referred to) to ""introduced to trivandrum"" (which is not an accurate representation of the original meaning)

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation
The reference translation is: ""Later , Rig , Yajur and Samaveda were also called Triveda .""
In the reference translation:
- Rig, Yajur, and Samaveda are correctly translated
- ""भन्न थालियो"" is translated as ""called,"" which is a more accurate representation of the original meaning
- ""त्रयवेद"" is translated as ""Triveda,"" which is the correct term for the context (referring to the three Vedas)

Conclusion:
The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy and terminology. It incorrectly identifies Rig as Jazur, Samveda as Samweed, and does not convey the act of referring to the Vedas as Triveda.

2. **Omission of conjunction**: The source text uses ""नै"" (then) to connect the two clauses, which is not present in the machine translation. However, this is a minor difference and the meaning is still clear.

3. **Tense consistency**: The source text uses the past tense for ""जित्न सफल भए"" (they were successful), while the machine translation uses ""they successfully won"" which is also in the past tense but with an additional adverb ""successfully"". The reference translation uses ""won"" without the adverb, which is also correct.

4. **Word order**: The source text has a slightly different word order, with ""नै"" (then) coming after the clause about joining. The machine translation and reference translation both maintain a similar word order.

2. The word order in the machine translation is slightly different, with ""in the APF"" following ""main striker,"" while the reference translation places ""of APF"" after ""main striker."" This difference is minor and does not affect the overall meaning.

|im_sep| Conclusion:
The machine translation captures the essential information from the source text, with a minor difference in word order. The main difference is the redundancy in the phrase ""at present time,"" which is not present in the reference translation. Overall, the meaning is accurately conveyed, but the reference translation is more concise and natural-sounding.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. |im_end|>

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: तव उ निस्काम कर्म गर्दै जाँदा संसारिक चक्रबाट मुक्त हुन्छ ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Taw is freed from the chemical cycle when he is employed by the niscam.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Then, as he does Niskaam deeds, he will be free from the cycle of the world.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation has ""chemical cycle"" instead of ""cycle of the world"" (संसारिक चक्रबाट मुक्त हुन्छ vs मुक्त हुन्छ संसारिक चक्रबाट).
- The machine translation mentions ""employed by the niscam"" which is not present in the source text. The source text only implies that Niskaam deeds lead to freedom, not employment.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""संसारिक चक्रबाट"" (world cycle) as ""chemical cycle.""
- The machine translation adds the concept of employment by ""niscam"" which is not in the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not accurate in capturing the meaning of the source text, particularly in terms of the world cycle and the context of Niskaam deeds leading to freedom, rather than employment. The reference translation better reflects the original Nepali text.

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
Source: भनिन्छ कि हैहयवंशको अन्त गर्नाको लागी स्वयं भगवानले  परशुरामको रूपमा अंशावतार ग्रहण गरेका थिए ।
Machine translation: It is said that the cost of ending the haihyavats itself was accepted by the goddess as a tradition.

Difference: The machine translation has ""the cost of ending the haihyavats itself"" instead of ""in order to end Haihayabansa"". The reference translation correctly mentions the purpose, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as a cost.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
Reference translation: It is said that in order to end Haihayabansa, God himself had incarnated in the form of Parshuram.

Difference: The reference translation correctly captures the meaning that God took Parshuram's form to accomplish the end of Haihayavansa, whereas the machine translation omits the purpose and instead talks about a cost being accepted by the goddess.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the reason for God's incarnation. The reference translation accurately conveys that it was to end Haihayabansa, while the machine translation incorrectly suggests it was a cost accepted by the goddess as a tradition.

|Machine translation: These idols are said to be of the elders who were brought from the hariri region and ujjain in India.|
|Reference translation: According to the elders, these idols were brought by Shadananda himself from Harihar region and Ujjain of India.|

|Analysis|
1. **Difference in subject**: The machine translation omits the subject ""Shadananda"" from the reference, which is crucial for understanding who brought the idols.
2. **Omission of personal action**: The reference mentions ""by Shadananda himself,"" indicating that Shadananda was the one who brought the idols, while the machine translation does not specify this.
3. **Word order**: The reference maintains the word order ""by Shadananda"" before ""from Harihar region and Ujjain,"" which is clearer than the machine translation's ""who were brought from the hariri region and ujjain.""

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the subject and the personal action attributed to Shadananda, as well as the clarity of the source. The reference provides a more accurate and coherent account of the event.

|Reference translation: In Newar, cleansing is usually done on the fourth or sixth day after the baby is born, but in special cases, cleansing is done the next day.|

|Analysis|
1. **""नेवारहरूमा चोख्याउने काम""** (Act of stealing in nearbies) - Machine translation: ""The act of stealing in nearbies"" - Reference translation: ""Cleansing in Newar""
   Difference: Machine translation incorrectly translates ""चोख्याउने काम"" as ""stealing"" instead of the more appropriate ""cleansing"" or ""purification ceremony"" in the context.

2. **""साधारणतया शिशु जन्मेको चौंथो वा छैंठो दिनमा""** (generally on the fourth or sixth day after the baby is born) - Machine translation: ""on the fourth or sixth day of the shishu birthday"" - Reference translation: ""on the fourth or sixth day after the baby is born""
   Difference: Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation is more clear and natural.

3. **""तथापि""** (however) - Machine translation: ""although"" - Reference translation: Not directly translated, but implied by the contrast.
   Difference: The reference translation does not directly translate ""तथापि"" but uses a more implicit contrast.

4. **""विशेष अवस्था परेमा भोलिपल्ट पनि चोख्याइन्छ""** (special cases are also done the next day) - Machine translation: ""special conditions are also stolen on the morning"" - Reference translation: ""in special cases, cleansing is done the next day""
   Difference: Machine translation incorrectly translates ""भोलिपल्ट पनि चोख्याइन्छ"" as ""stolen on the morning"" when it should be understood as ""done the next day"" in the context of a purification ceremony.

Overall, the machine translation has significant differences in the context and meaning, particularly in the interpretation of ""चोख्याउने काम"" and the handling of the time frame for special cases. The reference translation is more accurate and culturally appropriate.

|im_start|>|im_sep| Analyzing the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. **Source meaning**: The source text talks about someone being successful due to their hard work and the ability to understand (सुझबुझका बलमा), which refers to the intelligence or comprehension that comes into play.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""शनिको अनुकूलतामा"" (in Saturn's adaptation) as ""In Saturn's adaptation,"" which seems to be a literal interpretation that doesn't convey the intended meaning. It also translates ""सुझबुझका बलमा"" as ""suggestive ballads,"" which is a misinterpretation of the context.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation captures the essence of the source by saying ""In favour of Saturn, he is successful only after hard work and strength of understanding,"" which correctly translates the meaning of ""शनिको अनुकूलतामा"" and conveys the idea of understanding.

4. **Accuracy**: The machine translation is not accurate in terms of capturing the context and meaning of the source text, while the reference translation is more faithful.

In conclusion, the machine translation loses the nuance of the original Nepali sentence, particularly in understanding the metaphorical aspect of ""सुझबुझका बलमा"" and the overall meaning of being successful due to hard work and understanding. The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation.

1. The machine translation has a minor error in the verb ""rebuilding"" for the WWE World Championship. The reference translation uses ""win back,"" which is a more accurate expression to convey the idea of regaining something that was lost. The machine translation uses ""rebuilding,"" which suggests a continuous process rather than the act of regaining.

2. The phrase ""पुन जित्ने"" (pun jitenne) in the source text means ""to win again"" or ""to regain,"" which is not directly translated in the machine translation. The reference translation captures this by using ""win back.""

|Reference translation: If a person remains active even at the age of 80, such person is considered to have the specialty of youth.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text uses ""मानिन्छ"" (māninchha), which is a colloquial form of ""mānina"" (मानिन्छ), meaning ""it is believed"" or ""it is considered."" The machine translation omits this informal tone, which is present in the reference translation.
2. The machine translation uses ""a youthful man"" while the reference translation uses ""the specialty of youth."" The reference conveys the idea that being active at 80 is seen as a unique characteristic of youth, rather than just referring to the person as youthful.
3. The phrase ""भने त्यसमा"" (bhane tyasma) in the source text, which means ""if someone says so"" or ""if it is said,"" is not present in the machine translation. This context is important to understand the perspective of the statement.

Overall, the machine translation loses some nuance and cultural context, and does not capture the full meaning of the reference translation.

|Reference translation: At night, it is usual to seem like the flames of fire are burning, and there are sounds of explosions etc.|
|Analysis:|
1. **""राती तिर""** (at night) - Machine translation: ""And the rods of fire shall be as burning in the night"" - The source text refers to the appearance of fire at night, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""rods of fire"" and a metaphor of burning, which is not a direct translation.
2. **""आगोका राँकाहरु""** (flames of fire) - Machine translation: ""the voice of the exploding etiquette"" - The source text describes the flames, not a voice or an exploding etiquette. The machine translation is off-topic.
3. **""देखिनु""** (to seem) - Machine translation: Missing in the machine translation - This verb is crucial for understanding the context, as it implies the appearance or perception of the flames.
4. **""विस्फोट  इत्यादीको आवाज""** (sounds of explosions) - Machine translation: ""the voice of the exploding etiquette"" - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""vistasfot"" (explosions) as ""voice"" and adds ""etiquette,"" which is irrelevant.

- Machine translation: Take the assistance of other experienced women if the problem is caused by breastfeeding.
- Reference translation: If there is a problem while breastfeeding, take the assistance of other experienced women.

Step 2: Identify differences in word order and phrasing
- Source: स्तनपान गराउँदा (breastfeeding) समस्या पथ्र्यो (problem) भने (said) अन्य (other) अनुभवी (experienced) महिलाको (women's) सहयोग (assistance) लिनुहोस् (ask for)
- Machine translation: ""if the problem is caused by breastfeeding"" is inserted as a conditional clause, which is not directly present in the source sentence.

Step 3: Analyze the translation accuracy
- The machine translation captures the main idea that one should seek assistance from experienced women if there's a problem related to breastfeeding, but it rephrases the original sentence structure and adds a conditional clause that is not explicitly stated in the source.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the sentence structure and the addition of a conditional clause. The reference translation maintains a more direct and faithful translation of the source, without altering the meaning significantly. The machine translation could be improved by removing the conditional clause and keeping the original structure, which would be: ""If there is a problem while breastfeeding, seek the assistance of other experienced women.""

2. **Action description**: The source text uses ""उजागर गरेको छ"" (has brought to light), which implies revealing or elaborating. The machine translation omits this aspect, simply stating ""has enjoyed a history of excellence and excellence,"" which does not convey the same meaning.

3. **Person and attribute**: The source mentions ""महर्षि गौतमको"" (Maharshi Gautam's), referring to the excellence and wisdom associated with Gautam. The machine translation does not specify the person, just using ""excellence and excellence,"" while the reference translation clearly attributes these qualities to Gautam.

|Analysis:|
1. The source sentence is in Nepali, and the machine translation attempts to convey the same meaning in English.

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to two specific locations: ""रिडीखोलामा"" (Ridikhola) and ""बाक्ली खोलामा"" (Bakli Khola), which are likely the names of rivers or places associated with waterfalls.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""जलविहार गर्न सक्नुहुन्छ"" (can do Jalbihar) as ""observe the monumental views of falls in bold rivers."" The correct interpretation is that one can perform an activity called ""Jalbihar"" at these locations, not just observe the falls.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation uses ""the National Gandhi memorial is held"" while the reference translation uses ""National Gandhi Memorial Day is celebrated."" The reference translation is more specific and conveys the idea of a day dedicated to celebrating Gandhi's memory, rather than just a memorial being held.

- The word order is slightly different in the machine translation, with ""the"" before ""United Kingdom"" and ""on January 30"" following the memorial, whereas the reference translation has ""in the United Kingdom"" before the date.

- The reference translation includes the word ""celebrated,"" which implies a more festive or recognized event, which is a more accurate representation of a memorial day.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of specificity (mentioning ""celebrated"" instead of ""held""), word order, and the implied celebration of the day. The reference translation better captures the cultural context and meaning of the Nepali source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
|Source: संस्कृत भाषा बाहुनले मात्र पढ्ने भाषा नभएर सबै जातजातिले पढ्ने व्यवस्था समेत भयो।|
|Machine translation: The colloquial language excluded not only the reading language, but all the ethnic languages included the law of reading.|
|Reference translation: Provision was made where Sanskrit was not only a language to be studied by the Brahmins only but also by all ethnicity.|

Analysis:
1. The source text is about Sanskrit being a language that was not limited to reading by a particular group, Brahmins, but also applicable to all ethnicities.
2. In the machine translation, the phrase ""colloquial language"" is incorrect, as it does not match the context of Sanskrit being a specific language. The source text does not mention a colloquial language at all.
3. The machine translation incorrectly states that ""all the ethnic languages included the law of reading,"" which is not the intended meaning. The source text implies that Sanskrit was a language for reading by all, not that it was part of a reading law.
4. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning, stating that ""provision was made"" where Sanskrit was not limited to Brahmins and was meant for all ethnicities.

In conclusion, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of the incorrect interpretation of the colloquial language and the misrepresentation of the relationship between Sanskrit and the reading by all ethnicities. The reference translation better reflects the original source text's intent.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: श्रीस्थान पञ्चकोशी अंतर्गत पर्ने पाँच स्थान मध्यको एक स्थान हो।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Mr. Space is a place among the five places to be under the panchkoshi agency.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Shristhan is one of the place among the five places of panchakoshi.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""श्रीस्थान"" (Shristhan), which is a proper noun referring to a specific place.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""श्रीस्थान"" as ""Mr. Space"", which is a misinterpretation of the name.

- The source text uses ""पञ्चकोशी अंतर्गत"" (under the panchkoshi), while the machine translation says ""under the panchkoshi agency"", which adds an unnecessary agency context.

- The source text says ""पाँच स्थान मध्यको एक स्थान हो"" (one of the five places in the middle), whereas the machine translation omits the ""मध्यको"" (middle) part, making the meaning less clear.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly translates ""श्रीस्थान"" as ""Shristhan"" and keeps the context of ""पञ्चकोशी"" (panchkoshi) without specifying an agency.

- The reference translation also maintains the structure of ""one of the five places"" as ""one of the place among the five places"".

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of proper noun handling, context, and structure. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""श्रीस्थान"" and omits important details from the source text, leading to a less accurate representation of the original meaning.

|im_start|
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: सामान्यरूपले हेर्दा रूपचन्द्रका केही क्रियाकलाप अराजकजस्ता लाग्दछन्।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: While normally held, some activity of the moon is likely to be arranged.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In general, some of Rup Chandra 's activities seem anarchist.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""सामान्यरूपले"" (in general), which is translated as ""While normally held"" in the machine translation. This is a close approximation but not exact.
- ""हेर्दा रूपचन्द्रका"" (Rup Chandra's) is not directly translated, but the context suggests it refers to a specific moon-related entity, which is not captured in the machine translation.
- ""केही क्रियाकलाप"" (some activities) is translated as ""some activity of the moon"" which is accurate but loses the possessive aspect and the connection to Rup Chandra.
- ""अराजकजस्ता"" (anarchist-like) is translated as ""likely to be arranged"" which does not convey the same meaning.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation captures the general nature of the statement and the comparison of Rup Chandra's activities to an anarchist style, which the machine translation does not.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of losing the specific reference to Rup Chandra, the possessive aspect, and the connotation of anarchism. The machine translation is more general and does not fully capture the nuance of the original Nepali text.

|reference_translation| In the year 2031 B.S. , he was given the responsibility of providing security for the coronation ceremony of the late [ [ Birendra Bir Bikram Shah _ King Birendra ] ] .
|comparison|

1. **Time reference**: The machine translation omits the ""B.S."" (Baisakhi Samvat) from the Nepali date, which is a crucial cultural and temporal context. The reference translation includes it, making it clear that the event took place in the Nepali calendar.

2. **Subject identification**: The source mentions ""वीरेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह_राजा वीरेन्द्र"" (Virendra Vir Vikram Shah_Raja Virendra), a specific individual, while the machine translation refers to ""Savior"" without specifying who that is. The reference translation correctly identifies the individual as ""King Birendra"" (Birendra Bir Bikram Shah).

3. **Event description**: The source states that the individual was given the ""जिम्मेवारी"" (responsibility) for the ""सुरक्षा व्यवस्थाको"" (security management) of the ""राज्याभिषेक समारोह"" (coronation ceremony). The machine translation simplifies this to ""security management of the royal society,"" which loses the specific context of the coronation.

4. **Omission of honorific and title**: The source includes the honorific ""राजा"" (King) in the name, but the machine translation does not. The reference translation includes it, maintaining the proper formality.

In summary, the machine translation loses important cultural and contextual details, as well as the specific reference to the individual involved. The reference translation provides a more accurate and faithful representation of the source text.

|Reference translation: Therefore, Ganesha's Gajavadan was received, but Hanuman's importance increased in the medieval tradition.|

|Analysis|
1. **""तसर्थ""**: The source text uses ""तसर्थ"" which means ""therefore"" or ""thus"" in Nepali. The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""In fact"", which is not an exact equivalent.
2. **""गणेशजीको गजवदन""**: The source refers to ""Ganesha's Gajavadan,"" a term specific to the deity Ganesha and his ritual. The machine translation omits the possessive ""जीको"" and translates it as ""meshazi's gaze,"" which is a misunderstanding.
3. **""प्राप्त भयो""**: The source means ""was received"" or ""obtained"" in the context of the ritual. The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""increased,"" which is not accurate.
4. **""हनुमानको महीव""**: The source refers to the importance of Hanuman. The machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""the honeymoon of hunan,"" which is a literal and unrelated interpretation.
5. **""वृद्धि भयो""**: The source means ""increase in importance"" or ""growth in significance."" The machine translation again translates it as ""increased,"" which is not the best choice.

Machine translation: W Bush met and offered them about the libyans entering the third world.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: He met with W. Bush and proposed that the Libyans enter the Third World.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the source text, ""डब्लु बुशलाई भेटेर"" (W. Bush met) is a direct translation, but the machine translation omits the honorific ""W."" and adds ""them"" which is not present in the source.
- ""ती लिब्यनहरु"" (the Libyans) is translated as ""the libyans"" in the machine translation, but it should be ""the Libyans"" with capitalization as in the reference.
- ""तेस्रो संसार"" (the third world) is translated correctly, but the machine translation places ""entering"" before it, while in the reference, it is after ""proposed.""
- ""प्रवेश गर्न लागेको"" (had to enter) is translated as ""entering"" in the machine translation, which is a simplification and loses the nuance of necessity.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of honorific, capitalization, and the structure of the sentence. The reference translation more accurately captures the meaning and form of the original Nepali text.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Red , green , yellow and blue colors are especially used in Holi .

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""होलीमा"" (Holi specifically) and ""रातो"" (especially at night), which are not present in the machine translation. The machine translation incorrectly assumes ""holly"" refers to a species, whereas it is a festival in Nepal.
- The machine translation omits the context of ""रातो"" (night) and the list of colors ""हरियो, पहेँलो, नीलो"" (Red, green, yellow, and blue).
- The machine translation uses ""colours more commonly used"" instead of ""बढी प्रयोग हुन्छ"" (are more commonly used) in the source text, which loses the nuance of frequency.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation does not capture the correct context of Holi festival and the emphasis on the colors being used during the event.

|Reference translation: Although the traditional rules of Maruni dance are often the same , the rhythm and language of the songs used in the dance vary according to location and community.|
|Analysis:|
1. **""मारुनी नाचको परम्परागत नियमहरूमा प्रायः एक रुपता पाइए""** - Machine: ""one of the rules is often found in the traditional rules of maruni dance"" - Reference: ""the traditional rules of Maruni dance are often the same""
   Difference: The machine translation incorrectly implies that only one rule is common, while the reference states that the rules themselves are generally the same.

2. **""नाचमा प्रयोगहुने गितहरूको लय""** - Machine: ""the lyrics of the songs used in the dance"" - Reference: ""the rhythm and language of the songs used in the dance""
   Difference: The machine translation omits ""rhythm"" from the reference, focusing only on language.

3. **""भाषामा स्थान र समुदाय अनुसार फरक फरक रहेको छ""** - Machine: ""differed according to the location and community"" - Reference: ""vary according to location and community""
   Difference: The machine translation uses ""differed,"" which suggests a difference in the songs' characteristics, while the reference uses ""vary,"" which implies a range of possibilities rather than a clear difference.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in the representation of the rules being the same, the inclusion of rhythm in the description of song elements, and the choice of words to convey the variation, which affects the overall meaning and nuance of the sentence.

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""मानवशास्त्री"" (anthropologists) and ""इतिहासविद्हरूका"" (history), which are specific fields of study. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""मानवशास्त्री"" as ""humanists"" and ""इतिहासविद्हरूका"" as ""history"", which are not the same. Anthropologists study human biology, behavior, and culture, while humanists focus on the humanities.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""चलायमान"" (moving) as ""nation"", which is a geopolitical term and does not convey the same meaning as the original text, which refers to the mobility or dynamic nature of humans.

|Machine translation: Inside the house, the cure serpent is towed to a man who is deprived of his saviour when he runs his hands or hurts the serpent.|
|Reference translation: A snake bites a sleeping person when he moves his legs for safety.|

Analysis:
1. The source text describes a situation where a person (who is possibly the owner or caretaker) is handling a snake inside the house, either to save it or to prevent it from harming someone.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""घरभित्र पसेको करेँत"" (Inside the house, the cure serpent is doing) as ""the cure serpent is towed to a man"", suggesting an action of towing, which is not present in the source. The correct interpretation is that the person is handling the snake.
3. The machine translation also adds the idea of the man being ""deprived of his saviour"" and ""hurting the serpent"" which are not mentioned in the source. The source only implies that the person is moving the snake for safety or to prevent a bite.
4. The reference translation accurately captures the action of the snake biting a person who is moving their legs in a sleeping state for safety.

Overall, the machine translation deviates from the source by introducing unnecessary elements (towing, saviour, hurting the serpent) and losing the context of handling the snake for safety. The reference translation is a more faithful representation of the original Nepali text.

- The reference translation uses ""to introduce"" which better captures the intention of presenting the definitions to understand the epic's relation to the ideas.

Step 5: Conclusion

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""तिल"" (til) and ""चिउराको"" (chiura), which are specific ingredients or items used in the festival.
2. The machine translation correctly identifies ""til"" as ""til"" but translates ""चिउराको"" as ""chiura,"" which might be a mistranslation or a less common term in English. It's possible that ""chiura"" refers to a specific type of beaten rice, but without context, it's not clear.

|Reference translation: But people of the recently spread Pranami community have been worshiping their own religious gurus, including Lord Krishna and Mangaldasji Maharaj.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""प्रणामी धर्म सम्प्रदायका मानिसहरू"" (people of the Pranami religious community), which refers to a specific community, not ""systematic patriarchs"" as in the machine translation. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as a group of patriarchs.
2. The machine translation mentions ""goddess mercury"" (मेर्कुरी), which is not present in the source or reference translations. This is likely a mistranslation or an error.
3. The machine translation omits ""भगवान कृष्ण"" (Lord Krishna) from the list of religious gurus, while the reference translation includes it. This is a significant difference, as Lord Krishna is a central figure in Nepali culture and religion.
4. The reference translation correctly includes ""मंगलदासजी महाराज"" (Mangaldasji Maharaj), which is present in the source text, while the machine translation omits it.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: तोरणको  दुर्ग पूनाका दक्षिण पश्चिममा  ३० किलोमीटरको दूरीमा थियो
- Machine translation: The Durg of toru was 30 km to the southwest of puna

Step 2: Identify differences in translation.
- In the source text, ""तोरणको"" refers to ""of Toran"" (the possessive form in Nepali), but the machine translation incorrectly uses ""toru"" as if it's a separate location.
- ""दुर्ग"" is translated as ""Durg"" in both, but the possessive form in the source is not maintained in the machine translation.
- ""पूनाका"" is translated as ""of puna"" in the machine translation, but it should be ""Puna"" without the possessive marker.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Reference translation: The fort of Toran was 30 kilometers southwest of Puna.

Step 4: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation has the correct translation for ""दुर्ग"" as ""fort"" but loses the possessive connection with ""तोरणको"" in the source.
- The reference translation correctly uses ""The fort of Toran"" instead of ""The Durg of toru"" and omits the possessive marker ""पूनाका"" as it's not needed in English.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of maintaining the possessive connection and structure. The correct translation should be: ""The fort of Toran was 30 kilometers southwest of Puna.""

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
Source: सबै ग्रह सप्तमस्थानदेखि प्रथमस्थानसम्म रही शुभफलदायक छत्रयोग बनाएमा

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Submerged from planet sufficient space to first space and if guided.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: If all the planets from the seventh place to the first place make auspicious Chhatra Yoga

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation seems to have mistranslated or misunderstood the source text. It mentions ""submerged"" and ""sufficient space"" which are not present in the source.
- The source talks about planets being in specific positions (from the seventh to the first place) and the formation of a auspicious Chhatra Yoga, while the machine translation suggests a condition of being guided, which is not directly related to the original context.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation omits the concept of planets being in specific positions ( सप्तमस्थानदेखि प्रथमस्थानसम्म) and instead introduces the idea of being submerged and guided, which is not accurate.
- The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of the source, focusing on the formation of auspicious Chhatra Yoga due to the positions of the planets.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of meaning and context. It would be necessary to correct the translation to accurately convey the original Nepali text, which discusses the formation of an auspicious astrological configuration (Chhatra Yoga) based on the positions of planets.

|Machine translation: Here the convict sent a contestant named keriyar to daman.|
|Reference translation: Here Convention sent individual named Keriyer for opression.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject**: In the source, the subject is ""कन्भेन्सनले"" (Convention), but the machine translation incorrectly identifies it as ""the convict"". The reference translation correctly uses ""Convention"" as the subject.
2. **Action**: The source states that ""पठायो"" (read) is done for a purpose, which is ""दमनको लागि"" (for the purpose of oppression/detention). The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""sent a contestant to daman"", which implies a different action and destination.
3. **Object**: The source mentions ""केरियार"" (Keriyar) as the individual being acted upon, while the machine translation refers to them as a ""contestant"". The reference translation correctly uses ""individual named Keriyer.""
4. **Purpose**: The machine translation omits the context of ""दमनको लागि"" (for the purpose of oppression), which is crucial to understanding the action.

|Source: तर हनुमानले बेलैमा गएर नरकान्तलाई मारेर राम लक्ष्मणलाई फिर्ता ल्याए।|
|Machine translation: But Hanuman went to the bail, and killed Norca, and brought back ram lakshmi.|
|Reference translation: But Hanuman killed Narakanta in time and brought back Rama Laxman.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""बेलैमा"" (bail), which is a reference to a specific location or event, not a person's name. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Norca,"" which is a completely different entity.
2. The source text says ""मारेर"" (killed), which is in the context of the action performed by Hanuman. The machine translation omits this aspect, making it unclear that Hanuman killed someone.
3. The machine translation incorrectly combines ""Rama"" and ""Lakshman"" into ""ram lakshmi,"" which is not a proper noun but a concatenation of two names. The reference translation correctly separates them as ""Rama Laxman.""

In conclusion, the machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the interpretation of ""बेलैमा"" as a person's name, the omission of the action ""मारेर,"" and the incorrect combination of ""Rama"" and ""Lakshman."" The quality of the translation is poor due to these inaccuracies.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: प्रत्येक हप्ता आइतबार बिहान प्रत्यक्ष प्रशारण हुने उक्त कार्यक्रम सरकारद्वारा सञ्चालित रेडियोमा  प्रशारण हुन्थ्यो ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Each weekday morning was a question on the radio operated by the government that would be a direct question on Sunday.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The program , which was broadcasted live every Sunday morning , was broadcasted on government-run radio.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""प्रत्येक हप्ता आइतबार"" (every weekday morning), while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Each weekday morning.""
- The source text talks about ""बिहान प्रत्यक्ष प्रशारण"" (direct broadcast on Sunday), but the machine translation incorrectly interprets this as ""a question on the radio on Sunday.""
- The source text uses ""सरकारद्वारा सञ्चालित"" (organized by the government), which is not directly translated in the machine translation.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of ""प्रत्येक हप्ता आइतबार"" as ""every Sunday morning.""
- The reference translation conveys the idea of ""बिहान प्रत्यक्ष प्रशारण"" as ""broadcasted live.""
- The reference translation includes ""सरकारद्वारा सञ्चालित"" as ""government-run.""

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the event description (incorrectly interpreting the weekday and Sunday events) and the organization aspect (not mentioning that the program is government-run). The reference translation provides a more accurate and faithful representation of the source text.

|Machine translation: Besszi was called to write mathematics after composing 18 psychological plays.|
|Reference translation: After composing 18 Parwa of Mahabharat, Vyasji had called Ganesji to write.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text is about Vyas (व्यासजी) and his association with Ganesha (गणेशजी) in the context of writing, specifically after completing 18 parts (पर्व) of the Mahabharat.
2. The machine translation incorrectly identifies Vyas as ""Besszi"" and the subject matter as ""mathematics"" instead of the original context, which is the completion of 18 Parvas of the epic.
3. The reference translation correctly translates ""व्यासजी"" as ""Vyasji"" and maintains the context of writing, mentioning ""Ganesji"" and ""18 Parwa of Mahabharat.""
4. The machine translation also omits the verb ""लागी बोलाएका थिए"" (called to write) from the source, which is crucial for understanding the action.

1. ""प्राक्कल्पना"" (hypothesis) vs ""an alien"" - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""प्राक्कल्पना"" as ""an alien,"" which is a literal translation that doesn't fit the context of research. The reference translation uses ""hypothesis"" as a more appropriate term for the research context.
2. ""निर्माण"" (construction) vs ""making"" - The machine translation uses ""constructing an alternative,"" which is not directly translated from ""निर्माण"" but implies a broader concept. The reference translation uses ""making a hypothesis,"" which is a more accurate translation of the original Nepali term.
3. ""नगरिकन शोध कार्य"" (research work) vs ""proceeding"" - The machine translation translates ""नगरिकन शोध कार्य"" as ""proceeding,"" which is not an exact match. The reference translation keeps it as ""research work,"" which is more precise.

Overall, the machine translation deviates from the reference translation in terms of the specific term ""hypothesis"" and the context of the research work, while the translation of ""निर्माण"" and ""नगरिकन शोध कार्य"" is less accurate.

|Reference translation: Folk songs are bound by rhythm. In other words, there is a connection like that of nails and flesh between songs and rhythm.|

Analysis:
1. The source text discusses the connection between folk songs and their rhythm, using the metaphor of ""nails and flesh.""
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""लयले बाँधेको"" (bounded by lyrics) as ""bounded by lyrics"" and omits the metaphor, which is crucial for understanding the intended meaning.
3. The machine translation also introduces the unrelated concepts of ""nong"" (a term that doesn't appear in the source, possibly a typo or a misunderstanding) and ""meat,"" which are not present in the source or the reference translation.
4. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning by translating ""लयमा नङ र मासुको सम्बन्ध"" as ""like that of nails and flesh"" and maintaining the focus on rhythm.

|im_start|>

Step 1: Understand the source text
The source text in Nepali says, ""यी चार थरी मध्ये एकको घरमा जुठो सुतक भए पूजिदैनन ।"" This sentence can be translated to English as, ""If there is a Jutho Sutak in the house of one of these four people, no worship is done.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation provided is, ""The house of one of the four sorcerers is not lying."" This sentence does not directly convey the same meaning as the source text. It suggests that the house of a sorcerer is not in a deceptive state, whereas the source text is about the absence of worship if Jutho Sutak is present.

Step 3: Compare the reference translation
The reference translation is, ""If one of these four surnames has Jutho Sutak in the house, no worshipping is done."" This translation accurately captures the condition and the absence of worship as stated in the source text.

Step 4: Identify differences
The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the focus on the absence of worship (पूजिदैनन) in the source text, which is not clearly conveyed in the machine translation. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""जुठो सुतक"" (Jutho Sutak) as ""lying"" (which doesn't make sense in this context), while the reference translation correctly translates it as a condition for no worship.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of high quality because it misinterprets the meaning of ""Jutho Sutak"" and does not convey the condition about the absence of worship accurately. The reference translation is a more faithful representation of the source text.

|Reference translation: For that Gautam himself requested Ram to turn his wife 's stone structure to human structure by meeting him|

Analysis:

- The machine translation has ""the scarlet gecko"" which is not directly translated from ""धावक गेच्छिञ्जाकस्य"" (which refers to a specific type of gecko, possibly associated with running or agility). The reference translation uses ""Runner Gechchhinjakasya"" which is a more accurate interpretation of the term.
- The machine translation has ""records of the hadig of partridge"" while the source text refers to ""हाडिगाउँको अभिलेखमा"" (inscription of Hadigaun). The reference translation correctly keeps the context of Hadigaun, a place, not a partridge.
- The punctuation is different in the machine translation, with a comma instead of a dash or a pause (as in the reference translation).

2. **Village names**: The machine translation mentions ""villages like shock,"" which is not accurate. The reference translation specifies ""Chharchhare"" and ""Dhande,"" which are actual Nepali village names.
3. **Threat description**: The machine translation refers to ""floodlit trail,"" which is not a threat but a possible effect of the situation. The reference translation correctly describes the threat as ""flood and landslide.""
4. **Timeframe**: The reference translation specifies ""June and July,"" while the machine translation does not provide this context.

2. **""सरकारले""** (the government) - Present in both translations.
3. **""उनका अनुयायीहरूलाई""** (his followers) - Machine translation uses ""absorbed by gandhiji"", which is not accurate. Reference translation uses ""kept away from his followers"".

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In the temple of the goddess, a dozens of bananas must be offered.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""भगवान् विष्णुको मन्दिरमा"" (the temple of Lord Vishnu), while the machine translation refers to ""the temple of the goddess"" which is a generalization and might not be specific to Lord Vishnu.
- The source text uses ""एक दर्जनको सङ्ख्यामा केरा"" (a number of kera), which refers to a Nepali fruit similar to a banana. The machine translation translates this as ""a number of keras"" which is likely a mistranslation, as ""keras"" is not a common English word for a fruit.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly translates ""केरा"" as ""bananas"" in English.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in two main aspects:
1. It generalizes the deity to ""the goddess"" instead of specifying Lord Vishnu.
2. It mistranslates ""केरा"" as ""keras"" when it should be translated as ""bananas.""

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: यस प्रकार दिनमा कम्तिमा १५ मिनेट खर्च गर भन्ने उनको भनाइ थियो।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: This was his disappointment that he would spend at least 15 minutes on the day.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: He asked to spend at least 15 minutes a day in this way.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation suggests that there is a disappointment involved, which is not explicitly stated in the source text.
- The machine translation uses ""This was his disappointment"" which implies a past event, while the source text is a statement about a request or action (भनाइ थियो, which means ""I asked"").
- The reference translation directly translates the request for spending 15 minutes a day in the given manner, which is more accurate.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- The machine translation adds an unnecessary emotional context (disappointment) that is not present in the source.
- The machine translation's structure implies a past event, while the reference keeps it in the present tense.
- The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text by focusing on the request.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of adding an emotional context and changing the tense, which results in a less accurate representation of the source text. The reference translation is a more faithful translation of the original Nepali sentence.

- सुरा, सुन्दरी, सान्सारिक सुखभोग (sura, beauty, sansaric happiness)
- बाधक (hindrance, obstacle)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""For the sums, the beauty, and the sansaric happiness.""
- Reference translation: ""Material happiness, beauty, and sura are hurdles to Yogis.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation has ""sums"" instead of ""sura"" (which refers to a heavenly realm in Hinduism), which is a significant difference in meaning.
- The machine translation uses ""the"" before ""beauty"" and ""sansaric happiness,"" which are not present in the source text, altering the structure and meaning.
- The reference translation correctly translates ""बाधक"" as ""hindrances"" or ""obstacles,"" while the machine translation does not provide this context.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, cultural context (sura), and the structure of the sentence. The reference translation better captures the meaning and nuances of the original Nepali text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
Step 1: Read the source text
The source text is: विश्व रेस्लिङ फेड्रेसन/इन्टरटेन्मेंट/डब्ल्यूडब्ल्यूई

Step 2: Read the machine translation
The machine translation is: World Reisling Fedration / Intervention / WWE

Step 3: Read the reference translation
The reference translation is: World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment / WWE

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation has ""World Reisling Fedration"" which is incorrect. The correct term should be ""World Wrestling Federation"" as per the source text.
- The machine translation has ""Intervention"" which is not present in the source text. The correct division in the source is ""इन्टरटेन्मेंट"" which means ""Entertainment"" in English.
- The machine translation has ""WWE"" at the end, which is the same as the reference translation.

Step 5: Identify the differences
- Difference 1: Incorrect term ""World Reisling Fedration"" should be ""World Wrestling Federation"".
- Difference 2: Missing or incorrect division ""Intervention"" should be replaced with ""Entertainment"".

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the correct name of the organization (World Reisling Fedration vs World Wrestling Federation) and the division (Intervention vs Entertainment). The only similarity is the acronym ""WWE"" at the end, which is correct.

|Source: कतिपय नेपाली समुदायहरूमा महिलाको आफ्नो जात गोत्र हुँदैन, उसलाई केवल पुरुषको जात र गोत्रलाई अघि सार्ने साधनको रूपमा हेरिन्छ।|
|Machine translation: In some of the nepali communities, women don't have their own goats, seeing him as just a man's goat and as a career to move before the goat.|
|Reference translation: In some Nepali communities , women do not have their own caste or tribe , they are seen only as a means to advance the caste and tribe of men .|

|Analysis|
1. **Caste/ Tribe vs. Goats**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""जात गोत्र"" (caste/tribe) as ""own goats"" (पुरुषको जात र गोत्रलाई अघि सार्ने साधनको रूपमा हेरिन्छ), which is a misinterpretation. The reference translation correctly identifies the lack of their own caste or tribe.
2. **Women's role**: The machine translation suggests that women are seen as a ""career to move before the goat,"" which is a metaphorical and awkward phrasing. The reference translation more accurately conveys that women are seen as a means to advance the men's caste and tribe.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: There is a woreda of the mallow family with a number of hundreds in the construction.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: There is a habitation of the Malla family with a number of hundreds in the Pachnaali .

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""पचनालीमा"" (in Pachnaali), which refers to a location.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates this to ""with a number of hundreds in the construction,"" which does not convey the location.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The source text talks about ""एक सयको संख्यामा मल्ल परिवारको वसोवास"" (a habitation of the Malla family with a number of hundreds), which is a clear description of a family settlement.
- The reference translation accurately captures this by saying ""a habitation of the Malla family with a number of hundreds in the Pachnaali.""

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it incorrectly translates the location ""पचनालीमा"" as ""in the construction"" and misses the context of a family habitation. The reference translation, on the other hand, accurately conveys the meaning of the source text by specifying the location and the type of settlement.

Machine translation: Among these subspecies, the order of the church patriarchal studies of the discipline

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: In the course of article-wise study of sophistication within the subset

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""परिष्कारवादको चर्चा"" (church discussions on refinement) and ""अध्ययनका क्रममा"" (the order of studies).
- The machine translation translates ""परिष्कारवादको चर्चा"" as ""the order of the church patriarchal studies"" which is a direct translation but loses the context of refinement discussions.
- It also translates ""अध्ययनका क्रममा"" as ""the order of the discipline,"" which is not an accurate representation of the original meaning, which refers to the sequence or arrangement of studies.

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text by translating ""परिष्कारवादको चर्चा"" as ""article-wise study of sophistication"" and ""अध्ययनका क्रममा"" as ""in the course of,"" which indicates the progression or arrangement of studies.

Step 6: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in that it loses the context of refinement discussions and does not accurately convey the meaning of ""अध्ययनका क्रममा"" as the sequence or arrangement of studies.

|Machine translation: Even the suburb of kassir community went on to become Kashmir in the kassir arts.|
|Reference translation: Similarly, Kassir, a colony of the Kass community, eventually became Kashmir.|

Analysis:
1. The source text refers to ""कस्स समुदायको उपनिवेश"" (suburb of the Kass community), which is translated as ""the suburb of kassir community"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly uses ""Kassir, a colony of the Kass community,"" which is a more accurate representation of the source.
2. The machine translation adds ""in the kassir arts,"" which is not present in the source text. This is an unnecessary addition and does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
3. The structure of the sentence is slightly different in the machine translation, with ""went on to become"" instead of ""became"" in the reference translation. This change affects the flow and simplicity of the sentence.

|Reference translation: Although the movie 'third atonement' which was screened at the Toronto movie festival couldn't do well, kuniz gathered some praise.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""देखाइएको"" (seen), which is translated as ""shown"" in the reference translation, but the machine translation omits this context, making it unclear that the 'third atonement' was a movie that was screened.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""पनि खासै"" (especially) as ""good enough"", which doesn't convey the intended emphasis on the film's lack of quality. The reference translation uses ""couldn't do well"" to express the same idea.
3. The machine translation omits the word ""ले"" (which) after ""देखाइएको"", which is important for connecting the phrase to the following clause. This results in a less clear sentence structure.

Overall, the machine translation loses some context and nuance, and the sentence structure is not as clear as the reference translation. The main differences lie in the handling of the movie screening context and the emphasis on the film's quality.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: He closed that in running the Indian Rupee Nepalese note as well.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: He stopped the use of Indian rupee that was circulating like a Nepali note.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- In the source text, ""नेपाली नोट सरह चलिरहेकामा"" (Indian rupee notes being circulated) is not directly translated as ""in running the Indian Rupee Nepalese note"" in the machine translation. The phrase suggests that the Indian rupees were being used in a way similar to Nepalese notes, while the machine translation might imply that the circulation was an ongoing process.
- The machine translation uses ""closed that"" which could be interpreted as stopping something in general, whereas the reference translation specifically states ""stopped the use of"" to clarify the action.
- The reference translation also adds the detail that the Indian rupees were ""circulating like a Nepali note,"" which is not explicitly mentioned in the machine translation.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the phrase ""नेपाली नोट सरह चलिरहेकामा,"" which affects the understanding of the context. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate translation by specifying the circulation and the action of stopping its use.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Parashuram , promised his mother to destroyed the Chhetris as many times as .

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the source text
- The machine translation has a different structure: ""And it came to pass"" is a phrase that doesn't directly correspond to the Nepali sentence. The source text uses ""त्यति पटक"" (at that time) which is not translated accurately.
- The verb ""विनास गर्ने"" (to destroy) is translated as ""the tradition of destruction"" in the machine translation, which loses the action aspect.
- The subject ""परशुरामले"" (by Parashuram) is not clearly expressed in the machine translation.
- The phrase ""आफ्नी मातालाई बचन दिए"" (promised his mother to save) is translated as ""was delivered unto his mother"" which changes the meaning.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation omits the repetition of ""destroyed"" in the reference translation, which is a key part of the story.
- The reference translation specifies the target of the destruction (the Chhetris), which is not included in the machine translation.

|Reference translation: Kuniz 's family is Jewish , and according to them , according to him , non-jewish sentiment became the cause of leaving the Soviet Union.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text starts with ""कुनिजको परिवार यहुदी हुन्"" (Kuniz's family is Jewish), which is correctly translated as ""Kuniz's family is Jewish"" in both the machine and reference translations.
2. The phrase ""उनकै अनुसार"" (according to them) is missing in the machine translation. It should be included to clarify whose perspective is being referred to, as it is crucial for understanding the context.
3. The machine translation adds ""his family also became the cause"" which is not present in the source text. The reference translation omits this part, which might be an attempt to simplify the sentence without losing the main point.
4. The machine translation incorrectly adds ""because of the harsh opposition of non-Jewish opponents"" with the word ""harsh"" (घास) not present in the source. The reference translation omits this detail, focusing on ""non-Jewish sentiment"" instead, which is a more accurate representation of the source.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of clarity about whose perspective is being referred to and the addition of unnecessary details (harsh opposition).

Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिकामा (United States)
- Machine translation: The United States
- Difference: The machine translation omits the word ""लगभग"" (approximately) which is important to convey the estimated number.

Step 2: Compare the source text with the reference translation.
- Source: लगभग वयस्क जनसङ्ख्याको (approximately adult population)
- Machine translation: the logging population
- Reference translation: the logging population

|Reference translation: The rate of damage of lung 's capacity of a person is high in peiple who are in more rush .|

Analysis:
1. The source text is about the relationship between increased intensity and the decline in a person's lung capacity, not about the rate of foxes.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""तीव्रताहरू"" (increased intensity) as ""more intelligence"" and ""फोक्सोको क्षमता"" (lung capacity) as ""foxes,"" which is a literal mistranslation.
3. The reference translation correctly translates ""तीव्रताहरू"" as ""in more rush"" (implying increased intensity) and ""फोक्सोको क्षमता"" as ""lung's capacity.""
4. The machine translation also incorrectly states that the rate is ""quickly worse,"" while the reference translation mentions ""high"" without specifying the speed.

|Machine translation: This means hailing places that present a painting of its expected cold environment.|
|Reference translation: This means a place of hailstorm that depicts a picture of its expected cold environment.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference in meaning**: The machine translation omits the word ""भयो"" (hailstorm), which is crucial to convey the context of the source sentence. The reference translation includes it, making the meaning clear that it refers to a specific location where hail occurs.

2. **Word order and structure**: The machine translation has a slightly different word order, placing ""hailing places"" before ""present a painting,"" which might not be as natural in English as the reference translation, which places ""that depicts a picture"" after ""a place of hailstorm.""

3. **Translation of ""चिसो""**: The machine translation translates ""चिसो"" as ""painting,"" while the reference translation uses ""depicts a picture."" The latter is more accurate, as it implies the act of representing a picture rather than just a painting.

4. **Overall coherence**: The reference translation maintains the coherence and context of the source sentence better than the machine translation, especially by including ""भयो"" and using the correct verb ""depicts"" to describe the relationship between the place and its expected cold environment.

3. **Reference translation**: On the last day of Maghe Sankranti, i.e. the last day of Poush, it is customary to slaughter pigs at home, which is called 'Jita Marana Din'.

- **Difference 1**: The machine translation uses ""demolition"" and ""push"" instead of specifying the context as ""Maghe Sankranti"" and ""Poush"" (Nepali month names). This is a significant loss of meaning and cultural context.
- **Difference 2**: The machine translation refers to ""cutting the pig into the house"" instead of the more accurate ""slaughtering pigs at home"" in the reference translation. This changes the action and implies a different scenario.

|Reference translation: While the strength of man is limited, the proper use of his thoughts opens up the potential for the business to proceed in many ways.|
|Analysis:|
1. **""सिमित हुदाहुदै""** (limited) - Machine translation: ""limited"", Reference translation: ""limited"". Both translations are accurate.
2. **""उसका सोचको उचित उपयोगले""** (the proper use of his thoughts) - Machine translation: ""the proper use of his thoughts"", Reference translation: ""the proper use of his thoughts"". Both translations are the same.
3. **""अघि बढ्नका लागि""** (to proceed) - Machine translation: ""to proceed"", Reference translation: ""to proceed"". Both translations convey the same meaning.
4. **""असंख्य सम्भावनाहरु""** (innumerable possibilities) - Machine translation: ""the potential for the business to proceed"", Reference translation: ""in many ways"". The machine translation omits the ""innumerable"" aspect and instead uses ""the potential for the business to proceed"", which is less specific than the reference translation.

|Reference translation: Among Chhetri, people of Paudel, Thapa, Rai, Khadka, Pande, Bhandari surname live here.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""क्षेत्रीमा"" (local), which is not translated accurately in the machine translation. It is translated as ""the people of the area"" but misses the context of being local or belonging to a specific community.
2. ""थरका मानिसहरू"" (people with the Tharaka surname) is translated as ""stewardess of the wearer"" in the machine translation, which is a significant error. The Tharaka is a surname, not a profession related to a wearer.
3. The reference translation correctly identifies ""Chhetri"" as a community, which is not present in the machine translation.

|machine_translation| On 1 October 2007, Britney filed a lawsuit with federalin to harass the citizenship of her children.|
|reference_translation| On 1 October 2007 , Britney lost lawsuit against Federlin regarding physical custody of her children.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""ब्रिट्नीले फेडरलिन सँग"" (Britney against Federlin), which refers to a legal action taken by Britney against Federlin. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""filed a lawsuit with federalin"" to harass the citizenship, which is a misinterpretation of the context.
2. The source states that the issue was related to ""शारीरिक संरक्षकत्व"" (physical custody), which is not mentioned in the machine translation. Instead, it suggests a harassment of citizenship, which is unrelated to the context of a custody battle.
3. The machine translation incorrectly states that Britney ""harassed the citizenship of her children,"" which is a misrepresentation of the event. The reference translation correctly states that Britney ""lost the lawsuit"" regarding physical custody.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of the legal action (misinterpreting it as harassment of citizenship instead of a custody battle) and the nature of the issue (omitting the mention of physical custody).

|Machine translation: Although madrid exited the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo won in the copa del Rey's final, becoming the first professional in Spain to win.|
|Reference translation: Although Madrid were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League semi-finals , Ronaldo scored the winning goal in the Copa del Rey final to win his first title in Spain.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Difference 1**: The machine translation uses ""bāhiriye"" (बाहिरिए), which means ""outside"" or ""exited"", while the reference translation uses ""knocked out"" (बाहिर निकालिए), which is a more accurate and idiomatic way to convey the idea of being eliminated from the competition.
2. **Difference 2**: The machine translation states that Ronaldo ""won in the copa del Rey's final"" and ""became the first professional in Spain to win,"" implying that he won a general professional title. The reference translation clarifies that he ""scored the winning goal"" and ""won his first title in Spain,"" specifying that it was a specific match (Copa del Rey) and not a general professional title.
3. **Difference 3**: The reference translation includes the phrase ""semi-finals"" (सेमिफाइनल) in Nepali, which is not present in the machine translation. This is important context for understanding the event.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the more precise elimination context, the distinction between winning a match and a general professional title, and the inclusion of the specific competition stage (semi-finals). The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

|Reference translation: Chavez won the December 2006 presidential election with 63 % of the vote.|

Analysis:
1. The source text is in Nepali, and the machine translation is in English.
2. The machine translation adds the word ""re-"" before ""won,"" which is not present in the original Nepali text. This implies a possible mistranslation or an attempt to convey the idea of a repeat victory.
3. The machine translation uses ""receiving 63% of the vote"" as a separate clause, while the reference translation combines it with the main clause using ""with 63% of the vote."" This makes the reference translation more concise and grammatically accurate.
4. The date format is different: ""डिसेम्बरमा"" (December) is translated as ""December 2006"" in the reference translation, which is more standard in English.

Overall, the machine translation is not entirely accurate in terms of word choice and structure, while the reference translation better captures the meaning and is more grammatically consistent with the English language.

|Reference translation: Sharma , Mohan Raj , Contemporary Criticism : Theory and Practice , Kathmandu : Nepal Rajkiya Pragya Pratisthan , 2055.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Keyword mismatch**: The machine translation uses ""contemporary theology"" instead of ""समकालीन समालोचना"" (contemporary criticism) from the source. This is a significant difference as it changes the subject matter of the text.

2. **Missing punctuation**: The source text includes the colon (:) after ""समकालीन समालोचना"" to indicate a title or subject, which is missing in the machine translation.

3. **Institution name**: The machine translation refers to ""Nepal political administration"" instead of ""नेपाल राजकीय प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठान"" (Nepal Political Wisdom Institution), which is the correct name of the organization in the source.

4. **Year**: The machine translation omits the year ""२०५५"" from the source, which is crucial for dating the publication.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in subject matter, punctuation, institution name, and the absence of the publication year, which affect the quality and accuracy of the translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the original source text.

|Reference translation: In the Shatrudra Samhita, Hanuman is considered to be the eleventh incarnation among ekadash rudra.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to ""शतरुद्र संहितामा"" (Shatrudra Samhita), a specific text, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""akkadian rudras,"" which is a reference to a different cultural context (Akkadian is an ancient Semitic language, not related to Shatrudra Samhita).
2. The machine translation omits the word ""मध्ये"" (among), which is crucial to convey the idea that Hanuman is one among many incarnations.
3. The machine translation uses ""the eleventh of"" instead of ""the eleventh incarnation,"" which is a more accurate term to describe Hanuman's position in the context of Rudras.

|Reference translation: Governmental sacrifices were given on the day of Nawami of Dashain in the past in the Sukati village located in Upper Bogtan.|

Analysis:

1. **Time reference**: The machine translation does not mention the ""in the past"" time context, which is present in the reference translation. It implies a hypothetical scenario, while the reference clearly states a historical event.

2. **Event description**: The machine translation suggests that ""lower wogatan intervened"" and the village would have been governed by nobles of wadada, which is a rephrasing that loses the original meaning. The source text talks about ""sukāti gāunma"" (Sukati village) receiving ""sarkāri vali"" (governmental sacrifices) on a specific day.

3. **Location**: The machine translation omits the ""Upper Bogtan"" part, which is crucial for specifying the location. The reference translation includes this detail.

4. **Sentence structure**: The machine translation has a more complex structure, which might lead to confusion, while the reference translation is clearer and more faithful to the original.

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of time context, event description, location, and sentence structure, resulting in a less accurate representation of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: जसको प्रमाण यहाँका रूखहरूमा पाइने एक किसिमको प्राकृतिक छापलाई लिन सकिन्छ।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The evidence of which can be taken of a kind of natural sketch found in the trees here.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: The evidence of which can be taken of a kind of natural sketch found in the trees here.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Both translations convey the same meaning: that there is evidence of a certain type of natural sketch that can be found in the trees in the given location.
- The structure and word order are similar in both translations: ""The evidence of which"" is the subject, ""can be taken"" is the main verb, and ""of a kind of natural sketch found in the trees here"" is the descriptive phrase.

Step 5: Identify any differences
- The only difference is the presence of the word ""लिन सकिन्छ"" in the source text, which is a Nepali verb indicating the possibility or ability to find. In the machine translation, this is not directly translated, but the meaning is implied through the phrase ""found in the trees here.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is accurate in capturing the essence of the source text, but it omits the verb indicating the possibility of finding (लिन सकिन्छ). The reference translation, while identical in structure, omits this detail as well. Overall, the quality of the translation is good, but the inclusion of the verb would make it more faithful to the original Nepali text.

|Reference translation: A big fair is held on the day of Janai Purnima in this pond which is considered very important from religious point of view.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text refers to a ""पोखरीमा"" (pond) and a ""जनै पूर्णिमाको दिन"" (day of Janai Purnima), which is a specific religious festival.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""पोखरीमा"" as ""pool"" and omits the mention of ""Janai Purnima.""
3. The machine translation describes the event as a ""great melody,"" which is a metaphorical interpretation that is not present in the source or reference text.
4. The reference translation correctly translates the religious significance and mentions a ""big fair"" being held on that day.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation by misinterpreting the context, omitting the festival name, and introducing a metaphor that is not supported by the source text.

|Source: अश्विनी नक्षत्रको अर्थ अश्वपुरुष र देवता अश्विनीकुमार हुन्।|
|Machine translation: Ashwini Nakshatri means astrologer and goddess of astrology.|
|Reference translation: Ashwini Nakshatri means Ashwapurush and god of Ashwinikumar.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""अश्विनी नक्षत्रको अर्थ"" which refers to the meaning or significance of the Ashwini constellation. In the machine translation, this is translated as ""astrologer and goddess of astrology,"" which is incorrect. The reference translation correctly identifies the meaning as ""Ashwapurush"" (a person associated with the horse) and ""god of Ashwinikumar,"" which is a deity related to the constellation.

2. The machine translation conflates the two concepts, astrologer and deity, into a single term, while the reference translation separates them, correctly identifying the constellation as referring to a person and a god.

3. The word ""देवता"" in the source text refers to a goddess, but the machine translation omits this part, leading to a loss of information in the translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in that it incorrectly combines the concepts of an astrologer and a deity, omits the goddess aspect, and does not convey the full meaning of the source text. The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate interpretation of the Ashwini Nakshatri.

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: The Kingdom before this is the kingdom of Dot Raika Raika.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: A state before this is Doti Raika Rajbansha state.

Step 4: Compare the differences
- The machine translation uses ""kingdom of Dot Raika Raika"" which is a literal translation that combines two proper nouns, ""Doti"" and ""Raika Raika,"" without a clear meaning or context. The reference translation, on the other hand, separates them as ""Doti Raika Rajbansha state,"" indicating a specific historical or cultural context, where ""Rajbansha"" likely refers to a ruling family or a region.

- The source text uses ""राज्य सत्ता भनेको"" (rajya sattha bhaneko), which means ""a kingdom that speaks of"" or ""a kingdom that refers to,"" suggesting a historical or cultural reference. The machine translation omits this nuance, while the reference translation captures it by translating it as ""A state before this.""

- The reference translation also adds the word ""state"" to provide a clearer context, which is not present in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, nuance, and clarity. It combines the names without a clear meaning, while the reference translation separates them and provides a more contextually accurate translation. Additionally, the reference translation captures the idea of a historical or cultural reference that the source text implies.

|Machine translation: As much as we mind survival and sadness, there is a growing approach to survival and sadness in the us, including mental stability.|
|Reference translation: The more we meditate on good deeds and good thoughts, the more we have mental stability as well as a passion for good deeds and good thoughts.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Source to Machine Translation:**
   - ""जतिजति"" (survival and sadness) is translated as ""survival and sadness"" without specifying that it refers to meditating on these emotions.
   - ""हामी सत्कर्म र सद्विचारको मनन गर्दछौ"" (we meditate on good deeds and good thoughts) is translated as ""there is a growing approach to survival and sadness in the us"", which is a misinterpretation of the context, as it suggests a focus on these external aspects rather than internal meditation.

2. **Machine Translation to Reference Translation:**
   - The machine translation does not capture the concept of ""मनन"" (meditation) or the progression of ""the more"" (त्रुट्टों) in the original sentence, which is crucial for conveying the idea of increased mental stability and passion.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in several ways:
- It does not convey the act of meditation on good deeds and thoughts.
- It incorrectly interprets the focus on mental stability and the growth of passion for these actions.
- It omits the progression aspect of the sentence, which is present in the reference translation.

To improve the quality of the translation, the machine should capture the concept of meditation, maintain the focus on good deeds and thoughts, and convey the progression of the sentence accurately.

|Machine translation: Some educated youth work in the town's school and some government nonprofit offices.|
|Reference translation: Some educated youths work in village schools and some in government and non-government offices.|

|Analysis|
1. **""गाउँको"" vs ""town's""**: The source text uses ""गाउँको"" which refers to village schools, while the machine translation translates it as ""town's"" which is incorrect. The reference translation correctly uses ""village schools"".
2. **""सरकारी गैरसरकारी"" vs ""government and non-government""**: The source text combines ""सरकारी"" (government) and ""गैरसरकारी"" (non-government) into one phrase. The machine translation separates them into ""government nonprofit offices"", which is not accurate as ""गैरसरकारी"" does not necessarily mean ""nonprofit"". The reference translation correctly separates them as ""government and non-government offices"".
3. **No change in the structure of the sentence**: The overall structure of the sentence is preserved in both translations, but the meaning is altered due to the differences mentioned above.

In conclusion, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of ""गाउँको"" (village schools) and the handling of the ""सरकारी गैरसरकारी"" phrase, which affects the accuracy of the translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Nepali text.

Step 1: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- कुनै व्यक्ती (any person)
- यसलाई बिना कुनै गल्ती (without any mistake)
- जस्ताको त्यस्तै नैं लेखि (exactly as that)
- देवस् (Vyas)
- जसरी व्यास भन्दै (as Vyas would recite)
- जान्थे (knew)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: Writers like those who were wrong with no contradiction, as they knew the interest.
- Reference translation: If anyone could write it without mistake exactly how Vyas would recite it.

Step 3: Analyze the differences:
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""कुनै व्यक्ती"" (any person) as ""writers,"" which changes the subject and context.
- ""यसलाई बिना कुनै गल्ती"" (without any mistake) is translated as ""with no contradiction,"" which is not accurate. It should convey the idea of writing without errors.
- ""जस्ताको त्यस्तै नैं लेखि"" (exactly as that) is translated as ""as they knew the interest,"" which does not convey the intended meaning of writing in the same manner as Vyas.
- ""देवस्"" (Vyas) is mentioned in both, but the context is different in the machine translation.
- ""जसरी व्यास भन्दै"" (as Vyas would recite) is not present in the machine translation, which is a crucial part of the original sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of subject, context, and the specific reference to Vyas' recitation style. The quality of the translation is poor due to these inaccuracies.

Step 3: Read the reference translation

- The source text talks about ""माओवादीहरू"" (Maoists) and ""उनीहरूका र्समर्थकहरू"" (their supporters) being ""दमन गरियो"" (suppressed) with ""क्रूर"" (cruelty).
- The machine translation, however, mentions ""The cross"" which is not present in the source text. It seems to have misinterpreted the context.

|Source: सन् १९९८ पछि म्याकमेन अस्टिनको उनमाथिको व्यवहार र उनी डब्ल्युडब्ल्युएफ विश्व विजेताको रूपमा रहिरहेको हेर्न चाहदैनथे।|
|Machine translation: After 1998, Mcmain Austin's behaviour on her and she did not want to see rhyming as a WWF World Winner.|
|Reference translation: After 1998, McMahon did not want to see Austin's treatment of him and him remaining as a WWF World Champion.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject**: In the source, ""म्याकमेन"" (Mcmain) is the subject, but in the machine translation, it's incorrectly translated as ""Mcmain Austin"" (which is a combination of two names). The correct subject should be ""म्याकमेन"" (McMahon).
2. **Object**: The source refers to ""अस्टिनको उनमाथिको व्यवहार"" (Austin's treatment towards him), but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""on her and she"". The correct object should be ""him"" (reflected in the reference translation).
3. **Action**: The source uses ""रहिरहेको"" (remaining), which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, it says ""as a WWF World Winner,"" which is a different context. The reference translation correctly uses ""remaining"" to describe the situation.
4. **Translation of ""हेर्न""**: The source mentions ""हेर्न"" (Hern), which is likely a misspelling or a name that should be translated differently. The reference translation does not include this name, so it's unclear if it's a correct omission.

In summary, the machine translation has issues with subject identification, object translation, and the context of Austin's treatment. The reference translation provides a more accurate representation of the source text.

|Source: उत्तरभाद्रपद नक्षत्रमा जन्मिएका जातकले मासुमाछा जस्ता खानेकुरा निचजातिका मान्छेलाई दान गर्दा शुभफलको प्राप्ति हुन्छ।|
|Machine translation: Jatak, born in northvadrupad nagar, is the recipient of the guest when he dances a man of food niches like meat.|
|Reference translation: A person born in Uttarbhadra constellation gets good fortune by donating food such as meat and fish to the people of lower caste.|

|Analysis|
1. **Source**: The source text mentions ""उत्तरभाद्रपद नक्षत्रमा"" (Uttarbhadra constellation) and ""मासुमाछा जस्ता खानेकुरा"" (food like meat).
2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""उत्तरभाद्रपद"" as ""northvadrupad nagar"" (which is not a proper translation of the constellation), and it misunderstands ""मासुमाछा जस्ता खानेकुरा"" as ""a man of food niches like meat"" (which is a literal and incorrect interpretation).
3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation correctly translates ""उत्तरभाद्रपद"" as ""Uttarbhadra constellation"" and ""मासुमाछा जस्ता खानेकुरा"" as ""food such as meat and fish.""

|Conclusion|
The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the interpretation of the constellation and the meaning of the food mentioned. The machine translation is not accurate in conveying the original Nepali text's meaning. The reference translation better captures the context and meaning of the source.|

|Source: यस्तो विवरण सुनेर क्रोधित भई कुबेरले उसलाई स्त्रीवियोग र मृत्युलोकमा जन्म लिई कोढरोगग्रस्त हुने श्राप दिए।|
|Machine translation: And it came to pass, when he heard the wrath, that he cursed the woman, and the woman's birth, and the woman's death.|
|Reference translation: Kuber got angry with such a description and cursed him to be separated from his wife and born on earth suffering leprosy.|

Analysis:
1. The source text starts with ""यस्तो विवरण सुनेर"" which means ""when he heard such a description"", but the machine translation omits this context and directly jumps to ""when he heard the wrath"".
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""स्त्रीवियोग"" as ""the woman's birth"" and ""मृत्युलोकमा"" as ""and the woman's death"". In the reference translation, these phrases are combined to mean ""separated from his wife"" and ""born on earth"", respectively.
3. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""कोढरोगग्रस्त"" as ""suffering leprosy"", which is a literal translation without considering the context of the curse. The reference translation captures the meaning of the curse more accurately.

In summary, the machine translation loses the context of the story, misinterprets the phrases ""स्त्रीवियोग"" and ""मृत्युलोकमा"", and does not convey the intended meaning of the curse as effectively as the reference translation.

|Source: सत्र वर्षमा विवाह भएकी महिला ३५ वर्षको युवा उमेरमा हजुरामा बन्न सक्छिन् ।|
|Machine translation: Women who were married in seventeen years could become injured at a young age of 35.|
|Reference translation: A woman who gets married at the age of seventeen can become a grandmother at a young age of 35.|

**Analysis:**

1. **Misinterpretation of the verb**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""भएकी"" (married) as ""could become injured"" (which implies a physical harm), while the reference translation correctly interprets it as ""who gets married"" (past tense of ""भएका"" in the context of marriage).

2. **Misunderstanding of the context**: The machine translation suggests a scenario of women being injured at a young age, which is not the intended meaning of the source sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, conveys the idea that a woman who marries at 17 can become a grandmother at 35, which is a more accurate reflection of the Nepali sentence's meaning.

3. **Age difference**: The machine translation does not capture the age difference (17 years) between marriage and becoming a grandmother, which is a crucial aspect of the original sentence.

4. **Lack of cultural context**: The reference translation includes the cultural aspect of the Nepali sentence, which is about the unusual life stage transition, while the machine translation does not.

In summary, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of context, interpretation, and cultural nuances, leading to a lower quality translation.

Step 1: Identify the main ideas in the source text
- The novel is not psychoanalytic
- The author's analysis of psychoanalysis is used in the novel
- The analysis is considered valid or logical

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the source text
- Machine translation: Although this novel is not psychoanalytic, his analysis of psychoanalysis has been used in only a few.
- Source text: साथै यस उपन्यास मनोवैज्ञानिक नभए पनि केही मात्रमा मनोविश्लेषणको प्रयोग गरिएको छ भन्ने उनको विश्लेषण पनि औचित्यपूर्ण रहेको छ ।

- Differences:
  - The machine translation omits the phrase ""साथै"" (also) which indicates a contrast or additional point.
  - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""नभए पनि केही मात्रमा"" (not only a few) as ""has been used in only a few,"" which changes the meaning to imply that the analysis is limited, rather than the novel being psychoanalytic.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: Although this novel is not psychoanalytic, his analysis of psychoanalysis has been used in only a few.
- Reference translation: His analysis that this novel is not psychologica but psychoanalysis is used , is also rationale .

- Differences:
  - The reference translation correctly captures the contrast by using ""is also rationale"" to indicate that the analysis is valid despite the novel not being psychoanalytic.
  - The reference translation uses ""psychologica"" instead of ""psychoanalytic,"" which is a more accurate term in this context.

Conclusion: The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the contrast it presents and the accuracy of the term ""psychoanalytic."" The reference translation better captures the intended meaning and structure of the source text.

|Source: १८४७ साल भाद्र ३१ गते गोर्खाले डोटी राज्य बिजय गरेपछि डोटी राज्यको वर्तमान भारतको सिंगाही,लखनौ सम्मनको सम्पूर्णभूमि गोर्खा राज्यको हुन् गयो ।|
|Machine translation: After the 1847 Southern 31st gorkha bisected the dot kingdom, the present india of Singhi, Lucknow, is the whole of the gorkha kingdom.|
|Reference translation: After the conquest of the Doti kingdom by the Gurkhas on 31 September 1847, the entire territory of the present Doti kingdom of Singhahi, Lucknow, India, became part of the Gurkha kingdom.|

Analysis:
1. The source text uses ""भाद्र ३१"" (Bhadra 31), which is a Nepali month and day, while the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""Southern 31st"" without specifying the month. The reference translation correctly mentions ""31 September 1847.""
2. The source text refers to ""डोटी राज्य"" (Doti kingdom), which is a specific region, whereas the machine translation generalizes it to ""the dot kingdom"" without the context. The reference translation specifies ""Doti kingdom of Singhahi.""
3. The source text uses ""गोर्खाले"" (by the Gurkhas), which indicates the conquerors, while the machine translation omits this detail. The reference translation includes this information.
4. The source text states that the area became ""गोर्खा राज्यको हुन् गयो"" (part of the Gorkha kingdom), while the machine translation incorrectly suggests that the whole of ""India"" became part of the Gorkha kingdom. The reference translation correctly specifies that it was the ""Doti kingdom"" of Singhahi and Lucknow that became part of the Gorkha kingdom.

In summary, the machine translation has several inaccuracies, including the incorrect translation of the date, generalization of the region, and the incorrect attribution of the entire territory to the Gorkha kingdom. The reference translation provides a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation.

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the source text
- ""अर्को हप्ताको"" (next week)
- ""रमा म्याकमेनले"" (Ruma Mcmain)
- ""डोनाल्ड ट्रम्पबाट"" (Donald Trump)
- ""फेरि खरिद गरेको"" (purchased again)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: ""Over the next week, Ruma Mcmain said he had purchased again from Donald Trump.""
- Reference translation: ""In next week 's RAW, Mcmain told he purchased back from Donald Trump.""

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""Over the next week"" while the reference translation uses ""In next week's RAW."" RAW likely stands for a specific show or event, which is not explicitly mentioned in the source but is implied by the context. The machine translation omits this context.
2. The verb ""bātt"" in the source text, which is a suffix indicating past tense, is not translated in the machine translation. Instead, the machine translation uses ""he had purchased,"" which is a past perfect tense, but the reference translation uses ""told he purchased,"" which is more consistent with the past tense in the source.

Step 3: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of context (RAW) and verb tense. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the original Nepali sentence, while the machine translation loses some nuances and context.

|Machine translation: Chávez also held appointments with the peoples of cuiva and yaruro as well as the sangor wassoon.|
|Reference translation: Chavez also met with indigenous persons like Kuyiva and Yaaruro who resided in organized way.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""चाभेजले कुइभा तथा यारूरो"" (Chávez with Kuyiva and Yaaruro), which are proper names or specific ethnic groups, not appointments.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""जस्ता सांगठनिक वसोवासगर्ने"" (like those living in organized settlements) as ""as well as the sangor wassoon,"" which is a nonsensical phrase and does not convey the intended meaning of organized communities.
3. The reference translation correctly identifies these individuals as ""indigenous persons"" and specifies that they resided in an ""organized way.""

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. It misinterprets the context, specifically regarding the nature of the meetings (appointments vs. meetings with indigenous people) and the description of the communities (organized settlements vs. a nonsensical term). The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate representation of the source text.

|Reference translation: The deities there call Rajwar as Kshatre , Rajwar 's brother as Jhal , Brahmin as Takalo , Vaishyajati as Laudia and Dalit as Hin.|
|Analysis:|
1. **Difference in word translation**: The machine translation does not accurately capture the meaning of the source text. It translates ""देवताहरु"" (deities) as ""the gods of Razwar,"" which is a partial translation. The correct translation should be ""the deities there"" or ""the gods present.""
2. **Misinterpretation of ""रजवारलाई क्षत्रे""**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""रजवारलाई क्षत्रे"" (Rajwar as Kshatre) as ""the brother of Razwar."" The correct interpretation is that it refers to the deity associated with the title ""Kshatre.""
3. **Incorrect translation of ""झाल""**: The machine translation does not provide a suitable translation for ""झाल,"" which is a term used to refer to Rajwar's brother. It is likely a regional or specific term that the machine translator is not familiar with.
4. **Misidentification of ""लौडिया""**: The machine translation translates ""वैश्यजातिलाई लौडिया"" (Vaishyajati as Laudia) as ""the scene,"" which is incorrect. ""लौडिया"" is a term related to Vaishyajati, likely a caste or group, and should be translated as ""Vaishyajati as Laudia.""
5. **Incorrect translation of ""दलितलाई हिन""**: The machine translation translates ""दलितलाई हिन"" (Dalit as Hin) as ""the palace,"" which is not accurate. ""हिन"" is a term that refers to the Dalit community, and the correct translation should be ""Dalit as Hin.""

In summary, the machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of word choice, cultural context, and specific terms, leading to a loss of meaning and accuracy.

|Reference translation: At Devaki 's wedding, King Kamsha was going to take Vashudev and Devaki in a chariot and drive the chariot to his house.|

Analysis:
1. **Subject and context**: The source text mentions ""राजा कंश"" (King Kamsha) and ""देवकीको विवाहमा"" (Devaki's wedding), which is crucial for understanding the context. The machine translation omits this context, referring to ""king Cedar's wife"" instead, which is a misinterpretation.
2. **Action and participants**: The source states that ""वशुदेव र देवकीलाई रथमा राखेर"" (Vashudev and Devaki were taken in a chariot), while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""laid her chariot in the chariot"" and ""laid her chariot in her house,"" suggesting a different action.
3. **Destination**: The source mentions ""उनको घरमा पुगाउन जाँदै"" (driving the chariot to his house), which is not clearly conveyed in the machine translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of context, action, and destination, leading to a less accurate representation of the source text.

|Analysis|
1. **""उता त्रिचन्द्र कलेजमा""** (at Tri-chandra College) vs. **""Utah Tricho College""** - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""त्रिचन्द्र"" (Tri-chandra) as ""Utah Tricho"", which is a different college name.
2. **""अध्ययनरत छात्रहरूले""** (students studying) vs. **""The shadows studied""** - The machine translation incorrectly translates the group of students as ""shadows"" instead of referring to them as students.
3. **""नेपाल छात्र संघको स्थापना""** (establishing the Nepal Student Union) vs. **""the Nepal Shadow Association""** - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""छात्र संघ"" (student union) as ""Shadow Association"", which is not the typical term for a student union in this context.
4. **""प्रजातान्त्रिक आन्दोलनमा""** (in the democratic movement) vs. **""advocating themselves in the provincial assembly""** - The machine translation omits the context of the democratic movement and instead suggests a more general action of advocating in a provincial assembly, which is not accurate.

Analysis:
1. **Timeframe**: The machine translation incorrectly combines the two timeframes, ""65 years"" and ""30 years,"" into a single ""30 years"" period, which is not accurate according to the source text. The reference translation correctly separates these two timeframes, specifying ""last 30 years"" and ""65 years and above.""
2. **Age group**: The source text mentions ""65 वर्ष र सो भन्दा माथिको"" (people aged 65 and above), which is not clearly conveyed in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""aged 65 and above.""
3. **Population increase**: The machine translation states that the population has increased ""to 7.4 percent over a period of 30 years,"" which implies a single percentage point increase. However, the source text suggests a more significant increase from 5.8% to 7.4%, which is not captured in the machine translation.

In summary, the machine translation loses the distinction between the two timeframes and does not accurately convey the magnitude of the population increase for the older age group. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text.

Step 1: Read the source text
Source: सुमेरियन कालमा राज्य सत्ताको नाममा अनेक लडाइ तथा युद्धहरू हुने गर्दथे।

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: During the sumerian era, there were numerous battles and battles in the name of the kingdom surviving.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: During the sumerian era, there were numerous battles and wars in the name of the kingdom surviving.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation
- The machine translation uses ""battles and battles"" while the reference translation uses ""battles and wars."" The difference here is that ""battles"" is a more general term, and ""wars"" implies a more significant conflict, which might be the intended meaning in this context.
- The machine translation omits the word ""तथा"" (and) in the source text. This conjunction is important to maintain the connection between ""battles"" and ""wars.""
- The machine translation has ""surviving"" at the end, which is not present in the source text. It might be an attempt to convey the idea that the kingdom persisted through these conflicts, but it's not directly translated.

Step 5: Conclusion
The machine translation differs from the reference translation in terms of the choice of words (""battles"" vs. ""wars"") and the omission of the conjunction ""तथा."" Additionally, it adds the word ""surviving"" which is not in the source text. The reference translation better captures the meaning and structure of the original Nepali sentence.

1. **Source meaning**: The sentence discusses the Tamang belief that when a Myna bird's beak feeds a baby, the child will have a sweet disposition, similar to the bird.

2. **Machine translation difference:**
   - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""चुच्चोले"" (the beak of the Myna bird) as ""the spoil of the mana party"" and ""नवजात शिशु"" (newborn baby) as ""the grain of the Shishu"" and ""mistaken as the novice mana."" This is a significant misunderstanding, as it completely changes the meaning of the original text.
   - The phrase ""त्यो नवजात शिशु मैनाको जस्तो मिष्टभाषी हुन्छ"" (the newborn baby will be as sweet-spoken as the Myna) is not accurately translated, with ""mishthabhashi"" (sweet-spoken) being omitted.

3. **Corrected machine translation**: According to the Tamangs, if the Myna bird's beak feeds the baby, the newborn baby will be as sweet-tempered as the Myna.

|Source: रतनसिहका तीनपुत्रहरु क्रमसः कालुसिह बम, चन्द्रभान बम र नैनबहादुर बम भए ।|
|Machine translation: Ratsih's three successors were: Kalusih Bomb, moonvan bomb, and nonbahadur bomb.|
|Reference translation: Ratan Singh 's three sons were Kalu Singh Bam , Chandrabhan Bam and Nain Bahadur Bam respectively .|

Analysis:

1. **Subject identification**: The source text refers to ""रतनसिहका तीनपुत्रहरु"" (Ratan Singh's three sons), while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""Ratsih's three successors."" The reference translation correctly identifies the subject as Ratan Singh's sons.

2. **Names**: The source mentions ""कालुसिह बम"" (Kalu Singh Bam), ""चन्द्रभान बम"" (Chandrabhan Bam), and ""नैनबहादुर बम"" (Nain Bahadur Bam) as the names of the sons. The machine translation incorrectly translates these as ""Kalusih Bomb,"" ""moonvan bomb,"" and ""nonbahadur bomb,"" which are not names but seem to be a mix of the original names and a possible misunderstanding.

3. **Order and word choice**: The source uses ""क्रमसः"" (in that order) to indicate the sequence, which is not directly translated in the machine translation. Instead, the machine translation presents the names in a different order, which is not accurate.

4. **Punctuation and apostrophe**: The reference translation uses an apostrophe to indicate possession (Ratan Singh's sons) and separates the names with commas, which is more natural in English. The machine translation does not include these elements.

In conclusion, the machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of subject identification, name accuracy, and the correct representation of the sequence and word choice. The machine translation should be revised to accurately reflect the names and the relationship between Ratan Singh and his sons.

|Source: जतिजति मानिसमा आध्यात्मिक ग्यान बढ्दै जान्छ त्यही अनुपातमा उसको सकारात्मक पनमा बृद्धि हुदै जान्छ ।|
|Machine translation: As the damned gan rises, the proportion of his positive gan rises.|
|Reference translation: As the spritual knowledge increases in Human , his positivity also increases in the same proportion.|

**Analysis:**

1. **词汇差异**: ""जतिजति"" (damned) in the machine translation is a literal translation that does not convey the intended meaning of ""मानिसमा"" (Human) in the source text. The reference translation uses ""Human"" to make it clear.
2. **词性转换错误**: ""ग्यान"" (knowledge) is translated as ""gan"" in the machine translation, which is incorrect. The reference translation correctly uses ""spiritual knowledge.""
3. **文化理解**: ""सकारात्मक पनमा"" (positive gan) in the machine translation is a literal translation that might not be familiar to English speakers, while the reference translation uses ""positivity"" which is a more common term in English.
4. **句子结构**: The machine translation has a slightly awkward structure, with ""the proportion of his positive gan rises"" following ""the damned gan rises,"" which is not as clear as the reference translation's structure, ""his positivity also increases in the same proportion.""

Overall, the machine translation loses some meaning and nuance, and the structure is not as clear as the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the essence of the source text.

|Reference translation: He used to earn cash by selling buffalo ghee, there was no market for ghee everywhere.|

|Analysis:|
1. The source text talks about ""भैशीको घिउ"" (buffalo ghee) and ""नगद आम्दानी"" (cash income) which are specific to the context of selling ghee.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""घिउ बेचेर"" (selling buffalo ghee) as ""the cash was income"" and ""घिउ  बेच्नको लागि"" (for the purpose of selling ghee) as ""and the cash was income.""
3. The phrase ""ठाउँमा बजार थिएँन्"" (markets were there) is not accurately translated as ""in all places"" in the machine translation. Instead, it should be translated as ""there was no market for ghee everywhere.""

|Reference translation: Seeing this, Lord Krishna also sat down meditating under a tree and a hunter's arrow hit him at his feet, causing him to go to his Paramdham Gaman.|
|Analysis:|
1. **Subject**: The source text refers to ""श्रीकृष्ण"" (Lord Krishna), while the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""Mr. Sutherland"". This is a significant difference in the subject.
2. **Action**: The source describes Lord Krishna ""बेठ गये"" (sat down), which is translated to ""listened"" in the machine translation, which is not accurate.
3. **Context**: The meditation under a tree is not mentioned in the machine translation, which is an important part of the scene.
4. **Event**: The machine translation incorrectly combines ""the bottom of a pedestal"" with ""the eight guys"" and ""the arrows of a hunter,"" which are unrelated elements in the source text. The reference translation correctly connects the arrow to the hunter and the impact on Lord Krishna.
5. **Term**: ""Paramdham Gaman"" (going to his ultimate abode) is a religious term specific to the context, which is not translated in the machine translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
|im_start|
Step 1: Compare the source text with the machine translation.
- Source: उसलाई घाइते बनाउने, चलाउने वा प्रत्यक्ष सम्पर्कमा आएपछि
- Machine translation: He attacks for defense only after being wounded, runaway or direct contact.

The machine translation has a few differences:
1. ""उसलाई घाइते बनाउने"" (it makes it injured) is translated as ""being wounded"" which is a direct translation but loses the nuance of the original verb ""घाइते बनाउने"" (to make it injured).
2. ""चलाउने"" (running away) is translated as ""runaway"" which is a close approximation but omits the verb aspect.
3. ""प्रत्यक्ष सम्पर्कमा आएपछि"" (after coming into direct contact) is translated as ""direct contact"" but the original phrase includes the additional context of ""after coming into contact.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: He attacks for defense only after being wounded, runaway or direct contact.
- Reference translation: It attacks in self defense only when it is injured, teased or is in direct contact.

The reference translation:
1. Adds the word ""teased"" (which is missing in the machine translation) to provide a more complete context for when the attack occurs.
2. Uses ""in self defense"" instead of ""for defense"" which is a more accurate and idiomatic expression in English.

Conclusion: The machine translation has differences in the verb aspect, the addition of ""teased,"" and the use of ""in self defense"" instead of ""for defense."" The reference translation provides a more nuanced and accurate representation of the source text.

|Analysis|
1. The source text lists Nepali districts, while the machine translation incorrectly translates ""डोटी"" (Doti) as ""kollam"" and introduces ""Dracula"" which is not a district in Nepal. This is a significant error.
2. The reference translation correctly uses the Nepali names for the districts, maintaining the original context.
3. The structure of the sentence is also different in the machine translation, which uses ""including"" followed by a list, while the reference translation uses ""including"" followed by a more direct list of district names.

|Reference translation: Bhima attacked in his thigh and killed him.|

|Analysis|
1. The source text is about Bhima (a character) performing an action, specifically attacking someone in the thigh.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""छ्लदेखि"" (thigh) as ""the roof"" and ""त्यसलाई मार डाला"" (killed him) as ""kills her,"" which is a gender misinterpretation.
3. The reference translation accurately conveys the action (attack) and the body part (thigh) and the correct pronoun (him) without any confusion about the location or gender.

|Conclusion|
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the body part targeted and the gender of the victim. The correct translation should be ""Bhima attacked in his thigh and killed him,"" which aligns with the reference translation.

|Machine translation: Motiram Bhatt wrote many books concerning series, devotion and nationality, including a series of books he needed to become a producer.|
|Reference translation: Motiram Bhatta wrote many poems on eroticism, devotion and nationality, but he became the creator of erotic poems.|

|Analysis|
1. **Subject and verb**: The source text refers to ""मोतीराम भट्टले"" (Motiram Bhatta) as the subject, while the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""Motiram Bhatt"" as if it's a single book or a person unrelated to the poet.
2. **Topic**: The source mentions ""श्रृङ्गर"" (eroticism), ""भक्ति"" (devotion), and ""राष्ट्रियताका"" (nationality) as topics, but the machine translation incorrectly translates these as ""series"" and ""nationality"" without specifying the context of poetry.
3. **Type of works**: The source specifies that the poems are ""श्रृङ्गारिक"" (erotic), while the machine translation incorrectly suggests that he wrote ""books"" (which could include non-poetic works) and mentions a ""series of books"" to become a producer, which is unrelated to the context.
4. **Conclusion**: The machine translation significantly deviates from the reference translation in terms of subject, topic, and the nature of the works. The reference translation accurately captures the essence of the source, highlighting Motiram Bhatta's focus on poetry, particularly on eroticism, devotion, and nationality, and his role as a creator of such poems.

|Reference translation: He graduated from Fishburne Military School in Virginia in 1964.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""फिसबर्न सैनिक विद्यालय"" (Fishburne Military School), which is a proper noun and should not be translated word-for-word. In the machine translation, it is translated as ""fishburne military school,"" which omits the word ""सैनिक"" (military) and adds a space between ""fishburne"" and ""military,"" altering the meaning.
2. The word order in the machine translation is slightly different from the reference, placing ""in Virginia"" after the school name instead of at the end. This changes the sentence structure and makes it less natural in English.
3. The year ""सन् १९६४"" (1964) is translated correctly in both, but the reference places it after the location, which is standard in English.

|Reference translation: This incident is most dangerous terrorist attack in Pakistan 's history since the Karachi bomb attacks in 2007.|

Analysis:
1. The machine translation uses ""the most dangerous terrorist attack"" while the reference translation uses ""most dangerous terrorist attack"". Both convey the same meaning but the reference translation omits the ""the"" before ""most dangerous"", which is a minor difference in style.
2. The machine translation has ""after the karachi bombings in 2007"", while the reference translation has ""since the Karachi bomb attacks in 2007"". Both phrases mean the same thing, but ""since"" implies a broader context of all attacks that occurred after the Karachi bombings, whereas ""after"" suggests a specific point in time. The reference translation is slightly more precise in this context.
3. The machine translation uses ""in the history of Pakistan"", which is accurate but redundant with the previous clause. The reference translation omits this phrase, making the sentence more concise.

|Reference translation: There are 60 thousand verses in the book called Dhanush Chandrodaya composed by Parashuram.|

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions a ""dhनुष चन्द्रोदय"" (Dhanush Chandrodaya), which is the name of the book, not a grant. The machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""bow chandroshan,"" which is a misinterpretation.
2. The source text states that the book was ""रचना गरेको"" (created by) Parashuram, while the machine translation says it was ""constructed by"" parshuram, which implies a physical construction rather than the creation of a literary work.
3. The reference translation correctly uses the term ""verses"" (श्लोक) to describe the content, whereas the machine translation uses ""shloks,"" which is a direct translation but might not convey the intended meaning of a poetic or literary unit.

- Incorrectly translating the book's name as ""bow chandroshan"" instead of ""Dhanush Chandrodaya.""
- Describing the creation of the work as ""constructed"" instead of ""created.""
- Using ""shloks"" instead of ""verses"" to describe the content, which might not convey the poetic nature of the text.

Source: पुनरुक्तिहरू र मात्रागत विचलनलाई पनि शैली विज्ञानले सकारात्मक विशेषताका रूपमा लिएको

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Restorations and amount of deficiency also taken by style science as a positive feature

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: Repetitions and quantitative deviations are also taken as positive features by stylistics

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text mentions ""पुनरुक्तिहरू"" (repetitions) and ""मात्रागत विचलनलाई"" (amount of quantitative deviations), which are not directly translated as ""restorations"" and ""amount of deficiency"" in the machine translation.
- The machine translation uses ""style science"" instead of ""शैली विज्ञान"" (stylistics) from the source.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- The machine translation omits the specific terms ""पुनरुक्तिहरू"" and ""मात्रागत विचलनलाई"" and replaces them with more general terms ""restorations"" and ""amount of deficiency.""
- The reference translation correctly translates ""शैली विज्ञान"" as ""stylistics.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the specific terms used for repetitions and quantitative deviations, and it does not capture the full meaning of the source text.

Step 1: Understand the source text
The source text is in Nepali and says, ""गुम्बामा कहिल्यै ननिभ्ने एक निमबत्ती नियमित रूपमा बल्दछ।"" This sentence can be translated to English as, ""A candle in the monastery burns regularly without ever going out.""

Step 2: Compare the machine translation
The machine translation provided is, ""A Nimbat regularly burns never to gumba."" Here, ""Nimbat"" seems to be a mistranslation or a word that does not convey the intended meaning of ""candle"" from Nepali. Additionally, ""never to gumba"" does not make sense in the context of the sentence.

Step 3: Compare with the reference translation
The reference translation is, ""A never-ending candle burns regularly in the monastery."" This translation captures the essence of the source text, maintaining the idea of a candle burning continuously and regularly in a monastery.

Step 4: Identify differences
The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are:
- The machine translation uses ""Nimbat"" instead of ""candle"" (निमबत्ती), which is incorrect.
- The machine translation has a nonsensical phrase ""never to gumba,"" while the reference translation correctly conveys the idea of the candle burning without ever going out.
- The structure of the sentence is also different, with the reference translation placing ""in the monastery"" at the end, which is more natural in English.

|Analysis|
1. **Subject identification**: The source mentions ""छत्रपती शिवाजी महाराजको विवाह"" (marriage of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj), while the machine translation incorrectly refers to ""the sixth shivaji maharaj"" without specifying that it's Chhatrapati Shivaji. This is a significant difference.
2. **Verb and action**: The source uses ""भएको थियो"" (took place), which is a passive form indicating the event occurred. The machine translation uses ""was held"", which is a more common English phrasing but does not convey the passive voice.
3. **Object and location**: The source specifies ""साइवाईं निम्बालेर सँग"" (with Saiwai from Nimbale) and ""लालमहलमा"" (at Lalmahal). The machine translation combines these into ""with siwai following on 14 May 1640"", which is less clear and omits the location.
4. **Date**: Both the source and reference translation correctly mention the date ""14 मे १६४०"" (14 May 1640).

1. The source text is in Nepali, discussing a civil war and the lack of agreement between political parties.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""माओवादी जनयुद्ध"" (Maoist civil war) as ""the maiden"" and ""दलहरूबीच"" (between political parties) as ""between the companies,"" which is a literal and incorrect interpretation.
3. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning, translating ""माओवादी जनयुद्ध"" as ""civil war"" and ""दलहरूबीच"" as ""between political parties.""

Conclusion:
The machine translation is of poor quality because it misrepresents the subject matter and the relationship between the parties involved. The correct translation should reflect the context of a civil war and the political parties, not a literal translation of the words. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

|Source: प्रशासनमा सुधार गरी लोक सेवा आयोग र स्वातन्त्र न्यापालिकाको स्थापना जस्ता परिपाटीको थालनी भयो।|
|Machine translation: Improvements in administration initiated such as the establishment of a population service commission and swat judiciary.|
|Reference translation: The trend like establishment of Public Service Commision after reforms in administration and independent judiciary.|

|Analysis:|
1. **""प्रशासनमा सुधार गरी""** (Improvements in administration) - Machine translation: ""Improvements in administration initiated"" - The reference translation omits the word ""initiated"" which makes the sentence sound more passive in the reference, but the machine translation is more direct.
2. **""लोक सेवा आयोग""** (Population Service Commission) - Machine translation: ""population service commission"" - The reference translation uses ""Public Service Commision"" which is a more common English term for a similar body.
3. **""स्वातन्त्र न्यापालिकाको स्थापना""** (establishment of an independent judiciary) - Machine translation: ""swat judiciary"" - The machine translation incorrectly assumes ""swat"" is a part of the judiciary's name, while the reference translation correctly uses ""independent judiciary.""
4. **""जस्ता परिपाटीको थालनी भयो""** (The trend worries) - Machine translation: ""such as"" - This phrase is not accurately translated, as it implies a list of examples, but the reference translation conveys the idea of a worrying trend.

In summary, the machine translation has differences in the choice of words, specifically in the translation of ""स्वातन्त्र न्यापालिकाको स्थापना"" and the overall structure, which affects the meaning and clarity of the sentence. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Nepali text in terms of meaning and context.|

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:

Step 1: Identify the main components of the source text
- Subject: जुन ठाउँ (old place)
- Action: पानी र माटोको तौल (weight of water and clay)
- Condition: बराबर हुन्छ (equal)
- Conclusion: उत्तम हुन्छ (is the best)
- Context: खोज्दै हिड्ने क्रममा (while searching)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: The place which is equal to the weight of the water and of the clay, which is bestowed upon it, that the Banni came to pass through.
- Reference translation: Banni had come while searching for a place saying that the place where the weight of water and soil is equal, is the best.

Step 3: Analyze differences
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""ठाउँ"" (place) as ""the place which is equal to the weight of the water and of the clay"" instead of ""the place where the weight of water and clay is equal.""
- The phrase ""भन्दै त्यस्तो ठाउँ खोज्दै हिड्ने"" (while searching for that place) is not accurately translated, as it is not clearly stated that the Banni was coming ""to pass through"" the place.
- The conclusion ""उत्तम हुन्छ"" (is the best) is missing in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation has significant differences in capturing the meaning and structure of the source text, particularly in the description of the condition and the context of the Banni's action. The reference translation better reflects the original Nepali sentence.

|Source: राजाले प्रतिकूल अवस्थामा परदेश जानु परेको थियो, हालको ऐश्वर्ययुक्त र वैभवपूर्ण अवस्था देख्दा|
|Machine translation: The King had to go astray, and to the queen if he didn't return to the king anymore, when he saw the current hierarchy and the imperial state.|
|Reference translation: The King had to go foreign land in unfavourable conditions, the queen got concerned that the king will not return by seeing the state full of splendor and prosperity.|

|Analysis|
1. **""राजाले प्रतिकूल अवस्थामा परदेश जानु परेको थियो""** (The King had to go foreign land in unfavourable conditions) - Machine translation: ""The King had to go astray"" is a less precise translation. ""Astray"" implies a loss of direction or way, while ""foreign land in unfavourable conditions"" conveys a more specific context of going to a different country under difficult circumstances.
2. **""हालको ऐश्वर्ययुक्त र वैभवपूर्ण अवस्था""** (the current hierarchy and the imperial state) - Machine translation: ""the current hierarchy and the imperial state"" is translated as ""the current hierarchy and the imperial state,"" which is a direct translation but loses the nuance of the original. The reference translation uses ""state full of splendor and prosperity"" to convey the idea of the impressive condition, which is more vivid.
3. **""देख्दा कतै राजा त फर्कदैनन भने""** (the queen got concerned that the king will not return) - Machine translation: ""when he saw the current hierarchy and the imperial state, when he didn't return to the king anymore"" implies a potential future event, while the reference translation directly states ""the queen got concerned"" without the condition, making it clearer.

In summary, the machine translation is less precise in conveying the context of the King's situation and the Queen's concern, and it loses some of the vividness in describing the state. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the original Nepali text.

|Machine translation: The Constitution of Nepal was introduced in 2047, as some laws concerning the royal seventh and king's rights were not explicitly adopted by the king because the king could raise this step.|
|Reference translation: The King was able to take this step as some of the provisions in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 2047 regarding the state power and the rights of the king were not clear.|

|Analysis|
1. **Time reference**: The machine translation incorrectly refers to ""royal seventh"" instead of ""state power"" (राजकीय सत्ता) in the context of the Constitution. This is a mistranslation.
2. **Adoption of laws**: The machine translation suggests that the king could raise a step because some laws were not explicitly adopted, which implies a passive action. The reference translation, however, states that the king was able to take a step because the provisions were not clear, which implies an active ability to act.
3. **Clarity of provisions**: The machine translation uses ""because the king could raise this step,"" which is not as clear as the reference translation's ""as some of the provisions were not clear.""

In summary, the machine translation differs from the reference translation in its interpretation of the context, specifically regarding the state power, the king's ability to act, and the clarity of the provisions in the Constitution. The reference translation is clearer and more accurate in conveying the intended meaning.

|Reference translation: Shivaji , with an army of four thousand , plundered the wealthy merchants of Surat for six days , did not plunder the common man , and returned again .|

|Analysis|
1. The source text mentions ""छः दिनहरुसम्म"" (six days), which is translated as ""six days to the wealthy merchants"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly translates this as ""for six days"".
2. The source text uses ""लूटा सामान्य आदमिलाई नहि"" (did not loot the common man), which is not accurately translated in the machine translation. It incorrectly translates this as ""looted general Adami"". The reference translation correctly omits ""general Adami"" and conveys the idea that Shivaji did not loot the common people.
3. The machine translation adds ""and went to the staff again"" which is not present in the source text. The reference translation omits this part, which is more appropriate as it focuses on the main event of looting and returning.

In conclusion, the machine translation has differences in the handling of time duration, the exclusion of the common people, and the addition of a non-existent detail about going to the staff. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text in terms of meaning and structure.

|Machine translation: It goes on to match the special guest from the state of Rahu with such a treacherous guilt.|
|Reference translation: But from such a flawless position of Rahu, special auspicious results are obtained.|

Analysis:
1. The source text talks about a ""दोषरहित"" (flawless) position of Rahu, which refers to a concept in astrology, not a ""state"" or ""treacherous guilt"" as in the machine translation.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""स्थितिबाट"" (position) as ""with such a"" and ""दोषरहित"" (flawless) as ""treacherous,"" which changes the meaning of the original sentence.
3. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of the source text by translating ""स्थितिबाट"" as ""from such a"" and ""दोषरहित"" as ""flawless.""

|Reference translation: There is one higher secondary school , 31 secondary schools , 34 lower secondary schools and 233 primary schools in different places.|

**Analysis:**

1. **""एक उच्च माध्यमिक विद्यालय""** (One high school) - Machine translation: ""A High School"" - The reference translation uses ""higher secondary school"" which is more accurate as it refers to a specific level of education in Nepal, while ""high school"" could be interpreted more generally.
2. **""३१ माध्यमिक विद्यालय""** (31 middle schools) - Both translations are the same.
3. **""३४ निम्न माध्यमिक विद्यालय""** (34 lower secondary schools) - Machine translation: ""34 following middle school"" - The machine translation is incorrect, as ""निम्न माध्यमिक"" (lower secondary) is not translated accurately. ""Following middle school"" does not convey the same meaning in Nepali context.
4. **""२३३ प्राथमिक विद्यालय""** (233 primary schools) - Both translations are the same.

**Overall differences:**

- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""निम्न माध्यमिक"" as ""following middle school"" instead of ""lower secondary school.""
- The machine translation omits the word ""विभिन्न स्थानमा"" (in different places) from the sentence, which is important for context.

To improve the quality, the machine translation should be revised to: ""There is one higher secondary school, 31 secondary schools, 34 lower secondary schools, and 233 primary schools located in different places.""

Step 2: Read the machine translation
Machine translation: Those who are in the four hands don't seem clear.

Step 3: Read the reference translation
Reference translation: What is in the other four hands cannot be seen clearly.

Step 4: Compare the source text with the machine translation
- The source text talks about ""कुराहरू"" (plural of ""कुरा"" which means ""things"" or ""objects"") that are in the ""चारवटा हातहरूमा"" (four hands).
- The machine translation translates ""कुराहरू"" as ""Those who are"" and ""स्पष्ट देखिँदैन्"" (clearly see) as ""don't seem clear.""

Step 5: Compare the source text with the reference translation
- The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of the source text by asking a question about what cannot be seen clearly in the other four hands.
- The machine translation, on the other hand, incorrectly translates the subject and the verb, making it sound like the objects in the four hands are unclear, rather than the act of seeing them.

Conclusion: The machine translation is different from the reference translation in its interpretation of the subject and the verb, as well as the overall meaning. The reference translation more accurately conveys the idea that the objects in the four hands are not visible clearly.

Step 1: Identify the key phrases and words in the source text.
- संस्कृतिकर्मी (culturalist)
- शान्तकृष्ण श्रेष्ठका (Shantakrishna Shrestha)
- भिमेश्वरको दर्शन (worshipping Bhimeshwor)

- Reference translation: ""According to Shantakrishna Shrestha, culturalist, worshipping at Pashupatinatha is considered incomplete without worshipping Bhimeshwor.""

Differences:
1. The machine translation refers to a ""cultural activist calmer"" instead of ""Shantakrishna Shrestha.""
2. The machine translation mentions ""the vision of the beast"" and ""the vision of the vimes,"" which are not present in the source text. It seems to have misinterpreted the context, possibly conflating the two deities.
3. The machine translation says ""unpredictable,"" which does not match the meaning of ""incomplete"" in the source text.

Conclusion:
The machine translation has significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the identification of the cultural figure (Shantakrishna Shrestha vs. a calmer) and the interpretation of the concept (incompleteness vs. unpredictability). The translation should be revised to accurately convey the meaning of the source text, which is about the importance of worshipping Bhimeshwor in the context of Pashupatinatha worship according to Shantakrishna Shrestha.

2. **Machine translation**: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""तारीख"" (date) as ""preparations"" and ""तशरीकका दिन"" (days of Tasharik) as ""celebrated on 11 to 13 may"". This implies that the machine is interpreting the dates as a time for preparation rather than a specific event.

3. **Reference translation**: The reference translation correctly captures the meaning, stating that the ""last three days"" are called ""the days of Tasharik"" and specifying the date range from ""11 to 13"" for Jilhij.

4. **Accuracy**: The machine translation is not accurate in terms of conveying the event and the relationship between the dates and the event.

5. **Fluency**: The machine translation is fluent in terms of English grammar, but the meaning is off.

|Reference translation: After being promoted to position of major in 1988, General Rodrigej Ochao who is in higher position started liking Chavez and was appointed as his assistant at Carcus.|

|Analysis|
1. **Timeframe**: The source mentions ""सन् १९८८मा"" (in 1988), while the machine translation incorrectly states ""growing up in a major post in 1988"" which implies a childhood or early career event, not a promotion. The reference translation correctly uses ""being promoted to position of major in 1988.""
2. **Position**: The source refers to ""उच्च पदमा"" (higher position), which is not directly translated in the machine translation, which instead says ""a highly regarded junior."" The reference translation correctly translates this as ""who is in higher position.""
3. **Person's reaction**: The source states ""चाभेजलाई मन पराउन थाले"" (started liking), while the machine translation uses ""began to favor."" Both convey a similar meaning, but the source is more direct. The reference translation also uses ""started liking.""
4. **Appointment**: The source mentions ""काराकसमा"" (at Caracus) and ""नियुक्त गरे"" (appointed), while the machine translation omits the location and uses ""appointed as his assistant at caracus"" without specifying the location. The reference translation includes the location, ""at Carcus.""

Step 1: Identify the main components of the source text
- Subject: डाँडी गीतमा (Dandi song)
- Action: वाक्क दिक्क भएर (waking up)
- Result: झुमरी गीतको नाच आरम्भ गर्ने (beginning the dance of Jhumari song)
- Effect: फेरी तरङ्गित हुन थाल्छन् (get excited)

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation
- Machine translation: The waking in the mountain song is waved again as they initiate the dance of the bhumari song.
- Reference translation: Those fed up with Dandi song get excited immediately after beginning the dance of Jhumari song.

Step 3: Analyze the differences
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""डाँडी गीतमा"" (Dandi song) as ""mountain song"" (bhumari song), which is not accurate.
- The machine translation also uses ""waved again"" (फेरी तरङ्गित हुन थाल्छन्), which is a metaphorical expression in the source, but the reference translation directly translates it to ""get excited.""
- The machine translation does not capture the concept of ""fed up"" (झुमरी गीतको नाच आरम्भ गर्ने), which is a key part of the source's meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation significantly differs from the reference translation in terms of accuracy, specifically in identifying the Dandi song and the emotional state of the listeners. The metaphorical expression in the source is also not translated appropriately.

2. The machine translation uses ""starakshur"" instead of ""ताराकसुर"" (Tarakshur), which is a proper noun and might not be accurately translated by the machine. The reference translation keeps the original Nepali term.
3. Similarly, ""dhupre"" in the machine translation is likely a mistranslation of ""खपरे"" (Khapare), another proper noun. The reference translation uses the correct term.
4. The machine translation includes ""Dadhimast"" without context, while the reference translation specifies it as ""दाड़ेमष्ट"" (Dademasht), which is more accurate.
