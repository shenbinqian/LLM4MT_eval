  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""W. P."" (instead of ""B. P."")
	* Reference translation: ""B. P."" (correct)
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""who obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council after a satellite run of 26 and 27."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""who obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council after a Satyagrah run of 26 and 27."" (correct)
	* Explanation: The machine translation uses the phrase ""satellite run"" instead of ""Satyagrah run"", which is the correct term in Nepali.
3. Punctuation:
	* Machine translation: ""W. P., chairman of the Nepali Congress, who obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council after a satellite run of 26 and 27."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""B. P., the chairman of the Nepali Congress, who obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council after a Satyagrah run of 26 and 27."" (correct)
	* Explanation: The machine translation lacks punctuation at the end of the sentence, which makes it difficult to understand the sentence structure.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""after a satellite run of 26 and 27"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""after a Satyagrah run of 26 and 27"" (correct)
	* Explanation: The machine translation reverses the word order in the sentence, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""obtained a permit to complete demands"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council"" (correct)
	* Explanation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""from the royal council"" in the reference translation.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not of high quality. The reference translation provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the original Nepali text. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further translation work.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the word order is different from the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""from later investigations"" is placed at the end of the sentence, whereas in the reference translation, it is placed before the verb ""is obtained"".
2. Use of ""later"" vs. ""from later investigations"": The machine translation uses the word ""later"" to indicate the time period, while the reference translation uses ""from later investigations"". The reference translation is more accurate as it specifically mentions the source of the information, which is important in this context.
3. Tense agreement: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is obtained"" to indicate the current state of the information, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""was born"" to indicate the time of birth. The reference translation is more accurate as it matches the tense of the verb ""obtained"" with the time of birth.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""South India"" instead of ""Dakshin Bhārat"" which is the more commonly used term in Nepali. While both terms refer to the same region, the use of ""South India"" may not be as accurate or familiar to Nepali speakers.
5. Punctuation: The machine translation lacks punctuation, which can make the sentence harder to read and understand. The reference translation includes punctuation, which makes it easier to read and understand.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation provides more context and clarity, and uses more appropriate language and punctuation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""After two weeks of that equal game""
	* Reference translation: ""Two weeks after that draw""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""after two weeks of that equal game"" to indicate the time period, while the reference translation uses ""two weeks after that draw"" to be more specific and accurate.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""they were rebounded between them""
	* Reference translation: ""they played again""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb ""rebound"" which is not a common English verb, while the reference translation uses the more common verb ""played"" to indicate that they played the game again.
3. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""but the game ended as before.""
	* Reference translation: ""but the game ended in a draw like the previous game.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure with a subordinate clause, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a more direct comparison.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: "" equal game""
	* Reference translation: ""draw""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""equal game"" which is not a common English idiom, while the reference translation uses the more common idiom ""draw"" to indicate a tie.
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The translation seems a bit stilted and unnatural, with awkward phrasing and word choice.
	* Reference translation: The translation is more fluent and natural-sounding, with better phrasing and word choice.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate, natural-sounding, and idiomatic than the machine translation. The machine translation seems to struggle with word choice, grammar, and sentence structure, which can make the translation sound awkward and unnatural.

  As a helpful assistant, I will evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation of the given source. Here's my analysis step by step:

1. Source: सङ्घीयताको आधुनिक अवधारणा संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिकामा सन् १७७६ देखि १७८९ बीचमा भएको मानिन्छ.
Machine Translation: The modern concept of federalism is considered to have been between 1776 and 1789 in the United States.
Reference Translation: The modern concept of federalism is considered to have originated in the United States between 1776 and 1789.

Difference:

* The machine translation uses the phrase ""between 1776 and 1789"" to indicate the time period, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""originated in the United States between 1776 and 1789.""
* The machine translation does not explicitly mention the country of origin, while the reference translation does so.

2. Analysis:

The machine translation does not provide a clear indication of the time period in which the modern concept of federalism originated in the United States. It simply states that it was between 1776 and 1789, without providing any context or clarity. In contrast, the reference translation provides a clear and concise explanation of the time period in which the concept originated, and also mentions the country of origin.

3. Quality evaluation:

Based on the above analysis, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as low, as it does not provide a clear and concise explanation of the time period in which the modern concept of federalism originated in the United States. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a clear and concise explanation of the time period and also mentions the country of origin, making it a higher quality translation.

In conclusion, the reference translation is a higher quality translation than the machine translation because it provides a clear and concise explanation of the time period in which the modern concept of federalism originated in the United States, and also mentions the country of origin. The machine translation, on the other hand, does not provide a clear indication of the time period and does not explicitly mention the country of origin, making it a lower quality translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""working investment"" instead of ""non-commercial taxable assets"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly. In the context of the sentence, ""working investment"" could imply that the non-commercial taxable assets are being used for business purposes, which may not be the intended meaning.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""will be considered"") in the second sentence, while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense (""will be considered""). This difference in verb tense may not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence, but it can affect the overall flow and readability of the translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""keeping non-commercial taxable assets"" to convey the idea of holding onto these assets. The machine translation does not use this idiomatic expression, instead using the more literal translation ""nonprofit taxable assets will be considered a working investment."" While both translations are grammatically correct, the idiomatic expression in the reference translation may be more natural and easier to understand for a Nepali speaker.
4. Cultural nuances: The reference translation uses the phrase ""non-commercial taxable assets"" to convey the idea of assets that are not used for business purposes. This phrase may be more culturally appropriate in Nepal, where the concept of non-commercial assets may be more clearly defined and understood. The machine translation does not take this cultural nuance into account, using a more general term that may not be as accurate or culturally appropriate.

Overall, while both translations are grammatically correct, the reference translation is more idiomatic and culturally appropriate for a Nepali audience. The machine translation, on the other hand, may be more suitable for a general English-speaking audience.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""surgically"" to describe the movement of Nori bombs, while the reference translation uses ""started shaking"" to describe the movement of Dudhkuwa.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the past tense ""costs"" to describe the movement of Nori bombs, while the reference translation uses the present tense ""started shaking"" to describe the movement of Dudhkuwa.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""what moves Nori bombs"" to describe the movement of the bombs, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""what is happening"" to describe the situation.
4. Names: The machine translation uses the name ""Nori"" for the king, while the reference translation uses the name ""Naari Bam"" for the king.
5. Tone: The machine translation has a more formal tone, while the reference translation has a more conversational tone.
6. Cultural references: The machine translation does not include any cultural references, while the reference translation includes a cultural reference to the king's order.
7. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, placing ""what moves Nori bombs"" after ""costs"", while the reference translation keeps the original word order.
8. Phrasing: The machine translation uses the phrase ""after bringing a search"" to describe the action of searching for Naari Bam, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""when asked to search and bring"" to describe the action.
9. Verb tenses: The machine translation uses the past tense ""brought"" to describe the action of bringing Naari Bam, while the reference translation uses the present tense ""bring"" to describe the action.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have significant differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, names, tone, cultural references, word order, phrasing, and verb tenses. The reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding, while the machine translation is more formal and lacks cultural context.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation:

* ""From there onwards"" is not a correct English phrase. It should be ""From then on"" or ""From that point onwards.""
* ""he took the post"" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased as ""he was appointed to the post"" or ""he assumed the position of Minister.""
* ""Minister"" is not capitalized in the machine translation, which is incorrect. In English, proper nouns are always capitalized.

Reference Translation:

* The sentence structure is more straightforward and natural in the reference translation.
* ""Upon his return"" is a more idiomatic way of expressing the idea of someone taking up a new position after a period of time.
* ""Minister"" is correctly capitalized in the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation has some errors in grammar, word choice, and punctuation, while the reference translation is more idiomatic and accurate. Based on these differences, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""Murmys"" instead of ""Murmi"" in the reference translation. This is a common error in machine translation, as it often struggles to recognize and translate proper nouns correctly.
2. Tense agreement: The machine translation uses the present tense ""consider"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""considered"" in the first instance and the present tense ""consider"" in the second instance. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the prepositional phrase ""of the oldest inhabitants"" after the noun ""inhabitants"" in both instances, while the reference translation places it before the noun in the first instance and after it in the second instance. This is a minor difference in word order that does not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence.
4. Punctuation: The machine translation does not use any punctuation after the name ""George Grierson"" in the first instance, while the reference translation includes a comma after the name. This is a minor difference in punctuation that does not affect the meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, tense agreement, word order, and punctuation. However, the differences are minor and do not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a rating of 60% and the reference translation a rating of 80%.

Machine Translation:

* ""A new era of mcmen was then introduced.""

Reference Translation:

* ""McMahon then ushered in a new era.""

The machine translation makes several errors in this sentence:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""mcmen"" instead of ""McMahon"". This is a clear error, as ""mcmen"" is not a recognizable word in English.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""was then introduced"") instead of the past tense (""ushered in"") to match the verb tense of the reference translation.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""of mcmen"" after ""new era"" instead of before it.

Overall, the machine translation is of poor quality and does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and natural-sounding translation of the sentence.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""sleeping couple"" (instead of ""sleeping period"")
	* Reference translation: ""sleeping period of god Vishnu"" (instead of ""sleeping couple"")

The machine translation uses the phrase ""sleeping couple"" to translate the Nepali word ""धार्मिक दृष्टिले"" (dharmiik drishtile), which means ""religious scene"" or ""religious context"". However, the reference translation uses the phrase ""sleeping period of god Vishnu"" to accurately convey the meaning of the original Nepali text.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""From a religious perspective"" (instead of ""From a religious point of view"")
	* Reference translation: No difference

The machine translation uses the phrase ""From a religious perspective"" to introduce the translation, while the reference translation uses the more common phrase ""From a religious point of view"". However, both translations are grammatically correct, and the choice between the two phrases may depend on the context and the intended meaning.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""goddesses"" (instead of ""god Vishnu"")
	* Reference translation: No difference

The machine translation uses the phrase ""goddesses"" to translate the Nepali word ""भगवान"" (bhagavan), which can also be translated as ""god Vishnu"". However, the reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Nepali text by using the phrase ""god Vishnu"".

4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: No cultural references (instead of cultural references)
	* Reference translation: Cultural references are included

The machine translation does not include any cultural references, while the reference translation includes cultural references to help the reader understand the context and meaning of the original Nepali text. For example, the reference translation includes the phrase ""god Vishnu"", which is a cultural reference that is specific to Hinduism and Nepali culture.

5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The translation may sound awkward or unnatural (instead of smooth and natural)
	* Reference translation: The translation sounds smooth and natural

The machine translation may sound awkward or unnatural due to the limitations of machine learning algorithms and the complexity of the Nepali language. In contrast, the reference translation sounds smooth and natural, as it has been written by a human translator who is familiar with the nuances of the Nepali language and culture.

In conclusion, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation includes cultural references, accurately conveys the meaning of the original Nepali text, and uses more idiomatic expressions. The machine translation, on the other hand, may sound awkward or unnatural due to its limitations and the complexity of the Nepali language.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""But exceptionally funny"" is not grammatically correct in Nepali. The correct phrase would be ""तर अत्यन्तै रमाइलो"" (tar atyantai ramailo).
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the correct grammatical structure of Nepali, using ""तथा"" (tatha) to connect the two clauses.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses some uncommon words like ""Hinnabod"" and ""Gariev"" which are not commonly used in Nepali.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses more common and idiomatic Nepali words, such as ""पीडा"" (pida) and ""कहिलेकाहीं"" (kahilekahi) to convey the same meaning.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the nuances of some idiomatic expressions in Nepali, such as ""हिनताबोध"" (hinnatabodh) which means ""inferiority complex"" in Nepali.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses more appropriate idioms and expressions, such as ""सन्सारको अन्याय"" (sansarako anyay) to convey the idea of ""worldly injustice"".
4. Tone and style:

1. Machine translation: ""The eight types of genealogical powers were in molecular, glory, poverty, lagging, receiving, publishing, hinting, and virtue of her.""

The machine translation uses the word ""molecular"" which is not a common term in Nepali language. In Nepali, the word for ""genealogical powers"" is ""yogik shakti"" or ""yogik kriya"" and not ""genealogical powers in molecular"".

2. Machine translation: ""anima , mahima , garima , lagima , prapti , prakmya , ishityo and basityo""

The machine translation uses the word ""anima"" which is not a correct translation of the Nepali word ""एनिमा"" (anima). The correct translation of ""एनिमा"" is ""anima"" or ""inner self"". Similarly, the machine translation uses ""mahima"" instead of ""महिमा"" (mahima), ""garima"" instead of ""गरिमा"" (garima), ""lagima"" instead of ""लघिमा"" (lagima), ""prapti"" instead of ""प्राप्ति"" (prapti), ""prakmya"" instead of ""प्रकाम्य"" (prakamy), ""ishityo"" instead of ""इशित्व"" (ishitva), and ""basityo"" instead of ""वशित्व"" (vasitva).

3. Machine translation: ""He had""

The machine translation uses the word ""He had"" which is not a correct translation of the Nepali sentence structure. In Nepali, the sentence should be ""उनमा थिए"" (unma thiye) which means ""They had"".

Based on the above analysis, it is clear that the machine translation is not accurate in translating the Nepali sentence into English. The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the original Nepali sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation: ""Specifically from the department if employed, and from the office if employed.""

Reference Translation: ""From office if employee and from department if non-gazetted employee.""

The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are:

1. Use of ""if employed"" in the machine translation is missing in the reference translation. The reference translation uses ""if non-gazetted employee"" to indicate that the translation is only applicable to non-gazetted employees.
2. The machine translation uses the phrase ""from the department"" twice, while the reference translation uses it only once.
3. The machine translation uses the phrase ""if employed"" twice, while the reference translation uses it only once.
4. The machine translation uses the word ""specifically"" which is not present in the reference translation.
5. The machine translation uses the word ""office"" which is not present in the reference translation.

Based on these differences, it can be concluded that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in this case. The reference translation provides more context and clarity, especially in the case of non-gazetted employees.

Overall, the machine translation seems to be lacking in accuracy and clarity compared to the reference translation. It's important to use high-quality reference translations as a basis for machine translation to ensure that the resulting translation is accurate and natural-sounding.

Machine Translation: ""In 2006 of which iob left the Nelson Mandela fund.""

Reference Translation: ""In 2006, Ayob left the Nelson Mandela Fund.""

Here are the differences I found between the two translations:

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the word order is different. The word ""of"" is placed before ""which,"" whereas in the reference translation, it is placed after ""which.""
2. Use of ""iob"" vs. ""Ayob"": The machine translation uses the word ""iob,"" which is not a commonly used term in Nepali. In the reference translation, the name ""Ayob"" is used, which is the correct spelling for the name.
3. Use of ""fund"" vs. ""Fund"": The machine translation uses the singular form ""fund"" instead of the plural form ""Fund"" in the reference translation.
4. Punctuation: The machine translation lacks punctuation at the end of the sentence, whereas the reference translation includes a period.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has introduced errors in the word order, the use of uncommon terms, and the punctuation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""सङ्घीय"" (sanghīya) is translated as ""structure"" instead of ""federal structure"".
	* Reference translation: ""federal structure"" is used consistently throughout the translation.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The verb tense is inconsistent, with ""has"" in the first sentence being in the present tense, while ""run"" in the second sentence is in the past tense.
	* Reference translation: The verb tense is consistent throughout the translation, using the present tense for both ""has"" and ""run"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""इकाइहरूलाई"" (ikā'iharūlā'i) is translated as ""units"" instead of ""local governments"".
	* Reference translation: ""local governments"" is used consistently throughout the translation.
4. Word order:

Machine Translation: Office on policy and circumstances not to integrate or divide the base

* ""Office"" is translated as ""Office"" in both the source and the machine translation, which is correct.
* ""नीति"" (Niti) is translated as ""policy"" in the machine translation, which is also correct.
* ""तथा"" (tatha) is translated as ""and"" in the machine translation, which is also correct.
* ""परिपत्र"" (Paripatra) is translated as ""circumstances"" in the machine translation, which is a bit awkward and not entirely accurate. In Nepali, ""परिपत्र"" can also mean ""documents"" or ""letters,"" so it would be more accurate to translate it as ""documents"" or ""letters"" instead of ""circumstances.""
* ""समेतका"" (sametaka) is translated as ""not"" in the machine translation, which is correct.
* ""आधारमा"" (adharma) is translated as ""on the basis of"" in the machine translation, which is also correct.
* ""एकिकरण"" (ekikaran) is translated as ""integration"" in the machine translation, which is correct.
* ""वा"" (va) is a particle that is often translated as ""or"" in Nepali, but it is not necessary in this context, so it would be better to omit it in the translation.
* ""विभाजन"" (vibhajan) is translated as ""divide"" in the machine translation, which is also correct.

Reference Translation: Office in relation to unification or division on the basis of policy and circulars etc.

* ""Office"" is translated as ""Office"" in both the source and the reference translation, which is correct.
* ""नीति"" (Niti) is translated as ""policy"" in the reference translation, which is also correct.
* ""तथा"" (tatha) is translated as ""and"" in the reference translation, which is also correct.
* ""परिपत्र"" (Paripatra) is translated as ""documents"" or ""letters"" in the reference translation, which is more accurate than the machine translation.

* ""विभाजन"" (vibhajan) is translated as ""division"" in the reference translation, which is also correct.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in this case. The machine translation uses more formal language and does not capture the nuances of the Nepali language as well as the reference translation does. However, it is important to note that machine translation is a complex task and can be improved with better algorithms and training data, so it is possible that the machine translation could be improved in the future.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""In France, very early nineteenth century rule was run."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""France had a long history of autocracy rule."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense, which is ""was run"" instead of ""had"". The correct verb tense should be ""had"" to match the past tense of the sentence.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""nineteenth century"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""autocracy rule"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the term ""nineteenth century"", which is not the correct term for the type of government mentioned in the source text. The reference translation uses the term ""autocracy rule"" which is more accurate.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""फ्रान्समा धेरै पहिलेदेखि निरंकुस शासन चलेको थियो"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""France had a long history of autocracy rule."" (correct)

The machine translation uses a Nepali idiomatic expression ""धेरै पहिलेदेखि"" which is not commonly used in English. The reference translation uses a more idiomatic English expression ""had a long history of autocracy rule"".

4. Sentence structure:

3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""started"" to translate ""लगत"" (lagat), which means ""begun"" or ""started"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
4. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, which can make it harder to understand. The reference translation maintains the original word order, which makes it easier to read and understand.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't quite capture the idiomatic expression ""निज सरुवा"" (nij saruva), which means ""when she / he is transferred or promoted"". This is a common problem in machine translation, as idiomatic expressions can be difficult to translate accurately.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions. While the machine translation is understandable, it lacks the nuance and precision of a human translation. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable option.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""fruit of the gods"" multiple times, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""fruits which they had offered him."" This suggests that the machine translation may not have accurately captured the nuance of the original Nepali sentence.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""eaten"" in the third person singular form, while the reference translation uses the verb ""ate"" in the third person plural form. This may indicate that the machine translation is not fully understanding the grammatical structure of the Nepali sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""fruit of the gods,"" which is not a common idiomatic expression in Nepali. The reference translation uses the more common phrase ""fruits which they had offered him."" This suggests that the machine translation may not have fully captured the cultural and linguistic context of the original sentence.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""of the gods"" are placed after the verb ""eaten,"" while in the reference translation, they are placed before the verb. This may indicate that the machine translation is not fully understanding the word order and syntax of Nepali.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation appears to be less accurate than the reference translation in terms of capturing the meaning and nuance of the original sentence. The reference translation more closely matches the original Nepali sentence, while the machine translation introduces errors and inaccuracies.

Overall, it seems that the machine translation is not fully accurate or nuanced in its translation of the Nepali sentence. The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation of the original sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""sorcery"" and ""order"" are placed after the verb ""is written,"" whereas in the reference translation, they are placed before the verb ""write."" This difference in word order can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as it changes the emphasis on the action of writing.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is written"") to describe the action of writing, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""write""). This difference in tense can also affect the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the action of writing is ongoing in the machine translation, while it is completed in the reference translation.
3. Prepositions: The machine translation uses the preposition ""after"" to indicate the timing of the action of writing, while the reference translation uses the preposition ""during."" This difference in prepositions can also affect the meaning of the sentence, as ""after"" implies a specific time after the action of writing, while ""during"" implies that the action of writing occurred simultaneously with another action.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""sorcery"" to refer to the research, while the reference translation uses the word ""research."" This difference in word choice can affect the meaning of the sentence, as ""sorcery"" has a different connotation than ""research.""
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence is structured as a compound sentence with two independent clauses, while in the reference translation, it is structured as a simple sentence with a single independent clause. This difference in grammatical structure can affect the clarity and readability of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word order, tense, prepositions, word choice, and grammar. These differences can affect the meaning and clarity of the sentence, and may indicate that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""Under"" in the first sentence, while the reference translation uses ""About."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in both sentences, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the second sentence. This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame of the information being conveyed.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the adjective ""Asian"" after the noun ""rice,"" while the reference translation places it before the noun. This is a minor difference in word order, but it can affect the emphasis and clarity of the sentence.
4. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a longer phrase structure in the second sentence, with ""approximately 90 percent of the world's rice is produced and consumed in Asia itself."" The reference translation uses a simpler phrase structure, with ""about 90 percent of the world's rice is produced and consumed in Asia."" This difference in phrase structure can affect the clarity and readability of the sentence.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""in the world"" in both sentences, while the reference translation uses the more literal phrase ""in Asia."" This difference in idiomatic expressions can affect the naturalness and fluency of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, grammar, word order, phrase structure, and idiomatic expressions. While the machine translation is generally understandable, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb tense ""took"" in the past tense, while the reference translation uses the verb tense ""came"" in the past tense.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""केही सांसदहरूले"" (Some Representatives)
	* Reference translation: ""some lawmakers""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""सांसदहरू"" (Representatives) which is the Nepali word for ""representatives"", while the reference translation uses the English word ""lawmakers"".
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""एउटा रोगको कारण बताई"" (took the name of the drug used in the treatment of another disease as a reason for a disease)

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""deoda"" to translate ""देउडा"" (Deuda), while the reference translation uses ""Deuda"". This is a minor difference, but it's important to note that the machine translation uses a more informal and colloquial term, while the reference translation uses a more formal and standard term.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is known"") in the first sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was known""). This is a more accurate translation, as the original Nepali sentence is in the past tense.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the original sentence, placing ""it"" before ""name"". In the reference translation, the word order is closer to the original Nepali sentence.
4. Phrasing: The machine translation uses the phrase ""by the name"" instead of ""as the name"", which is a more accurate translation of the original Nepali phrase.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation uses the term ""song"" to translate ""गीत"" (Gita), which is a more general term that could refer to any type of music. The reference translation uses the more specific term ""devotional song"" to translate ""संस्कृती"" (Sanskriti), which is a more accurate translation of the original Nepali term.
6. Language usage: The machine translation uses the term ""language"" to translate ""भाषा"" (Bhasha), which is a more general term that could refer to any language. The reference translation uses the more specific term ""Nepali"" to translate ""भाषा"" (Bhasha), which is a more accurate translation of the original Nepali term.
7. Grammar errors: The machine translation contains a grammatical error in the last sentence, where it uses the singular form of the verb ""to play"" instead of the plural form.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The machine translation makes some minor errors in word choice and grammar, and it also uses more informal language in some places. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more reliable and accurate translation of the original Nepali sentence.

Machine Translation:

* ""And I will make the city steadfast by the way which I have done.""

Reference Translation:

* ""I will make the city stable from the virtue which I have done.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""steadfast"" instead of ""stable"". While ""steadfast"" can also mean stable, it has a slightly different connotation, implying a more permanent or unwavering quality. In contrast, ""stable"" is a more straightforward translation of the Nepali word ""स्थिर"".
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""will make"" instead of the past tense ""made"" in the reference translation. This is a common difference between machine and human translations, as machines often struggle to accurately convey the nuances of verb tenses and moods.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""from the virtue"" to convey the idea of the speaker's actions being the source of the city's stability. The machine translation does not capture this idiomatic expression, instead using a more literal translation of the Nepali phrase.
4. Fluency: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation, with the phrase ""by the way which I have done"" feeling a bit awkward and unnatural in English. The reference translation, on the other hand, has a more natural and fluid structure.

Overall, while the machine translation is grammatically correct, it lacks the nuance and natural flow of the reference translation. The reference translation is a better representation of the original Nepali sentence, capturing the idiomatic expressions and conveying the intended meaning more accurately.

1. Machine translation: ""Don't hold down anything, including cuts, evils and altruism, and her idealism.""

The machine translation seems to have struggled with the nuances of the original Nepali sentence. Here are some of the differences I noticed:

* ""Don't hold down anything"" is not a direct translation of the Nepali phrase ""कटु र नराम्रा र वेदनादायी कुराहरूलाई समेत कत्ति पनि तलमाथि नपारी र तिनको आदर्शीकरण"" which means ""Don't hurt or harm anyone, including cuts, evils, and altruism, and her idealism.""
* The word ""cuts"" is not a good translation of the Nepali word ""नराम्रा"" which can also mean ""evils"" or ""bad things.""
* The word ""altruism"" is not a direct translation of the Nepali word ""वेदनादायी"" which can also mean ""selflessness"" or ""unselfishness.""
* The phrase ""and her idealism"" is not a direct translation of the Nepali phrase ""तिनको आदर्शीकरण"" which means ""and her idolization.""
2. Reference translation: ""Hurtful , bad , and malified matters too without altering them and idolizing their.""

The reference translation seems to have done a better job of capturing the nuances of the original Nepali sentence. Here are some of the improvements I noticed:

* The word ""hurtful"" is a better translation of the Nepali word ""नराम्रा"" which can also mean ""evils"" or ""bad things.""
* The word ""bad"" is a good translation of the Nepali word ""बाद"" which can also mean ""evil"" or ""wrong.""

2. Article usage: In the machine translation, the word ""the"" is used before ""Dolpa region,"" while in the reference translation, no article is used. This is because in Nepali, the use of articles depends on the context and the speaker's preference, and in this case, the reference translation has chosen to omit the article to make the sentence more natural-sounding.
3. Adjective placement: In the machine translation, the adjective ""wealthy"" is placed after the noun ""hill,"" while in the reference translation, it is placed before the noun. This is another common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations may not always place adjectives in the correct position.
4. Word choice: In the machine translation, the word ""tibetans"" is used, while in the reference translation, the word ""Tibetans"" is used. This is a minor difference, but it highlights the importance of using the correct form of a word in a translation.
5. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include any punctuation at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation includes a period. This is a difference in punctuation style between the two translations, and it does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation maintains the original word order, uses the correct article usage, and places adjectives in the correct position. Additionally, it uses the correct form of the word ""Tibetans"" and includes punctuation at the end of the sentence. In contrast, the machine translation has some errors in word order, article usage, and adjective placement, and it does not include punctuation at the end of the sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Several weapons and carriages were collected"" (MT) vs. ""Hundreds of weapons and millions of rupees were collected"" (Ref)
	* The machine translation uses the word ""several"" to indicate a small number of weapons, while the reference translation uses ""hundreds"" to indicate a larger number.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""but the Darwin County Knight Thirvam Malla received shahadat"" (MT) vs. ""but unfortunately the revolutionary warrior Thiravam Malla was martyred"" (Ref)
	* The machine translation uses the word ""but"" to connect the previous sentence to the next one, while the reference translation uses ""but"" to indicate a contrast or contradiction.
3. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Darwin County Knight"" (MT) vs. ""revolutionary warrior"" (Ref)
	* The machine translation uses the term ""Darwin County Knight,"" which is not a common term in Nepali. The reference translation uses the term ""revolutionary warrior,"" which is more appropriate in this context.
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Thirvam Malla received shahadat"" (MT) vs. ""Thiravam Malla was martyred"" (Ref)
	* The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with a subordinate clause.
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""shahadat"" (MT) vs. ""martyred"" (Ref)
	* The machine translation uses the term ""shahadat,"" which is not a commonly used term in Nepali. The reference translation uses the term ""martyred,"" which is more idiomatic and appropriate in this context.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, vocabulary, sentence structure, and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation provides a more natural and idiomatic rendering of the Nepali text, making it easier to understand for a native English speaker.

	* Reference translation: ""Gautam Gotri Chhetriyas"" - This term is not commonly used in English, and it seems to be a Nepali term that refers to a specific group of people. A more appropriate term would be ""Brahmins"".
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""was enough to develop socialism"" - This phrase is not commonly used in English, and it seems to be a Nepali idiom. A more appropriate phrase would be ""provided ample opportunity for social development"".
4. Cultural references:

1. Focus: The machine translation uses the phrase ""with a focus"" to convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence, while the reference translation uses ""with research work in mind."" The reference translation provides a more accurate and nuanced translation of the original Nepali phrase, which emphasizes the idea that the works were written with a specific research purpose in mind.
2. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""surviving"" instead of ""written"" in the original Nepali sentence. While ""surviving"" can be a valid translation of the Nepali word ""लेखिएका,"" it doesn't quite convey the same meaning as ""written."" The reference translation correctly translates the Nepali word as ""written.""
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are written"") to translate the Nepali sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""were written""). The reference translation's use of the past tense is more appropriate, as it matches the tense of the original Nepali sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't quite capture the idiomatic expression used in the original Nepali sentence. The reference translation's translation of ""यी शोध कार्यलाई"" as ""research work in mind"" is more idiomatic and conveys the same meaning as the original Nepali phrase.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""racialized"" is not a commonly used word in Nepali, and it doesn't quite convey the same meaning as the original Nepali word ""राधादी"" (Radha-di). In Nepali, ""Radha"" refers to a woman's name, and ""gopini"" means ""cowherd"". So, the machine translation should have used more appropriate words to convey the meaning of the original sentence.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the word ""quarreled"" which is a more appropriate word to use in this context.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the verb ""there was"" in the past tense, which is not necessary in Nepali. In Nepali, the verb ""थिए"" (thiye) is used to indicate a past action that has already happened.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the verb ""annoyed"" which is a more appropriate word to use in this context.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation doesn't quite capture the idiomatic expression ""राखेर दिक्क पारेका थिए"" (raakhera dikka parake thiye) which means ""he used to make unreasonable demands"". In Nepali, ""raakhera"" means ""unreasonable"" and ""dikka"" means ""demand"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the phrase ""unreasonable demands"" which is a more accurate translation of the idiomatic expression in Nepali.
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the reference translation. In Nepali, the sentence structure is generally simpler and more straightforward.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence better, and the language used is more natural and fluent.

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""is referred to"" in the first sentence, while the reference translation uses ""is referred as."" The reference translation is more accurate in this regard, as ""is referred to"" is not a common or idiomatic way to express this idea in English.
3. Idioms and expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""a variant of worshiping the twins,"" while the reference translation uses ""it is customary for a person born in this constellation to worship the twin tree."" The reference translation is more accurate in this regard, as ""worship the twins"" is not a common or idiomatic way to express the idea of worshiping the twin tree in English.
4. Tone and style: The machine translation has a more informal and conversational tone, while the reference translation is more formal and academic.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""tirtha"" to refer to ""Panchkoshi,"" which is a Sanskrit word meaning ""pilgrimage site."" In contrast, the reference translation uses the word ""pilgrimage site"" directly. This difference in word choice may not have a significant impact on the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does show that the reference translation is more direct and straightforward in its translation.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""is"" to indicate that the festival is held with attention importance. In contrast, the reference translation uses the verb ""considered"" to convey the same meaning. This difference in verb choice may not have a significant impact on the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does show that the reference translation is more precise in its grammar.
3. Word order: The machine translation places the word ""this"" at the beginning of the sentence, which can make the sentence sound a bit awkward. In contrast, the reference translation places the word ""festival"" before the word ""is"" to create a more natural word order.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""attention importance"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses the phrase ""special significance"" which is a more common and idiomatic expression in Nepali.
5. Cultural context: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the sentence, which is a pilgrimage site. In contrast, the reference translation includes this cultural context, which is important for conveying the meaning of the sentence.

2. Grammar: The machine translation has more grammatical errors than the reference translation. For example, the sentence ""who lived by the fourth part of the virgin"" in the machine translation is incorrect, as ""virgin"" is not a place, but rather a noun that refers to a woman who has never been married.

3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the original Nepali sentence. For example, the phrase ""who lived by the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part of the fourth part"" in the machine translation does not have the same meaning as the original Nepali sentence, which uses a metaphorical expression to convey the idea of living in a remote or hard-to-reach place.
4. Cultural references: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the original Nepali sentence.

4. Fluency: The machine translation seems to struggle with the word order in the sentence, placing the preposition ""from"" after the verb ""wanted."" In Nepali, the word order is typically SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), so the sentence should read ""Because he wanted to know from a different point of view about the world life.""

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence better, including the idiomatic expression ""world life"" and the correct verb tense. The machine translation, on the other hand, makes some minor errors in word choice and grammar that can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Machine Translation:

* The sentence structure is not accurate. It should be ""The patriarch is typically used in the worship of Anwar and the gods."" instead of ""The patriarch is typically used in nwaran and in God 's place of worship .""
* The word ""nwaran"" is not a correct term in Nepali. The correct term is ""Nwaran"".
* The word ""God"" is not capitalized in the machine translation, which is incorrect. In Nepali, proper nouns are always capitalized.

Reference Translation:

* The sentence structure is accurate.
* The word ""धमारी"" (Dhamari) is correctly translated as ""patriarch"".
* The word ""न्वारन"" (Nwaran) is correctly translated as ""worship"".
* The word ""देवता"" (Devatā) is correctly translated as ""gods"".

Based on these differences, I would give the reference translation a higher quality score than the machine translation. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the original Nepali sentence, while the machine translation contains errors in sentence structure, word choice, and capitalization.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""tribunal"" (महासागर)
	* Reference translation: ""clan"" (कुलखान्दन)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""tribunal"" which is not the correct term in Nepali. The reference translation uses the word ""clan"" which is the correct term in Nepali.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""is required to open"" (हुनका लागि खाली प्राप्त हुनु)
	* Reference translation: ""is necessary to cover"" (आधारभूत बिषय खुल्नु आवस्यक)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb form ""open"" which is not the correct verb form in Nepali. The reference translation uses the verb form ""cover"" which is the correct verb form in Nepali.
3. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""the entire basic topic"" (पूरा आधारभूत बिषय)
	* Reference translation: ""all the basic issues"" (सबै आधारभूत बिषय)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""the entire basic topic"" which is not the correct phrase in Nepali. The reference translation uses the phrase ""all the basic issues"" which is the correct phrase in Nepali.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""to be certified"" (प्रमाणित हुनु)
	* Reference translation: ""to be recognized"" (प्रमाणित हुनु)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""to be certified"" which is not the correct phrase in Nepali. The reference translation uses the phrase ""to be recognized"" which is the correct phrase in Nepali.

Overall, the machine translation is not accurate in terms of word choice, grammar, sentence structure, and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding in Nepali. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further translation work.

Machine Translation:

* The Word is in existence as the name of the honeymoon in the philosophical era that is minimal.

Reference Translation:

* The word Gautam is in existence as the name of the great sage Gautam in the philosophical era.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""honeymoon"" which is not a direct equivalent of the Nepali word ""गौतम"" (Gautam). In the reference translation, the word ""great sage Gautam"" is used, which is a more accurate translation of the Nepali word.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is minimal"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was in existence""). This difference in tense may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the past tense suggests that the name Gautam has already been in existence for some time, while the present tense could imply that the name is still in use.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""in the philosophical era"" after ""The Word"". In the reference translation, the word order is maintained, with ""in the philosophical era"" appearing before ""The Word"".
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""that is minimal"", which is not a common idiomatic expression in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses a more idiomatic expression, ""in the philosophical era"".

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, tense, word order, and idiomatic expressions. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""In May 2007"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed after the verb ""hosted.""
2. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""House of Blues,"" while the reference translation does not use any article.
3. Title capitalization: The machine translation capitalizes the title ""M + M's Tour"", while the reference translation does not capitalize it.
4. Punctuation: The machine translation uses a comma after ""Britney"" to separate the name from the verb ""hosted,"" while the reference translation does not use a comma.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""titled"" to indicate that the event was given a name, while the reference translation uses the word ""entitled.""
6. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present perfect tense (""has hosted"") to indicate that the event took place in the past, while the reference translation uses the past simple tense (""hosted"").
7. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""rallies"" to refer to the event, while the reference translation does.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the original text. The machine translation has made some errors in word order, article usage, punctuation, and grammar, which can affect the overall clarity and fluency of the translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""Percy"" instead of ""Krishna"" in the source text. This is a significant difference, as the name ""Krishna"" is a proper noun and an important part of Hindu mythology.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense (""took"") to describe Krishna's action, while the reference translation uses the present tense (""sprinkled"") to describe the action. This difference in tense may not be significant in this context, but it could be important in other translations where the tense of the source text needs to be preserved.
3. Voice: The machine translation uses the active voice (""took a little water in his hand"") while the reference translation uses the passive voice (""was sprinkled on Radha's face""). This difference in voice can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the active voice can convey a sense of agency and action, while the passive voice can convey a sense of neutrality or objectivity.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""as if reciting a mantra"" in the reference translation. This expression is important in Nepali culture and can convey a sense of ritual or spiritual practice.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""killed"" to describe Krishna's action, while the reference translation uses the verb ""started playing"" to describe the action. This difference in verb choice can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""killed"" can convey a sense of finality or permanence, while ""started playing"" can convey a sense of ongoing action.
6. Cultural references: The machine translation does not include the cultural reference to ""mantra"" in the reference translation. This reference is important in Nepali culture and can convey a sense of spiritual or ritual practice.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have significant differences in terms of word choice, tense, voice, idiomatic expressions, grammar, and cultural references. These differences can affect the overall meaning and accuracy of the translation, and highlight the importance of using high-quality, culturally-sensitive translators for important texts.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""opponents"" to refer to the Buddhist followers, while the reference translation uses ""opponents of Buddhism."" This subtle difference in word choice reflects the nuanced meaning of the original Nepali phrase, which could imply a more specific or technical meaning of ""opponents"" in the context of Buddhism.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""came"" to describe the action of the Buddhist followers, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""chased."" This difference in verb tense may be due to the machine translation's inability to accurately capture the temporal nuances of the original Nepali sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""his assistants,"" which may not be the most idiomatic or natural way to translate the Nepali phrase ""उनका सहयोगीहरुलाई."" The reference translation captures the meaning of this phrase more accurately by using ""his supporters.""
4. Place names: The machine translation uses ""Lockhart"" instead of ""लखेट्तै,"" which is the correct spelling of the place name in Nepali. This error may be due to the machine translation's lack of knowledge about the geography of Nepal.
5. Sentence structure: The machine translation and the reference translation have different sentence structures. The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a compound sentence structure with a subordinate clause. This difference in sentence structure may reflect the nuances of the original Nepali sentence and the intended meaning of the translation.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation in this case. The reference translation captures the specific meaning of the original Nepali sentence more effectively, and avoids errors in word choice, grammar, and place names.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""As the communities grew, Hindu Brahmins would consider all the feasts of Hindu traditions, respectively.""
	* Reference translation: ""Since the Sanjyals are Gautam tribes , Hindu Brahmins , they observe all the festivals and rituals of the Hindu tradition .""

The machine translation uses the word ""respectively"" to indicate that the Hindu Brahmins consider each festival separately, whereas the reference translation uses the phrase ""Hindu Brahmins"" to emphasize that the Sanjyals are a part of the Hindu tradition and observe all its festivals and rituals.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""सञ्ज्यालहरू"" (Sanjyals)
	* Reference translation: ""Gautam tribes""

The machine translation uses the word ""Sanjyals,"" which is the Nepali term for the Gautam tribe, whereas the reference translation uses the phrase ""Gautam tribes"" to provide more context and clarity.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""हिन्दु परम्पराका सबै चाड पर्वहरू"" (Hindu traditions' all feasts)
	* Reference translation: ""Hindu tradition's all festivals and rituals""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""Hindu traditions' all feasts,"" which is a bit awkward and doesn't convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The reference translation uses the phrase ""Hindu tradition's all festivals and rituals"" to provide more context and clarity.

4. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: ""मान्ने गर्दछन्"" (they consider)
	* Reference translation: ""they observe""

The machine translation uses the word ""consider,"" which doesn't convey the same level of cultural nuance as the reference translation. The reference translation uses the word ""observe,"" which is more appropriate in this context as it implies a deeper level of involvement and commitment to the Hindu tradition.

Overall, the reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally nuanced translation of the original Nepali text. The machine translation, while adequate for basic understanding, lacks the level of detail and cultural context that is present in the reference translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""payment"" instead of ""refer to payment"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference translation uses a more precise word choice to convey the intended meaning.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""will not indicate"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""does not refer to""). This difference in verb tense is due to the way the machine translation engine processes the input text. However, the reference translation is more accurate in this case, as the sentence is in the past tense.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""प्राकृतिक स्रोतबापतको"" (prākritik srotabāpatako) in the reference translation. This phrase is a common idiom in Nepali that means ""natural resources."" The machine translation does not have a direct equivalent for this phrase, which can affect the overall fluency of the translation.
4. Contextual understanding: The machine translation does not seem to fully understand the context of the sentence. The reference translation captures the nuance of the sentence better, emphasizing that the term ""यस शब्दले"" (yas shabdale) does not refer to the payment of natural resources.

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation uses the word ""sanctified"" instead of ""awakened"" to translate the Nepali word ""भावले"" (bhāvale). While ""sanctified"" can mean ""set apart for a sacred purpose"" or ""made holy"", it doesn't quite convey the same nuance as ""awakened"" in this context.
* The machine translation also uses the word ""creatures"" instead of ""beings"" to translate the Nepali word ""प्राणी"" (prāṇī). While ""creatures"" can refer to any living thing, including animals and plants, ""beings"" is a more general term that can refer to any living entity, including humans.
* The machine translation also changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""all the living creatures of the world"" before ""are sanctified in our lives"". In the original Nepali sentence, the word order is different, with ""all beings in the world"" coming before ""are awakened in our sight"".

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation uses the word ""awakened"" to translate the Nepali word ""भावले"" (bhāvale), which is a more accurate and nuanced translation of the original Nepali word.

1. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""theme and shilp's perspective""
	* Reference translation: ""Avadik , Narasimha Awataar Dewaasur Sanggram , Dobhaan , Mrityunjaya etc""

The machine translation uses more general and informal language, while the reference translation uses more formal and technical language. The reference translation also uses more specific and accurate terms related to literature, such as ""epic"" and ""shilp.""

2. Grammar and sentence structure:

	* Reference translation: ""Avatik , Narasimha Awataar Dewaasur Sanggram , Dobhaan , Mrityunjaya etc are brilliant epic from subject and skill perspective.""

The machine translation uses simpler sentence structures and more informal language, while the reference translation uses more complex sentence structures and more formal language. The reference translation also uses more precise and accurate grammar, such as the use of ""are"" instead of ""is"" to indicate plural nouns.

3. Idiomatic expressions and cultural references:

1. Source Text: लोककथाहरूको अनुसार, राजा पत्रकलाई पटनाको जनक भनिन्छ (Lokkathaharoo ko anusar, Raja Patrakalai Patnako janak bhanincha)
2. Machine Translation: According to the lochs, the king's letter is called the letter of the pot. (माachine translation: लोककथाहरूको अनुसार, राजा पत्रकलाई पटनाको जनक भनिन्छ)
3. Reference Translation: According to folklore, Raja Patrak is called the king of Patna. (Reference translation: राजा पत्रकको अनुसार, पटनाको जनक भनिन्छ)

Comparison:

* The machine translation and reference translation have different wordings for the same sentence.
* The machine translation uses the phrase ""letter of the pot"" (पटनाको जनक भनिन्छ) instead of the reference translation's ""king of Patna"" (पटनाको जनक भनिन्छ).
* The machine translation uses the term ""lochs"" (लोककथाहरू), which is not a commonly used term in Nepali language. In contrast, the reference translation uses the more common term ""folklore"" (राजा पत्रक).

Quality Evaluation:

Based on the above comparison, the quality of the machine translation is relatively low. Here are some reasons why:

1. Inaccurate wording: The machine translation uses a different wording for the same sentence, which can make it difficult to understand the meaning.
2. Lack of cultural context: The machine translation uses the term ""lochs,"" which is not a commonly used term in Nepali language. This lack of cultural context can make the translation sound unnatural and awkward.
3. Incorrect terminology: The machine translation uses the term ""letter of the pot,"" which is not a correct translation of the original Nepali phrase.

Overall, the machine translation is not accurate and lacks cultural context, which can make it difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a low quality rating.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""hurt"" to describe Deuba's emotions, while the reference translation uses ""rush."" While both words can convey a sense of urgency, ""rush"" is a more common and natural way to express this idea in English.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the incorrect grammar structure in the sentence ""the oath of posts came to call for warships."" In English, the correct sentence would be ""the oath of office came to call for a ceasefire and talks.""
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""take the oath of posts,"" which is not a common or natural way to express the idea of taking an oath of office in English. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic expression ""take the oath of office.""
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""oath of posts"" before ""came to call."" In English, the correct word order is ""came to call for the oath of office.""
5. Accuracy: The machine translation gets the meaning of the sentence correct, but the wording is not accurate. The reference translation uses more formal and precise language to convey the idea of Deuba's actions.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation is more formal and precise, and better conveys the meaning of the original Nepali sentence.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the machine translation for the given source text. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""In the area of the north, there was a shepherd of the hills, saying that there was something that was started."" - The sentence structure is correct, but the use of ""was"" instead of ""were"" to agree with the plural noun ""hills"" is incorrect.
	* Reference translation: ""In the northern region, the people of the hills had already started settling somewhere called Goth Gotheri."" - The sentence structure is correct, and the use of ""had already started"" is more appropriate than ""was started"" to indicate a completed action.
2. Vocabulary and terminology:
	* Machine translation: ""Goth Gotheri"" - The term ""Goth Gotheri"" is not a recognized Nepali term, and it seems to be a mistake or a misinterpretation of the original term.
	* Reference translation: ""somewhere called Goth Gotheri"" - The reference translation uses the correct term ""Goth Gotheri,"" which is a well-known place in Nepal.
3. Idiomatic expressions and cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""saying that there was something that was started"" - The phrase ""something that was started"" is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali, and it doesn't convey the same meaning as the original phrase ""Goth Gotheri.""
	* Reference translation: ""had already started settling"" - The reference translation captures the idea of the original phrase more accurately, as ""settling"" is a more common and idiomatic expression in Nepali.
4. Accuracy and fluency:
	* Machine translation: ""In the area of the north, there was a shepherd of the hills, saying that there was something that was started."" - The machine translation is not very fluent or natural-sounding in Nepali, and it contains some grammatical errors.
	* Reference translation: ""In the northern region, the people of the hills had already started settling somewhere called Goth Gotheri."" - The reference translation is more fluent and natural-sounding in Nepali, and it captures the meaning of the original text more accurately.

Based on these analyses, it's clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, natural-sounding, and culturally appropriate, while the machine translation contains grammatical errors and doesn't convey the same meaning as the original text.

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""mercenaries"" to translate the Nepali word ""राजकुमारीहरू"" (raja-kumari-haru), which means ""princesses"" in English.
3. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure and word choice in the machine translation are awkward and unnatural, which can make it difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains a more natural and fluid sentence structure, which makes it easier to understand the meaning of the sentence.

3. Tense: The machine translation is in the past tense, while the reference translation is in the present tense. This is because the reference translation is a direct translation of the original Nepali sentence, which is in the present tense.
4. Use of prepositions: The machine translation uses ""while"" instead of ""while he was speaking,"" which is more idiomatic in English.
5. Name translation: The machine translation translates ""cm punk"" as ""cm punk,"" while the reference translation translates it as ""CM Punk.""
6. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""encounter"" instead of ""confronted,"" which is a more common term in English for a face-to-face meeting.
7. Grammar: The machine translation has a grammatical error in the sentence structure, as it should be ""cm punk had his encounter with McMahon"" instead of ""cm punk had his encounter with ii while mcmen spoke.""

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, use of articles, tense, prepositions, name translation, and grammar.

The machine translation and the reference translation are identical, so there are no differences between them. Both translations convey the same meaning and message, which is that the recording of the album began in February 1995 after the success of something.

However, there are a few things to keep in mind when evaluating the quality of the translation:

1. Fluency: The machine translation is quite fluent and natural-sounding, with no obvious grammatical errors or awkward phrasing. The reference translation is also well-written and easy to understand.
2. Accuracy: Both translations are accurate, as they both convey the same meaning and message. However, it's worth noting that the machine translation is based on a statistical model that relies on patterns in the training data, whereas the reference translation is based on the translator's own understanding of the language and their knowledge of the context.

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""increase"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""grow"" in the present tense. This is a more accurate representation of the original Nepali sentence, which uses the verb ""grow"" in the present tense.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""पानीमा भिजाएपछि"" (After planting it in water) in the reference translation. This is a common idiomatic expression in Nepali, and it is important to preserve it in the translation.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""or in clay"" after ""planting it in water"" instead of before it. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the clarity of the sentence.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation makes a small error in the spelling of the word ""dacla"" in the reference translation. It should be spelled ""दक्ला"" (dakla) instead of ""डाक्ला"" (dakla).

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and spelling. However, it is important to note that machine translation is a complex task and can be affected by various factors, including the quality of the machine learning algorithms and the complexity of the language being translated.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""ड्रागन"" (Dragan) instead of the reference translation's ""Dragon Gate USA"". This suggests that the machine translation may not have accurately captured the nuances of the original Nepali word.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""decided to start"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""had decided""). This difference may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately convey the time frame of the action being described.
3. Phrasing: The machine translation uses the phrase ""सन् २०१०"" (2010) while the reference translation uses "" twenty-ten"". This difference may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately capture the idiomatic expressions and phrasing used in Nepali.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation incorrectly uses the word ""युएसएमै"" (USA) instead of ""Dragon Gate USA"". This suggests that the machine translation may not have accurately captured the correct name of the organization.

Overall, the machine translation appears to have made several errors in word choice, grammar, phrasing, and accuracy. The reference translation, on the other hand, appears to be more accurate and idiomatic in its use of Nepali language. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more reliable and accurate translation of the original Nepali text.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""undertaking"" instead of ""creating"" in the reference translation. This may be due to a difference in nuance, as ""undertaking"" implies a more formal or professional approach to the creation of poetry, while ""creating"" is more general and can encompass a wider range of meanings.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""seems to have been"") in the second sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""seemed to be""). This may be due to a difference in the intended meaning, as the present tense could imply ongoing or continuous action, while the past tense could imply a completed action.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order in the second sentence, placing ""the main purpose"" before ""of creating poetry"". This may be due to a difference in emphasis or style, as the reference translation places the main purpose after the verb ""creating"".
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""historical antiquity themes"" instead of ""historical and archeological subjects"". This may be due to a difference in the way the phrases are commonly used in Nepali and English, as ""historical antiquity themes"" is a more formal or academic term, while ""historical and archeological subjects"" is more general and can encompass a wider range of topics.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation uses the word ""ऐतिहासिक"" (itihāsik), which is a Sanskrit term that refers to things related to history or antiquity. The reference translation uses the more general term ""historical and archeological subjects"". This may be due to a difference in cultural context or intended audience, as ""ऐतिहासिक"" may be more commonly used in academic or scholarly contexts, while ""historical and archeological subjects"" is more general and can be understood by a wider range of readers.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, grammar, word order, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. These differences may be due to a variety of factors, including differences in nuance, style, and cultural context.

Machine Translation:

* ""An alternative is the journal of care, sustainability, energy, power, and solarity.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Vedic period is the confluence of sadhana , siddhi , samathrya , energy and pride .""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses more general words like ""care,"" ""sustainability,"" ""energy,"" ""power,"" and ""solarity"" to translate the Nepali words ""वैदिककाल"" (Vedic period). In contrast, the reference translation uses more specific and technical terms like ""sadhana,"" ""siddhi,"" ""samathrya,"" and ""pride"" to convey the meaning of the original Nepali text.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses simpler sentence structure and verb forms compared to the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the present tense verb form ""is"" to translate ""Vedic period,"" while the reference translation uses the present participle form ""confluence"" to convey the idea of a continuous process.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions and cultural references present in the original Nepali text. For example, the phrase ""सौर्यताको संगम"" (pride of the Vedic period) is not translated directly in the machine translation, and instead, the words ""energy"" and ""solarity"" are used.
4. Cultural nuances: The reference translation captures the cultural nuances of the original Nepali text better than the machine translation. For example, the word ""सौर्यता"" (pride) has a specific cultural connotation in Nepali, which is not fully conveyed in the machine translation.

Overall, the reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally nuanced translation of the original Nepali text compared to the machine translation. However, it's important to note that machine translation can still be useful for getting a general idea of the meaning of a text, and it can also be a useful starting point for further refinement and editing by a human translator.

Machine Translation:

* ""जैविक लिङ्ग र लैङ्गिकतामा फरक छ भन्ने बारे धेरैले नबुझेकाले यो अन्योलता पनि आउन सकिन्छ""

Reference Translation:

* ""This confusion can also come from the fact that many do not understand the difference between biological sex and sexuality""

Comparison:

* The machine translation uses the term ""जैविक लिङ्ग"" (jivik ling) which means ""biological sex"" in Nepali, while the reference translation uses ""biological sex"" directly.
* The machine translation uses the term ""लैङ्गिकतामा"" (laingikatama) which means ""sexuality"" in Nepali, while the reference translation uses ""sexuality"" directly.
* The machine translation adds the phrase ""नबुझेकाले"" (nabujekale) which means ""many"" or ""a lot of"" in Nepali, while the reference translation does not include this phrase.

Conclusion:

Based on the comparison, it can be seen that the machine translation has made some changes to the original Nepali sentence. The term ""जैविक लिङ्ग"" is used instead of ""biological sex"", and the term ""लैङ्गिकतामा"" is used instead of ""sexuality"". Additionally, the machine translation adds the phrase ""नबुझेकाले"" to indicate that many people are confused about the difference between biological sex and sexuality.

Overall, the machine translation has made some changes to the original sentence to make it more understandable in English, but it has also introduced some errors and inaccuracies. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and precise translation of the original Nepali sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""assistant"" to translate ""मावलहरु"" (Mauls), while the reference translation uses ""support"" to translate the same word. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""became"" to translate ""लागि"" (lagi), which is the past participle of the verb ""to become"". The reference translation uses the verb ""proved"" to translate the same word. This is a more significant difference, as the meaning of the sentence changes depending on the verb used.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""as with afghano"" to translate ""अफगानोंको"" (Afghano), which is an idiomatic expression in Nepali. The reference translation does not use this phrase and instead uses the phrase ""for Shershah Suri"". This difference may affect the fluency and naturalness of the translation.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence slightly, placing ""Shivaji Maharaj"" before ""later"".

Machine Translation:

* ""Hanuman went to Lanka, and found sita in Ashoka the earliest.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Hanuman went to Lanka, and meet Sita in Ashok Vatika first.""

Differences:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the verb ""found"" comes after the preposition ""in,"" whereas in the reference translation, it comes before the preposition.
2. Ashoka vs. Ashok Vatika: The machine translation uses the name ""Ashoka"" for the place where Sita was found, while the reference translation uses ""Ashok Vatika."" The difference is in the suffix used to indicate the location. ""Ashoka"" is the singular form of the name, while ""Ashok Vatika"" is the plural form.
3. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""went"") to describe Hanuman's action, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""met""). This difference in tense is due to the different context in which the sentences are used.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""earliest"" to describe the time when Hanuman found Sita, while the reference translation uses the word ""first."" While both words can be used to describe something that happened earlier, ""earliest"" implies a more specific and precise time frame, while ""first"" can be used in a broader context.

Overall, the machine translation has some errors in word order, tense, and word choice compared to the reference translation.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""It was governed by fifty challengers of singing in old times.""
		+ Reference translation: ""In the past, village panchayats were formed by elections.""
		+ Difference: The machine translation uses the verb ""governed"" instead of ""were formed"" to convey the meaning of the reference translation. This is a common mistake in machine translation, as it can't always accurately identify the correct verb form.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: "" fifty challengers of singing in old times""
		+ Reference translation: ""village panchayats""
		+ Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""fifty challengers of singing in old times"" which is not a correct or common phrase in Nepali. The reference translation uses the correct term ""village panchayats"" which is a well-known term in Nepali.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""old times""
		+ Reference translation: ""past""
		+ Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""old times"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic phrase ""past"".
4. Cultural and contextual accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""singing""
		+ Reference translation: ""village panchayats""
		+ Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""singing"" which is not a common or relevant term in the context of Nepali culture or politics. The reference translation uses the correct term ""village panchayats"" which is a well-known term in Nepali politics and culture.
5. Fluency and readability:
	* Machine translation: ""It was governed by fifty challengers of singing in old times.""
		+ Reference translation: ""In the past, village panchayats were formed by elections.""
		+ Difference: The machine translation is less fluent and less readable than the reference translation. The reference translation is more concise and easier to understand, with a more natural flow of language.

Based on these analyses, it's clear that the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""lady"" to translate ""goddess,"" which is not a direct equivalent in Nepali. In Nepali, ""goddess"" is typically translated as "" devi"" or ""Mata.""
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is"" to translate ""तब,"" which is a past tense in Nepali. In Nepali, the past tense is formed using the suffix ""-े"" or ""-ें.""
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""इन्द्रको सेखी हरण गर्ने"" which is a common expression in Nepali. This expression means ""to take away someone's pride or boastfulness.""
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, which can make it difficult to understand. In Nepali, the subject-verb-object word order is more common.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation does not capture the cultural reference to ""Devraj Indra,"" which is a common term in Nepali literature and culture.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Nepali language and culture better, making it a more reliable translation.

Machine Translation:

* ""Thy enemies shall be defiled with many abominations"" - This translation is accurate, as ""defiled"" means to make something impure or unclean. However, the word ""abominations"" is not the most appropriate term to use in this context, as it can have a broader meaning of something that is disgusting or detestable. A more accurate term in this context could be ""insults"" or ""abuses"".
* ""including thy ways"" - This part of the sentence is not accurate. The original Nepali sentence does not mention anything about the speaker's ways, so this addition is not necessary.

Reference Translation:

* ""Your enemies will insult you saying abuses for your manhood"" - This translation is not accurate, as ""abuses"" does not have the same meaning as ""abominations"". ""Abuses"" can refer to any kind of insult or criticism, while ""abominations"" specifically refers to something that is disgusting or detestable. A more accurate term in this context could be ""insults"" or ""slurs"".
* ""what could be more painful for you than that"" - This part of the sentence is not necessary in the reference translation, as the meaning of the sentence is already clear without it.

Overall, the machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence, while the reference translation does a better job of capturing the intended meaning.

Machine Translation:

* ""The additional barrier relating to the distribution of profits from the agency is done in paragraph 13 of the directive.""

Reference Translation:

* ""The distribution of profits from the body is further explained in paragraph 13 of this directive.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""additional barrier"" instead of ""distribution of profits"" in the reference translation.
2. Parallel structure: The machine translation does not maintain the same parallel structure as the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""relating to the distribution of profits from the agency"" is a separate clause, whereas in the reference translation, it is part of the same sentence as ""the distribution of profits from the body.""
3. Precision: The machine translation uses the phrase ""is done in"" instead of ""is further explained in"" in the reference translation. This change in wording may affect the accuracy of the translation, as ""is done in"" implies a more general action, whereas ""is further explained in"" emphasizes the clarity and detail of the explanation.
4. Idiomatic expression: The machine translation does not use an idiomatic expression in the same way as the reference translation. The reference translation uses the phrase ""this directive"" to refer to the document as a whole, which is a common idiomatic expression in Nepali.

Overall, the machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original Nepali sentence as well as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the sentence, which is important for conveying the intended meaning and context of the text.

Machine Translation:

* ""And she went up into the river of Vernkolagh, one day, with the call of the tradition.""

Reference Translation:

* ""One day Parashuram 's mother took an urn and went to the river to fetch water.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""Vernkolagh"" instead of ""Nadime"" which is the correct Nepali word for ""river"".
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""goes"" instead of the past tense ""went"" in the reference translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""with the call of the tradition"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. In Nepali, people usually say ""with the tradition"" or ""according to tradition"".
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, placing ""of Vernkolagh"" after ""one day"" instead of before it.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation gets the name of the river wrong, using ""Vernkolagh"" instead of ""Nadime"".

Overall, the machine translation is not accurate and does not capture the nuances of the Nepali language. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic, and better conveys the meaning of the original sentence.

Machine Translation: ""Then cut the lines of telephones and mobiles across the country.""

* The machine translation uses the verb ""cut"" instead of ""cut out"" which is the correct translation of the Nepali phrase ""काटिए"".
* The phrase ""lines of telephones and mobiles"" is not a natural or idiomatic expression in English, and it would be better to use ""telephone lines"" or ""mobile networks"" instead.

Reference Translation: ""Then the lines of telephones and mobiles cut out across the country.""

* The reference translation uses the correct verb form ""cut out"" to translate the Nepali phrase ""काटिए"".
* The phrase ""lines of telephones and mobiles"" is a more natural and idiomatic expression in English, as it is a common way to refer to the networks of telephone lines and mobile towers that provide communication services.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of grammar and idiomatic expression. The machine translation also uses a less natural phrase to refer to the communication networks, which can make it harder for the reader to understand the meaning of the sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""contestant"" (नै) is used instead of ""emperor"" (सम्राट) in the machine translation.
	* Reference translation: ""emperor"" (सम्राट) is used consistently throughout the reference translation.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The verb tenses are inconsistent in the machine translation. For example, ""was a prominent judge"" (प्रधान न्यायाधीश) is in the past tense, while ""chief of staff"" (मुख्य सेनापति) is in the present tense.
	* Reference translation: The verb tenses are consistent throughout the reference translation, with all verbs in the past tense.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the original Nepali text. For example, ""real estate defender of law"" (कानुनका वास्तविक विधाता) is not a common or idiomatic expression in English.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation captures the idiomatic expressions used in the original Nepali text, such as ""real estate defender of law"" (कानुनका वास्तविक विधाता).
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The word order in the machine translation is different from the reference translation. For example, in the machine translation, ""chief justice"" (मुख्य सेनापति) comes before ""chief of staff"" (मुख्य सेनापति), while in the reference translation, ""chief of staff"" (मुख्य सेनापति) comes after ""chief justice"" (मुख्य सेनापति).
5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the cultural references used in the original Nepali text. For example, the term ""emperor"" (सम्राट) is a cultural reference that may not be familiar to non-Nepali speakers.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation captures the cultural references used in the original Nepali text, such as ""emperor"" (सम्राट).

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, word order, and cultural references. The reference translation provides a more faithful translation of the original Nepali text, while the machine translation is more of a rough translation that may not be understandable or accurate for non-Nepali speakers.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Someone who is poisoned is willing to respond to his sexual desires.""
	* Reference translation: ""If someone is heterosexual, they have a desire to have their genital transformation surgery.""

The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense in the subject ""Someone"" and also uses the wrong word ""desires"" instead of ""desire"" in the second sentence.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""विषुलिङ्गी"" (poisoned)
	* Reference translation: ""heterosexual""

The machine translation uses the Nepali word ""विषुलिङ्गी"" which means ""poisoned"" in English, while the reference translation uses the English word ""heterosexual"".

3. Meaning:
	* Machine translation: ""Someone who is poisoned is willing to respond to his sexual desires.""
	* Reference translation: ""If someone is heterosexual, they have a desire to have their genital transformation surgery.""

The machine translation completely changes the meaning of the original sentence. The original sentence is about someone who is willing to undergo a surgery, while the machine translation is about someone who is willing to respond to their sexual desires.

4. Context:
	* Machine translation: N/A
	* Reference translation: N/A

The machine translation and reference translation are not in the same context, as the machine translation is a standalone sentence, while the reference translation is part of a larger sentence.

Based on the above analysis, it is clear that the machine translation is of poor quality and does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and conveys the intended meaning of the original sentence.

	* Reference translation: ""Social culture and practices of Tamang community who have carried thier own type of special ancestry and social cuture has been outlined below.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the present tense ""are"" to describe the social behaviors, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""have carried"" to describe the Tamang community's ancestry and social culture.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""maneuvering"" (three times)
	* Reference translation: none
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""maneuvering"" three times, while the reference translation does not use this word at all.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: none
	* Reference translation: ""outlined below""
	* Difference: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""outlined below"" to indicate the content that follows.
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""The social behaviors of the tamang nation including maneuvering, maneuvering, and maneuvering are described below.""
	* Reference translation: ""Social culture and practices of Tamang community who have carried thier own type of special ancestry and social cuture has been outlined below.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure with three parallel phrases, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with a subordinate clause.
5. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""tamang nation"" should be ""Tamang community""
	* Reference translation: none
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the incorrect term ""tamang nation,"" while the reference translation uses the correct term ""Tamang community.""

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""uneconomic activity"" instead of ""uneconomic actitivity"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""goes to its limit"") in both clauses, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""went to its limit"") in the second clause. This difference in verb tense is due to the way the machine translation engine processes language.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""goes to its limit"" in the reference translation. This is a common idiomatic expression used in Nepali to convey the idea of something reaching its maximum extent or degree.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the second clause, placing ""then"" before ""uneconomic activity"" instead of after it. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the flow of the sentence.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation accurately translates the core meaning of the sentence, but it does not capture the nuances of the Nepali language. For example, the word ""आर्थिक"" (arthis) in the reference translation has a broader meaning than the word ""economic activity"" in English.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in capturing the nuances of the Nepali language. While it gets the core meaning of the sentence right, it does not fully convey the idiomatic expressions and word choices used in the reference translation. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher rating than the machine translation.

Machine Translation: ""That the architect or predecessor should do the ostensibly.""

* The machine translation uses the word ""ostensibly"" which is a bit awkward and not the most idiomatic way to express the idea in Nepali. In Nepali, ""ostensibly"" means ""apparently"" or ""seemingly"", but it's not a very common word in everyday language.
* The phrase ""should do"" is also a bit awkward in Nepali, as the verb ""do"" is not typically used in the sense of ""should"" in Nepali. In Nepali, ""should"" is usually expressed using the verb ""माफ गर्नु"" (maaf garne) or ""माफ गर्ने"" (maaf garne).

Reference Translation: ""We should work on it with full of urges or prejudices.""

* The reference translation is much more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Nepali. The phrase ""full of urges or prejudices"" is a good way to express the idea of working on something with enthusiasm and dedication.
* The verb ""work on it"" is also more natural in Nepali than the machine translation's ""should do.""

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation for this sentence. The machine translation uses some words and phrases that are not typical in Nepali, and the sentence structure is also a bit awkward.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""participated"" to translate the Nepali word ""गराइयो"" (garaiyo), which means ""to take part in"" or ""to join in"". In contrast, the reference translation uses the word ""were made to participate"" to convey the same meaning.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense ""actively participated"" to translate the Nepali sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""were made to participate"" to indicate that the activities took place in the past.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the Nepali sentence to make it more grammatically correct in English. In Nepali, the sentence is structured as ""गराइयो सक्रियतापूर्वक अतिरिक्त क्रियाकलाप"", but the machine translation rearranges the words to make it ""West actively participated in various sports, cultural, religious activities"".
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the Nepali sentence. For example, the phrase ""अतिरिक्त क्रियाकलाप"" (extraordinary activities) is not a direct translation of the Nepali word ""सांस्कृतिक, साहित्यिक गतिविधिहरुमा"" (cultural, literary activities).
5. Grammar: The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the indefinite article ""a"" before ""sports"" and ""cultural"" activities, which should be ""some sports"" and ""some cultural activities"".

Overall, while the machine translation attempts to convey the meaning of the Nepali sentence, it has several errors in word choice, tense, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Nepali sentence.

2. Tense consistency: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is associated"") throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was associated"") in the second sentence. This inconsistency in tense can make the sentence sound less natural and less clear.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the adjective "" improved"" after the noun ""quality of life"", while the reference translation places it before the noun. This difference in word order can affect the emphasis and clarity of the sentence.
4. Comparative form: The machine translation uses the comparative form of ""better"" (""better than iapratropium""), while the reference translation uses the superlative form (""best""). The choice between these two forms depends on the context and the intended meaning, but in this case, the reference translation's use of the superlative form may be more appropriate.
5. Unnecessary words: The machine translation includes the word ""those"" after ""benefits"", which is unnecessary and can make the sentence sound less clear.
6. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""provides"" in the third person singular form, while the reference translation uses the verb ""provides"" in the third person plural form. This difference in verb form can affect the sentence's grammar and clarity.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses more informal and colloquial language, such as ""daman"" instead of ""frustration,"" ""hintha"" instead of ""inferiority,"" and ""palladium"" instead of ""proprietor of the palladium."" The reference translation, on the other hand, uses more formal and literary language, such as ""oppression"" instead of ""frustration,"" ""inferiority"" instead of ""hintha,"" and ""proprietor"" instead of ""palladium.""
2. Grammar: The machine translation has more grammatical errors than the reference translation. For example, in the first sentence, the machine translation uses the verb ""found"" in the past tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""arises"" in the present tense. In the second sentence, the machine translation uses the verb ""running"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""tendency to run away"" in the present perfect tense.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation often uses idiomatic expressions that are not commonly used in Nepali, such as ""dishonest mind"" instead of ""hintha"" (which means ""inferiority"" in Nepali). The reference translation, on the other hand, uses more idiomatic expressions that are commonly used in Nepali, such as ""feeling of emptiness"" instead of ""nissarabodh"" (which means ""emptiness"" in Nepali).
4. Cultural references: The machine translation often includes cultural references that are not familiar to Nepali readers, such as ""palladium"" (which is a reference to a mythical object in ancient Greek mythology). The reference translation, on the other hand, uses more culturally relevant references, such as ""proprietor"" instead of ""palladium.""
5. Tone: The machine translation has a more informal and conversational tone, while the reference translation has a more formal and literary tone.

Overall, the machine translation is not accurate in this case as it changes the meaning of the original sentence. The reference translation stays closer to the original meaning of the Nepali sentence.

Here are some suggestions for improving the machine translation:

1. Use a more accurate dictionary: The machine translation uses a dictionary that is not suitable for the context of the sentence. Using a more appropriate dictionary could result in a more accurate translation.
2. Use contextual information: The machine translation does not take into account the context of the sentence, which can lead to inaccuracies. Using contextual information, such as the previous sentence or the overall topic of the text, can help improve the translation.
3. Use a more advanced translation algorithm: The machine translation algorithm used in this case is not sophisticated enough to capture the nuances of the Nepali language. Using a more advanced algorithm, such as a neural network-based translation system, could result in more accurate translations.

The machine translation makes several errors in this sentence:

1. ""These"" is not the correct word to use in this context. The correct word would be ""यहाँ"" (yahan) which means ""here"".
2. ""Lucy"" is not a Nepali name, and it doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. The correct name in Nepali is ""लक्ष्मण"" (Lakshman).
3. ""and Lucy"" is also not a valid phrase in Nepali.
4. ""and troubles"" is not a correct translation of the Nepali word ""लक्षु"" (Lakshu). The correct translation would be ""लक्षु"" (Lakshu) itself.

Reference Translation:

* ""Here his sons Lakshman, Lakshu, Shankar were also cut.""

The reference translation is more accurate and correct than the machine translation. It correctly translates ""यहाँ"" (yahan) as ""here"", and uses the correct names ""लक्ष्मण"" (Lakshman) and ""लक्षु"" (Lakshu) for the sons of the speaker.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""expression"" instead of ""epic"" in the reference translation. While ""expression"" can refer to a creative work or a feeling, it doesn't quite convey the same level of importance as ""epic"" in this context.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""has been done"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was the first""). This difference in tense can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the past tense emphasizes that the event occurred at a specific point in time, while the present tense suggests that the event is ongoing or continuous.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, placing ""his concern"" before ""the planet"" instead of after it. This can make the sentence feel less natural and more awkward to read.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""the first expression of the epic in the West"" to convey the idea that the epic is being expressed or performed for the first time in the West. The machine translation doesn't quite capture this nuance, using the more general phrase ""his concern has been more important.""
5. Cultural context: The reference translation takes into account the cultural context of the epic being performed in the West, which is important to convey the significance of the event. The machine translation doesn't provide the same level of cultural context, which can make the sentence feel less nuanced and less accurate.

Overall, while both translations convey the basic meaning of the sentence, the reference translation is more accurate and nuanced in its word choice, tense, word order, idiomatic expressions, and cultural context. As a result, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Summons people's dragon gathering"" is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase should be ""gather the people's strength"" or ""mobilize the people's power.""
	* Reference translation: ""By gathering the strength of the entire people"" is grammatically correct.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: The phrase ""dragon gathering"" is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. A more accurate translation would be ""people's power"" or ""mass movement.""
	* Reference translation: ""overthrow the authoritarian family rule"" is a more accurate translation of the original Nepali phrase ""स्वेच्छाचारी पारिवारिक शासनलाई उखेलेर फ्याक्ने निश्चय गरेको छ.""
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: The phrase ""facilitate an ultimately arbitrary rule"" is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. A more accurate translation would be ""establish a democratic system"" or ""bring about a change in the political system.""
	* Reference translation: ""make a final movement"" is a more accurate translation of the original Nepali phrase ""फ्याक्ने निश्चय गरेको छ.""
4. Cultural context:
	* Machine translation: The phrase ""summons people's dragon"" is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali culture. The phrase ""gather the people's strength"" or ""mobilize the people's power"" would be more appropriate.
	* Reference translation: The phrase ""authoritarian family rule"" is a more accurate translation of the original Nepali phrase ""पारिवारिक शासनलाई उखेलेर फ्याक्ने निश्चय गरेको छ.""

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali phrase better, including the cultural context and the specific word choice.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""troubled"" to describe Huzur's state of mind, while the reference translation uses the word ""lazy."" While both words can be translated as ""हजुर"" in Nepali, the connotations are different. ""Troubled"" implies a sense of worry or concern, while ""lazy"" implies a lack of motivation or energy.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""had been"" to describe Huzur's state of mind, while the reference translation uses the present tense ""used to be."" This difference in tense can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the past tense implies that Huzur's state of mind was a recurring issue, while the present tense implies that it was a habitual state.
3. Word order: The machine translation places the verb ""to store"" after the noun ""money,"" while the reference translation places it before. This difference in word order can affect the emphasis of the sentence, with the machine translation placing more emphasis on the act of storing money, while the reference translation placing more emphasis on Huzur's state of mind.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""नष्ट भयो"" (lost) to describe the state of Huzur's wealth, while the machine translation does not use any idiomatic expression. While both translations convey the idea that Huzur's wealth was lost, the reference translation uses a more common and idiomatic expression in Nepali.
5. Cultural references: The reference translation includes a cultural reference to the practice of collecting and taking care of wealth in Nepal, which is not present in the machine translation. This cultural reference can help to make the translation more contextual and culturally appropriate.

Overall, while both translations convey the basic meaning of the sentence, the reference translation is more idiomatic and culturally appropriate, while the machine translation is more literal and lacks cultural context. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

Machine Translation: ""The majority of Samweed's ministers are from negotiations.""

Reference Translation: ""The majority of spell in Samved are taken from Rigveda.""

1. Word choice: In the machine translation, the word ""ministers"" is used instead of ""spell"" which is the correct term in Nepali.
2. Source: The machine translation suggests that the majority of Samweed's officials are from negotiations, whereas the reference translation indicates that the majority of the spells in Samved are taken from Rigveda.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""are"" to indicate the majority, whereas the reference translation uses the past tense ""were"" to indicate that the spells in Samved are taken from Rigveda.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation seems to be inaccurate in this case as Samved is a Sanskrit text and does not contain the word ""negotiations"".
5. Fluency: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation, which is more idiomatic and natural in Nepali.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation in this case. The reference translation provides a more accurate and natural-sounding translation of the original Nepali sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""token"" to translate the Nepali word ""सर्पले"" (sarpale), which is not a common term in English. In the reference translation, the word ""poisonous snakes"" is used instead, which is a more accurate and common term in English.
2. Number agreement: In the machine translation, the number ""15 hundred"" is translated as ""१५ सयदेखि"" (15 sayadekhi), which is incorrect. In Nepali, the number ""15 hundred"" should be translated as ""१५ सय"" (15 sai). Similarly, the number ""2 thousand"" is translated as ""२ हजार"" (2 hajar) in the machine translation, but it should be translated as ""२ थousand"" in English.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""are"" to translate the Nepali verb ""विषालु"" (visalu), which is incorrect. In English, the verb ""bite"" is in the past tense, so it should be translated as ""bit"" or ""bitted"" in the reference translation.
4. Word order: In the machine translation, the word order is different from the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""about 15 hundred to 2 thousand persons"" is translated as ""Those 15 hundred to 2 thousand persons with poisonous serpent token."" In the reference translation, the phrase ""among them"" is added after the number ""2 thousand"" to indicate that the bitten persons are among the total number of people.

Overall, the machine translation is not accurate in terms of word choice, number agreement, grammar, and word order. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic in English.

Machine Translation: ""Therefore this time of the eastern plain has been recognized as a depreciation.""

Reference Translation: ""This is why this period of the Eastern epic is known as the declining period.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""depreciation,"" which is not a direct equivalent of the Nepali word ""ह्रासोन्मुख"" (hrāsonmukh). The reference translation uses the word ""declining period,"" which is a more accurate translation of the Nepali word.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""has been recognized"" instead of the past tense ""was known"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""ह्रासोन्मुख"" (hrāsonmukh), which is a common phrase used in Nepali to refer to a particular period or era. The reference translation uses the phrase ""declining period,"" which is a more literal translation of the Nepali word.
4. Cultural references: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the Nepali phrase ""ह्रासोन्मुख"" (hrāsonmukh), which is a term used in Nepali literature and history to refer to a particular period or era. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses a phrase that is more culturally relevant and accurate.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. The reference translation provides a more nuanced and accurate translation of the Nepali sentence, which is important for conveying the intended meaning and context of the original text.

Machine Translation:

* ""Received extracts are tested which are called to test alternatives.""

Reference Translation:

Key differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""extracts"" instead of ""results"" in the reference translation.
2. Terminology: The machine translation uses the term ""test alternatives"" instead of ""hypothesis testing"" in the reference translation.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are called"") instead of the past tense (""were tested"") in the reference translation.
4. Idiomatic expression: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""hypothesis testing"" in the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original Nepali sentence as accurately as the reference translation. The reference translation uses more formal and technical language, which is more appropriate for a scientific context. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses simpler language that may not convey the same level of precision and accuracy.

Based on this analysis, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation. The machine translation has some errors in word choice, terminology, grammar, and idiomatic expression, which can affect the overall accuracy and readability of the translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""house"" multiple times in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the word ""home"" only once. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tense consistency: The machine translation switches between past and present tense in the sentence. For example, ""And it was not for the poor in the house"" is in the past tense, while ""but Hitan borrowed money from a bookstore to read"" is in the present tense. The reference translation maintains a consistent tense throughout the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""in the house"" are placed after the verb ""was not,"" while in the reference translation, they are placed before the verb. This can affect the emphasis and clarity of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""due to poverty"" to convey the idea that there was no food at home.

Machine Translation (MT): Zatak is shown to have survived with his family, and with his brother and sister.

Reference Translation (RT): It is seen that Jatak harrashes in relation problem with his family and especially with his brother and sisters.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The MT uses the word ""survived"" to translate the Nepali word ""जातकले"" (jātakale), while the RT uses ""harrashes"" to translate the same word. ""Survived"" is a more formal and literal translation of ""जातकले"", but ""harrashes"" is a more common and natural way to express the idea of ""surviving"" in English.
2. Grammar: The MT uses the present tense verb form ""is shown"" to translate the Nepali verb ""र खासगरी"" (ra khāsagari), which is in the imperfective aspect. The RT uses the past tense verb form ""harrashes"" to translate the same verb. The use of the past tense in the RT is more appropriate because the sentence is describing a past event.
3. Word order: The MT changes the word order of the Nepali sentence to make it more similar to English. In Nepali, the subject ""Zatak"" comes before the verb ""is shown"", but in English, the subject typically comes after the verb.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The RT uses the idiomatic expression ""especially with"" to translate the Nepali phrase ""सम्बद्ध सम्याले"" (sambadh samyāle), which means ""with his brother and sisters"". This is a more natural and idiomatic way to express the idea in English.

Overall, while the MT is grammatically correct, it lacks the nuance and naturalness of the RT. The RT provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Nepali sentence, making it a better choice for communication in English.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""workmanship"" which is not a common term in Nepali. In Nepali, ""karmic fruit"" or ""karmic result"" would be more appropriate.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""are"" to describe the involvement of Rahu and Ketu, while the reference translation uses the present participle ""have"" to convey a deeper connection.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""our workmanship of the planet"" which is not a common idiomatic expression in Nepali. In Nepali, ""our karmic fruit"" or ""our karmic result"" would be more appropriate.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. The reference translation more accurately conveys the idea that Rahu and Ketu have a deep connection with the karmic fruit or result of one's actions.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""गृह"" (home)
	* Reference translation: ""Home""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Nepali word ""गृह"" which is the correct term for ""home"" in Nepali.
3. Sentence structure:

2. Tense consistency: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the phrase ""submitting the research proposal."" This difference in tense can make the sentence sound less coherent and less natural.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order slightly, placing ""after determining"" before ""problems in sustainable research order."" In the reference translation, the word order is more natural, with ""problems in sustainable research order"" coming after ""determining.""

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""attendant"" to translate ""सङ्घीय"" (sanghiya), which is not a commonly used word in English. A more appropriate translation for this word would be ""Federal"". So, the first difference is in the word choice.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""is"" in the subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, while the reference translation uses the verb ""has"" in the subject-verb-object (SVO) structure. This difference in grammar structure can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""बढी सहभागितामूलक"" (badi sambhagita mulak) which means ""there will be a sharing of power"". This expression is not commonly used in English, so it may not be easily recognizable to a non-native speaker.
4. Tone: The machine translation gives a more formal tone, while the reference translation has a more conversational tone. The reference translation uses the word ""representative"" which gives a more informal tone.
5. Cultural nuances: The machine translation does not capture the cultural nuances of the Nepali language, such as the use of the word ""सङ्घीय"" (sanghiya) which carries a specific meaning in Nepali politics.

Based on these differences, I would say that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation.

For example, in the machine translation, ""थिए जब ब्रायनले ओर्टनलाई स्टेफिनी म्याकमेन माथि धक्का दिएका थिए"" is translated as ""When braun had paired Orton to Stephinie Mcmain,"" whereas in the reference translation, it is translated as ""At the 2013 Slammy Awards, Triple H hit Randy Orton with Pedigree when Brian pushed Orton over Stephanie McMahon.""
3. Grammar: The machine translation has some grammatical errors. For example, in the machine translation, ""थिए जब ब्रायनले ओर्टनलाई स्टेफिनी म्याकमेन माथि धक्का दिएका थिए"" is translated as a single sentence, whereas in the reference translation, it is translated as two separate sentences.
4. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses some different vocabulary than the reference translation. For example, in the machine translation, ""थिए"" is translated as ""hit,"" whereas in the reference translation, it is translated as ""held.""
5. Context: The machine translation does not provide enough context for the sentence. In the machine translation, it is not clear who ""थिए"" is referring to or what action they are performing. In the reference translation, the context is provided by the surrounding sentences, which make it clear that ""Triple H"" is the one who hit Randy Orton with the Pedigree.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, phrasing, grammar, vocabulary, and context. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating than the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation:

* ""Because it is easy to say that the basis of tradition with the east is Samweed.""

Reference Translation:

* ""For this reason, it can easily be said that the basis of tradition of eastern music is Saamved.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""Samweed"" instead of ""Saamved"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""Samweed"" is not a recognized word in Nepali or any other language. On the other hand, ""Saamved"" is a correctly spelled and recognized Nepali word that means ""tradition"" or ""culture.""
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense verb form ""is"" instead of the correct verb form ""is"" in the reference translation. In Nepali, the verb form ""is"" is used in the present tense to indicate a general or habitual action.
3. Accuracy: The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. The reference translation more accurately conveys the meaning of the sentence by using the correct word ""Saamved"" instead of ""Samweed.""
4. Fluency: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The reference translation uses more natural and idiomatic language, which makes it easier to understand and read.

Overall, the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, accuracy, and fluency. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and natural-sounding translation of the original sentence.

Machine Translation: His birthplace is situated in lamjung district ko simpani.

Reference Translation: He was born in Simpani of Lamjung district on B.S.

The machine translation makes several errors in this sentence:

1. Word order: In Nepali, the word order is typically SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), but in the machine translation, it is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). For example, ""His birthplace"" should be ""He was born in"" in Nepali.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the wrong verb form for ""birthplace."" In Nepali, the verb ""birth"" is in the past tense, so the correct verb form for ""birthplace"" is ""birthplace"" (not ""birthplace is"").
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""ko"" instead of ""of"" to indicate possession. In Nepali, the correct word to use in this context is ""of.""
4. Spelling: The machine translation spells ""Simpani"" incorrectly. The correct spelling is ""Simpani.""

Overall, the machine translation is of poor quality and does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and better conveys the meaning of the original sentence.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the name ""Jayabharathi"" instead of ""Jaya Bahadur"" in the reference translation.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""should be"") in the second sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""believed"").
3. Voice: The machine translation uses the active voice (""Jayabharathi assumed"") in the first sentence, while the reference translation uses the passive voice (""one should be a scholar by studying"").
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the second sentence, placing ""Jayabharathi"" before ""assumed"".
5. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""studying"" to convey the idea of acquiring knowledge, while the machine translation does not use any idiomatic expression.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The reference translation provides a more natural and idiomatic expression in English, while the machine translation seems to be more literal and lacks the nuances of language.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""born out of"" instead of ""born from"" to convey the meaning of ""समष्टिकाे"" (Samsthikaa), which means ""community"" in Nepali. While ""born out of"" is a common phrase used in English, it doesn't quite convey the same nuance as ""born from"" in this context.
2. Tone: The machine translation gives a more formal and distant tone, while the reference translation has a more informal and conversational tone. The reference translation uses ""heart of the community"" instead of ""mind of Samstha"" to make the sentence more relatable and personal.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the passive voice in the sentence, which can make it sound less engaging and less clear than the active voice used in the reference translation. For example, ""So lake music came to be born"" sounds less natural than ""That is why folk songs are born"".
4. Idioms and expressions: The machine translation doesn't quite capture the cultural nuances of the Nepali idiom ""समष्टिकाे मनबाट"" (Samsthikaa manbataa), which means ""from the heart of the community"". The reference translation uses a more literal translation of the idiom to convey the meaning.
5. Fluency: The machine translation can sometimes struggle with the fluency of the Nepali language, especially when it comes to idiomatic expressions and cultural references. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more fluent and natural-sounding.

Overall, while the machine translation is accurate in terms of grammar and vocabulary, it lacks the cultural nuance and natural flow of the Nepali language. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more idiomatic and culturally appropriate, making it a better choice for communication with native speakers.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""According to the causes and devotions done to human birth"" is a grammatically correct sentence, but it could be improved by rephrasing it to ""According to the causes and devotions done in human birth.""
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the original sentence structure of the Nepali sentence, which is a more accurate representation of the original text.
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the word ""cedarlokes"" instead of ""higher worlds"" in the reference translation. While ""cedarlokes"" is a valid English word, it doesn't have the same connotation as ""higher worlds"" in this context.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the word ""Punya"" instead of ""pleasure"" in the machine translation. ""Punya"" is a Sanskrit word that means ""merit"" or ""good deeds,"" which is a more accurate translation of the Nepali word ""पुण्य"" in this context.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""जान्छ र आफ्नो पूण्य समाप्त भए"" in the Nepali sentence. This expression is a common idiom in Nepali that means ""to attain the end of one's merit"" or ""to complete one's good deeds.""
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the idiomatic expression in the Nepali sentence, which is a more accurate representation of the original text.
4. Cultural and religious context:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation doesn't take into account the cultural and religious context of the Nepali sentence. For example, the reference translation uses the term ""higher worlds"" instead of ""cedarlokes,"" which is a more appropriate term in the context of Hinduism and Buddhism.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the cultural and religious context of the Nepali sentence, which is important for conveying the intended meaning and significance of the text.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali text than the machine translation. While the machine translation is grammatically correct, it lacks the nuance and cultural context that is present in the original Nepali sentence.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the machine translation for the given sentence. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Grammar and syntax:
The machine translation has correctly captured the grammatical structure of the source sentence. Both Rahu and ketu are in the nominative case, and the verb ""are called"" is in the third person singular.
2. Vocabulary:
The machine translation has used the correct English words for the Nepali words in the source sentence. ""Shadow planets"" is a good translation for ""दुबै ग्रहलाई छायाँग्रह"" (dubai grahlai chhayangrah), and ""there is no physical mass"" is a good translation for ""किनभने आकाशमा यी दुबै ग्रहको भौतिक पिण्ड"" (kine bhane aakashma yie dubai grahko bhauteek pind).
3. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation has not captured some of the idiomatic expressions in the source sentence. For example, ""shadow planets"" is not a common phrase used in English to refer to Rahu and ketu. In English, these two planets are usually referred to as ""Rahu"" and ""Ketu.""
4. Cultural references:
The machine translation has not taken into account any cultural references in the source sentence. For example, in Hindu astrology, Rahu and ketu are considered to be shadow planets because they are not physically present in the sky, but their influence is still felt. This cultural context is not captured in the machine translation.
5. Fluency and readability:
The machine translation is not very fluent or readable. The sentence structure is a bit awkward, and the use of the phrase ""shadow planets"" is not very natural-sounding. A human translator would likely use a more natural phrase like ""Rahu and ketu are considered shadow planets.""

Overall, the machine translation is not very accurate or natural-sounding. A human translator would likely produce a more fluent and culturally appropriate translation.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""निकै राम्रो अस्पताल"" - The word ""निकै"" is not a suitable translation for ""very good"" in English. A more appropriate translation would be ""a very good hospital"".
	* Reference translation: ""a very good hospital"" - This translation is more accurate and idiomatic.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""भएको छ"" - This phrase is not commonly used in English, and a more appropriate translation would be ""has been built"".
	* Reference translation: ""has been built"" - This translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English.
4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone of the machine translation is more formal and lacks the personal touch of the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: The tone of the reference translation is more conversational and friendly, which is more suitable for a casual conversation or a blog post.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding in English compared to the machine translation. The reference translation uses more idiomatic expressions and has a more conversational tone, which makes it easier to understand and more enjoyable to read.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""influence"" to describe the effect of Saturn on Hanuman's body, while the reference translation uses the word ""effect."" While both words can be used to describe the same concept, ""influence"" has a broader meaning and could be interpreted as a more subtle or indirect effect, while ""effect"" is more direct and immediate.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""requested"" in the past tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""asked"" in the present tense. This difference in verb tense is due to the different time frames of the two translations. The machine translation is trying to convey the idea that Saturn requested Hanuman for a blessing at some point in the past, while the reference translation is trying to convey the idea that Saturn is asking Hanuman for a blessing at the present moment.
3. Word order: The machine translation places the word ""before"" in front of ""Hanuman,"" while the reference translation places it after ""Hanuman."" This difference in word order is due to the different emphasis placed on the relationship between Saturn and Hanuman in the two translations. In the machine translation, Saturn is emphasizing the idea that he is requesting something from Hanuman, while in the reference translation, Hanuman is being emphasized as the one being asked for a blessing.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""join hands"" to describe the act of Saturn and Hanuman touching hands, while the reference translation uses the more literal translation ""ask for a blessing."" While both expressions can convey the same meaning, the idiomatic expression used in the reference translation may be more natural and idiomatic in Nepali.
5. Tone: The machine translation has a more formal and distant tone, while the reference translation has a more informal and conversational tone. This difference in tone is due to the different styles of language used in the two translations, with the machine translation aiming for a more literal and accurate translation, and the reference translation aiming for a more natural and conversational tone.

Overall, the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation highlight the importance of considering the nuances of language and culture when translating. While machine translation can be a useful tool for quick and rough translations, it may not always capture the subtleties and nuances of language that are important for conveying the intended meaning and tone of a text.

2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""cannot be resolved"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""cannot be resolved""). This difference is due to the fact that the reference translation is based on a previous study, while the machine translation is a real-time translation.
3. Word order: In the machine translation, the words "" observation"" and ""review"" are separated by a comma, while in the reference translation, they are combined into a single phrase "" observation and review"". This difference in word order can affect the clarity and readability of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""स्पष्ट हुन सकिरहेको"" (spaṣṭa hūn sakirāhekō) instead of ""concentrate the attention"". While both expressions convey the same meaning, the machine translation may not be as idiomatic or natural-sounding as the reference translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""समस्याबारे"" (samsya-bāre) in the nominative case, while the reference translation uses it in the accusative case. This difference in grammar can affect the sentence structure and meaning.

Overall, while the machine translation is generally understandable, there are some differences in word choice, tense, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar that can affect the quality of the translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more idiomatic and natural-sounding, and better conveys the intended meaning of the original Nepali sentence.

Based on the above analysis, it is clear that the machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation. The machine translation contains several errors in grammar, vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable source for Nepali-English translation.

Machine Translation: ""Asyrians consider some deity given in the field of religious sciences.""

Reference Translation: ""The Asyrians are believed to have given some contributions in the field of literature science.""

Here are the differences I found between the two translations:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""deity"" which is not a common term in Nepali. In the reference translation, the word ""contributions"" is used instead of ""deity"".
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""consider"" which is in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense verb ""believed"" to indicate that the Asyrians made these contributions in the past.
3. Domain-specific terminology: The machine translation uses the term ""religious sciences"" which may not be a commonly used term in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses the term ""literature science"" which is more commonly used in Nepali.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation seems to have mistranslated the word ""asyrians"" as ""Asyrians"".

Overall, the machine translation seems to have made several errors in word choice, grammar, and domain-specific terminology. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and idiomatic in Nepali. Therefore, I would give a lower rating to the machine translation and recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable translation.

Machine Translation:

* ""Organization Fatca s. N./ s. N. offered regulations of integration or separation""

Reference Translation:

* ""SN of section of the organisation / proposed by SSN for unification or division""

Differences:

1. Use of ""s. N."" vs. ""SN"": In the machine translation, the source text uses ""s. N."" (sahayak niyam) instead of ""SN"" (sahayak niyam). This is a minor difference, but it may affect the accuracy of the translation.
2. Use of ""offered"" vs. ""proposed"": In the machine translation, the verb ""offered"" is used to translate the Nepali word ""गरिएको"" (garieko), which means ""proposed"". This is a significant difference, as ""offered"" implies a more active and deliberate action, whereas ""proposed"" is a more neutral term that simply means ""suggested"".
3. Use of ""integration or separation"": In the machine translation, the phrase ""integration or separation"" is translated as ""एकिकरण वा विभाजनका"" (ekikaran va vibhajanka). However, the reference translation uses the phrase ""unification or division"" to better convey the meaning of the Nepali text.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the original Nepali text. The use of ""s. N."" instead of ""SN"", the inaccurate translation of ""गरिएको"" as ""offered"", and the use of a different phrase to translate ""ekikaran va vibhajanka"" all contribute to a less accurate translation.

1. Word choice: In the machine translation, the word ""mysteries"" is translated as ""हास्यतत्व"" (haasyaatatva), which is a more formal and literary term for ""mystery"" in Nepali. In the reference translation, the word ""humor"" is used instead of ""हास्यतत्व"" to translate the same term. This difference in word choice may affect the overall tone and style of the translation.
2. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""such bantering"" to translate the Nepali phrase ""यस्ता निबन्ध प्रभावकारी"" (yasta nibandh prabhāvakāri). This phrase is not a direct translation of any English idiom, and the machine translation may not capture the nuances of the original Nepali phrase. In contrast, the reference translation uses the phrase ""such essays"" to translate the same term, which is a more common and idiomatic expression in English.
3. Sentence structure: The machine translation and the reference translation differ in their sentence structure. The machine translation uses a longer and more complex sentence structure, with multiple clauses and phrases, while the reference translation uses a simpler and more direct sentence structure. This difference in sentence structure may affect the clarity and readability of the translation.
4. Tone: The machine translation has a more formal and serious tone, while the reference translation has a more conversational and informal tone. This difference in tone may be due to the choice of words and phrases used in each translation, as well as the overall style and structure of the translation.

Overall, while both translations are understandable, the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English, while the machine translation is more formal and may not capture the nuances of the original Nepali text. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and high-quality translation of the given text.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""hunting and hunting"" instead of ""interests and status"" in the reference translation.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""can affect"") in the first sentence, while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense (""cannot affect"") in the second sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""alternative hunting changes"" which may not be a common or natural way to express the idea in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses a more straightforward and idiomatic expression ""marital status"".
4. Accuracy: The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The sentence is actually talking about how a change in marital status (e.g. divorce, remarriage) cannot affect the interests and status of children, but the machine translation has interpreted it as a reference to hunting.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the original Nepali sentence and is more idiomatic in its expression.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""surprised"" to describe the man's reaction, while the reference translation uses ""surprised to see the scene."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference translation uses a more specific word to convey the idea that the man was surprised by what he saw.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""called"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""called."" This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame in which the action took place. The reference translation is more accurate in this regard, as the action of calling the other farmers occurred in the past.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""other halia farmers,"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. In Nepali, ""halia"" refers to a specific type of farmer, so it would be more accurate to use the phrase ""other Haliya farmers.""
4. Word order: The machine translation places the word ""who"" at the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation places it after the verb ""observed."" In Nepali, the word order is generally SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), so the reference translation is more consistent with this grammatical structure.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation uses the term ""Haliya farmers,"" which may not be familiar to all readers. In Nepal, ""Haliya"" refers to a specific type of farmer who works on the plains, so it may be more accurate to use a more general term like ""farmers"" or ""field workers.""

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. It uses more specific language to convey the meaning of the sentence, and it is more consistent with the grammatical structure and cultural references of Nepali.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""rather than"" to convey the idea of time, while the reference translation uses ""about 25 hundred years ago."" The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as ""hundred"" is not a unit of time, and ""about 25 hundred years ago"" is not a clear or concise way to express the idea.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in the sentence ""The word has been used in one place only,"" while the reference translation uses the past tense in ""The word Gautam and Buddha are used only in one place."" The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as the sentence is describing a historical event that occurred in the past.
3. Phrasing: The machine translation uses the phrase ""beginning from about 25 hundred years ago,"" while the reference translation uses ""which started about 2500 years before the birth of Gautam Buddha."" The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as it provides more context and clarity about the time period being referred to.
4. Word order: The machine translation places the word ""only"" at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation places it earlier in the sentence. The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as the word ""only"" should be placed earlier in the sentence to convey the idea of emphasis.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and clear than the machine translation in this case. The reference translation provides more context and clarity about the time period being referred to, and uses more accurate grammar and phrasing to convey the idea.

Machine Translation:

* The sentence structure is not accurate. The original sentence is in the present tense, but the machine translation has changed it to the past tense (""Sitting in this vowel, Rahu makes a perpetual journey"").
* The word ""vowel"" is not a correct translation of the Nepali word ""भावमा"" (bhāvamā). The correct translation for this word is ""place"" or ""location"".
* The word ""perpetual"" is not a good translation of the Nepali word ""सदैव"" (sadāiv). The correct translation for this word is ""always"".
* The phrase ""journey"" is not a good translation of the Nepali word ""राहुले"" (rāhule). The correct translation for this word is ""Rahu"".

Reference Translation:

* The sentence structure is accurate. The reference translation maintains the original sentence structure of the Nepali sentence.
* The word ""place"" is a good translation of the Nepali word ""भावमा"" (bhāvamā).
* The word ""always"" is a good translation of the Nepali word ""सदैव"" (sadāiv).
* The phrase ""native of Dahichiure nature"" is a good translation of the Nepali word ""दहीचिउरे स्वभावको बनाइदिन्छ"" (dahīciure svabhāvako bhānāidinchi).

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation. The reference translation maintains the original sentence structure and uses more appropriate words to translate the Nepali words. The machine translation, on the other hand, changes the sentence structure and uses words that are not accurate translations of the Nepali words.

	* Reference translation: ""Jagat"" or ""Jagir"" is used correctly in the reference translation.
3. Idioms and expressions:

3. Accuracy: The machine translation makes a mistake in the spelling of Shakira's name. It uses ""Duscaljos"" instead of ""Descalzos"".
4. Fluency: The machine translation seems to struggle with the syntax of the sentence, especially in the name of the tour. It uses a lot of unnecessary words and phrases, such as ""under the name"" and ""first international journey"". The reference translation is more fluent and concise in its translation.
5. Cultural relevance: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the sentence. The name of Shakira's tour, ""Tour Pies Descalzos"", is a play on words in Spanish, which may not be immediately understandable to Nepali speakers. The reference translation captures this cultural nuance by using the correct name of the tour.

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation provides a clear and understandable translation of the source text.
* The translation is accurate in terms of grammar and vocabulary, with proper use of verb tenses and sentence structure.
* However, there are some minor errors in the translation, such as the use of ""red toothed"" instead of ""named as Red-caped Community"" for Ningmapa's followers, and ""yellow toothed"" instead of ""named Yellow-caped"" for Galocpa's followers.

Reference Translation:

1. Grammar: The machine translation has several grammatical errors, such as the use of ""the branch"" multiple times instead of ""the branches"" (singular vs. plural). The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the correct plural form of the word ""branches.""
2. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""gotra"" instead of ""gotras"" (the plural form of the word). Similarly, it uses ""pravar"" instead of ""pravaras"" (the plural form of the word). The reference translation, however, uses the correct plural forms of these words.
3. Accuracy: The machine translation seems to have mistranslated the word ""त्रिपाठीहरू"" (tripathi) as ""the goat."" In Nepali, ""tripathi"" refers to a gotra, which is a clan or lineage, and not a goat. The reference translation correctly translates ""tripathi"" as ""gotra.""
4. Fluency: The machine translation seems to struggle with the sentence structure and word order in Nepali. For example, the machine translation places the word ""the"" before ""branch"" in the second sentence, while in Nepali, the word ""the"" is usually placed after the noun.
5. Cultural nuances: The machine translation seems to lack cultural nuances and contextual understanding. For example, the word ""gotra"" is a term used in Nepali culture to refer to a clan or lineage, and it is not commonly used to refer to a goat.

Idioms and expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""that Samwe is the foundation of the song,"" while the reference translation uses ""the Sama Veda is the foundation of songs and music."" The reference translation uses a more common and idiomatic expression in Nepali, while the machine translation may not convey the same nuance of meaning.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the original Nepali sentence, placing ""Samwe"" before ""is"" in the second clause. In Nepali, the typical word order is to place the subject before the verb, so the reference translation maintains this word order.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation seems to have some errors in terms of word choice and grammar. For example, ""Samwe"" should be ""Sama Veda"" in the reference translation, and ""scholars"" should be ""scholars who have knowledge of the Vedas"" to make the sentence more accurate.

Overall, while the machine translation may be able to generate a coherent sentence, it lacks the nuance and accuracy of the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and conveys the meaning of the original Nepali sentence more accurately.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source Text: रुद्रहरू हनुमान सम्प्रदायको विकास हुनुपूर्व नै अस्तित्वमा आइसकेका थिए (The Rudras existed before the development of the Hanuman sect).
2. Machine Translation: The machine translation of the source text is ""The rudders came into existence during the development of Hanuman Prophet.""
3. Reference Translation: The reference translation of the source text is ""The Rudras existed before the development of the Hanuman sect.""

Comparison:

* The machine translation changes the word ""रुद्रहरू"" (Rudras) to ""rudders"" which is not accurate. ""Rudders"" refers to the flat, flat blades attached to a ship's stern that control its direction, while ""Rudras"" refers to a group of powerful deities in Hindu mythology.
* The machine translation also changes the word ""हनुमान"" (Hanuman) to ""Hanuman Prophet,"" which is not the correct translation. ""Hanuman"" is a popular Hindu deity and a character in the Hindu epic Ramayana, while ""Prophet"" is a title given to a person who is believed to have divine inspiration or insight.
* The machine translation also changes the word ""सम्प्रदाय"" (sect) to ""development,"" which is not the correct translation. ""सम्प्रदाय"" (sect) refers to a group of people who share similar beliefs, practices, or interests, while ""development"" refers to the process of creating or improving something.

Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the machine translation is not accurate in several places. The words ""rudders,"" ""Hanuman Prophet,"" and ""development"" are not the correct translations of the original Nepali words ""रुद्रहरू,"" ""हनुमान,"" and ""सम्प्रदाय,"" respectively. Therefore, the machine translation is not a good representation of the original text.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: In the machine translation, the name ""Vickie Guerrero"" is translated as ""Vickie Guerrero"" instead of ""Vicky Guerrero"" as in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall readability and accuracy of the translation.
2. Grammar: In the machine translation, the sentence structure is different from the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure with multiple clauses, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a clear subject-verb-object arrangement.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the original text. For example, the phrase ""acting general manager"" is not translated literally in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses the more common idiomatic expression ""general manager at Raw"".
4. Names and titles: The machine translation does not accurately translate the names and titles of the individuals involved. For example, ""Vickie Guerrero"" is translated as ""Vickie Guerrero"" instead of ""Vicky Guerrero"" in the reference translation.
5. Contextual understanding: The machine translation does not seem to have a good understanding of the context in which the sentence is used. For example, the machine translation does not recognize that ""rma"" is an abbreviation for ""Raw"" and does not translate it accordingly.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation in this case. The machine translation makes several errors in word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, names and titles, and contextual understanding. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more reliable and accurate translation of the original text.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""her"" to refer to Mandela, while the reference translation uses ""his."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the clarity and accuracy of the translation.
2. Tense consistency: The machine translation switches between the past and present tenses, while the reference translation maintains a consistent past tense throughout the sentence. For example, the machine translation uses ""happened"" in the first part of the sentence, but ""took place"" in the second part.
3. Word order: The machine translation rearranges the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""Evidence"" and ""that"" are placed closer together, while in the reference translation, they are separated by a comma.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""sufficient for her to understand her identity,"" which is not a natural or idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more common phrase ""sufficient to understand his identity.""
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""is"" in the third person singular form, while the reference translation uses the verb ""are"" in the plural form. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the clarity and accuracy of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation is more consistent in its use of verb tenses, word order, and idiomatic expressions, which makes it a more reliable and high-quality translation.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""saddle"" instead of ""saddles"" in the original Nepali sentence.
2. Grammar: The machine translation changes the grammatical structure of the sentence by converting the dual form ""two saddle management"" to the singular form ""one saddle National Council"".
3. Context: The reference translation provides additional context by mentioning the name of the player, Ambrose, and the year 2017, which is not present in the machine translation.
4. Fluency: The machine translation seems to struggle with the idiomatic expression ""next night of that game"" and replaces it with a more literal translation.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""saddles"" to ""saddle"", which is a common mistake in Nepali-English translation.

Machine Translation: ""Provided philosophical governance in the unity and organizational development of.""

Reference Translation: ""Provided ideological advice on the unity and organizational development.""

Here are the differences I found between the two translations:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""philosophical governance"" instead of ""ideological advice"". While ""philosophical"" does convey a sense of intellectual or philosophical guidance, it may not be the most accurate or idiomatic term in this context. In contrast, ""ideological advice"" is a more common and natural way to express the idea in English.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the passive voice in the main clause, which can make the sentence sound less natural in English. In the reference translation, the sentence is in the active voice, which is more common and natural in English.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""unity and organizational development"" which is a bit awkward and not a commonly used idiomatic expression in English. In contrast, the reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic phrase ""organizational growth"".
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""in the unity and organizational development"" comes after the verb ""provided"", while in the reference translation, it comes before the verb. This can affect the overall clarity and flow of the sentence.

Overall, while the machine translation is not incorrect, it does contain some differences in word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and word order compared to the reference translation. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation for this sentence.

This difference in word choice may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""gathered"" implies a more deliberate and planned action, while ""hungry"" conveys a sense of urgency and desperation.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the past tense of the verb ""gather"" (gathered) to describe the action of the mob, while the reference translation uses the present tense (hungry) to indicate the ongoing nature of the mob's action. This difference in grammar may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the past tense may suggest that the action of the mob is completed, while the present tense suggests that the action is ongoing.
3. Word order: The machine translation places the word ""soon"" before the verb ""went,"" while the reference translation places it after the verb. This difference in word order may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the word ""soon"" can indicate a sense of urgency or importance.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""marched to the castle of Bastille"" to describe the action of the mob, while the machine translation uses the literal translation of ""यसपछी हतियार भेला गर्ने"" (gathered weapons) to describe the action.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Hajjur has troubled us in my palace"" - The sentence structure is incorrect. It should be ""Hajjur has troubled us in my palace.""
	* Reference translation: ""You have blessed us by your presence here"" - The sentence structure is correct.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""and has requested mercy to tell the majority of hajjur's intentions"" - The word ""mercy"" is not used in the original Nepali sentence. The correct word in this context is ""please.""
	* Reference translation: ""Please tell us the main purpose of your arrival"" - The word ""please"" is used correctly in this sentence.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Hajjur's intentions"" - This is not a correct translation of the original Nepali phrase ""हजुरले मेरो राजसभामा पाउ कष्ट गरी हामीलाई धन्यधन्य तुल्याउनु भएको छ"" which means ""Hajjur has troubled us in my palace.""
	* Reference translation: ""the main purpose of your arrival"" - This is a more accurate translation of the original Nepali phrase, which refers to the reason or goal of Hajjur's visit to the palace.
4. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: ""Please tell us the majority of hajjur's intentions"" - The phrase ""majority of hajjur's intentions"" is not a correct translation of the original Nepali phrase. In Nepali culture, ""hajjur"" is a term of respect used to refer to an elder or a person of importance, so it is not appropriate to use the word ""majority"" in this context.
	* Reference translation: ""Please tell us the main purpose of your arrival"" - This translation is more culturally appropriate, as it acknowledges the respectful nature of the phrase ""hajjur"" and the importance of understanding the purpose of the person's visit.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and culturally appropriate than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence better, including the use of the term ""hajjur"" and the proper sentence structure.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""So the goddess of the blue berries can also be heard taking an avatar in every episode to destroy the underworld and defend the religion.""
	* Reference translation: ""Therefore, it is believed that Lord Vishnu of blue color takes incarnation in every age to destroy sin and protect religion.""

The machine translation uses the present tense ""can be heard"" instead of the past tense ""was believed"" in the reference translation. This is a grammatical error, as the sentence is describing a belief that is held in the past.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""goddess of the blue berries""
	* Reference translation: ""Lord Vishnu of blue color""

The machine translation uses the term ""goddess of the blue berries"" instead of ""Lord Vishnu of blue color"". This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""take an avatar""
	* Reference translation: ""takes incarnation""

The machine translation uses the term ""take an avatar"" which is not a common idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more common idiomatic expression ""takes incarnation"".

4. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: ""every episode to destroy the underworld and defend the religion.""
	* Reference translation: ""in every age to destroy sin and protect religion.""

The machine translation uses the term ""episode"" which is not a common term in Nepali. The reference translation uses the more common term ""age"" which is more appropriate in this context.

5. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: ""blue berries""
	* Reference translation: ""blue color""

The machine translation uses the term ""blue berries"" which is not a common term in Nepali. The reference translation uses the more common term ""blue color"" which is more appropriate in this context.

Overall, the machine translation has several errors in grammar, word choice, idiomatic expressions, fluency, and cultural nuances. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic in Nepali. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher rating in terms of quality compared to the machine translation.

2. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""candlestick"" instead of ""scandal"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""scandal"" implies a more serious and damaging event than ""candlestick"".
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""गिरिजाप्रसाद कोइराला"" (Girija Prasad Koirala) in the reference translation. This is a common idiomatic expression in Nepali, and its absence in the machine translation makes it sound less natural.
4. Tone: The machine translation has a more formal tone than the reference translation, which has a more conversational tone. The reference translation uses more colloquial language, such as ""मुछिए"" (muchhe) instead of ""involved in"".
5. Cultural references: The machine translation does not capture the cultural reference of ""काठमाडौंमा"" (Kathmandu) in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""Kathmandu"" is a cultural reference that is specific to Nepal.

3. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""sitting on the lap"" to convey the idea of someone sitting close to someone else, while the machine translation does not use any idiomatic expression.
4. Cultural nuances: The reference translation takes into account the cultural context of Nepali society, where it is common for people to sit on someone's lap as a sign of respect or affection. The machine translation does not consider this cultural nuance.
5. Fluency: The machine translation is less fluent than the reference translation. The machine translation uses more stilted language and does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation takes into account cultural nuances and uses more idiomatic expressions, while the machine translation is more formal and lacks fluency.

2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""died"" to indicate the time of Shivaji's death, while the reference translation uses the present tense ""died"" to indicate that Shivaji passed away after a three-week illness.
3. Preposition: In the machine translation, the preposition ""after"" is used to indicate the time of Shivaji's death, while in the reference translation, the preposition ""three-weeks"" is used to indicate the duration of his illness.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""insurance"" to translate the Nepali word ""पछि"" (pachi), which means ""illness"" or ""disease"". In the reference translation, the word ""illness"" is used to translate the same word.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""died"" in the third person singular form, while the reference translation uses the verb ""died"" in the third person plural form.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has made several errors in word choice, tense, and word order, which can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable translation of the Nepali sentence.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""तानाशाही"" (Tanashahi) is translated as ""government"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""Nepali Congress"" to translate the same term.
	* Reference translation: ""नेपाली कांग्रेस"" (Nepali Congress) is used in the reference translation to translate ""Nepali Congress"", which is a more accurate and common term used in Nepal.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the verb ""established"" in the past tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""establishes"" in the present tense.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the present tense to indicate that the Nepali Congress is an ongoing organization, while the machine translation uses the past tense to indicate that the establishment of the government is a completed action.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the phrase ""तानाशाही सरकारलाई"" (Tanashahi sarkarlai), which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. In Nepali, the phrase ""सरकार"" (sarkar) is used to refer to a government, and ""तानाशाही"" (Tanashahi) is not a commonly used term to refer to a government.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""हिम्मत गर्ने तरुणहरूले"" (Himmat garne tarunaharuule), which means ""the youths who dare to overthrow the dictatorial government as soon as possible"". This expression is more idiomatic and natural in Nepali than the machine translation.
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation includes multiple clauses and phrases, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural in Nepali than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more common and idiomatic expressions, and the sentence structure is simpler and more straightforward. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses less common terms and phrases, and the sentence structure is more complex and convoluted.

This is a significant difference, as ""balcony"" is not a common term in Nepali language, while ""bamboo bushes"" is a more accurate and common term used in Nepali to refer to the plant.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""takes birth"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""follows"" in the present tense. This difference in verb choice can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""takes birth"" implies a one-time event, while ""follows"" implies a continuous action.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""around the house"" in the reference translation. This expression is commonly used in Nepali to refer to the area around a person's home, and its inclusion in the reference translation helps to convey the intended meaning more accurately.
4. Cultural references: The machine translation uses the term ""balcony"" which is not a common term in Nepali culture, while the reference translation uses the term ""bamboo bushes"" which is a common term used in Nepali culture.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""relationship"" instead of ""retationship"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it does affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly. In the machine translation, the word ""relationship"" implies a more general connection between smoking and respiratory diseases, while ""retationship"" specifically refers to a connection or association between the two.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""This was the first relationship..."") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""This was the first retationship...""). This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame in which the connection between smoking and respiratory diseases was established.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the adjective ""first"" before the noun it modifies (""first relationship""), while the reference translation places it after the noun (""retationship between smoking and chronic respiratory disease""). This is a minor difference in word order, but it can affect the overall clarity of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""chronic respiratory disease"" instead of ""respiratory diseases"". This is a more natural and idiomatic way of expressing the idea in Nepali, as ""chronic"" is a commonly used term in Nepali to refer to a persistent or long-term condition.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation seems to have slightly mistranslated the word ""धुम्रपान"" (dhumrapan), which means ""smoking"" in Nepali. The machine translation renders it as ""this was the first relationship..."", while the reference translation correctly translates it as ""smoking and chronic respiratory disease"".

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, grammar, word order, idiomatic expressions, and accuracy. While the machine translation is generally understandable, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic in Nepali.

Machine Translation (MT): ""The same 'Raika command' is subdivided into 'Raika / Raika'.""

Reference Translation (RT): ""The same word 'Rai's order' has become 'Raika / Raeeka'.""

The main differences between the MT and RT are:

1. Word division: In the MT, the word ""Raika"" is divided into two separate words, ""Raika"" and ""Raika,"" whereas in the RT, it is combined into a single word ""Raika.""
2. Accentuation: In the MT, the word ""Raika"" is accented on the first syllable, whereas in the RT, it is accented on the second syllable.
3. Spelling: In the MT, the word ""Raika"" is spelled with an ""a"" in the middle, whereas in the RT, it is spelled with an ""e"" in the middle.
4. Contextualization: The MT uses the phrase ""Raika command"" to translate the Nepali word ""Rai's order,"" which may not be the most accurate or natural way to translate it in English. The RT uses the phrase ""Raika's order"" which is more contextually appropriate.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the MT has not produced an accurate or natural translation of the Nepali sentence. The RT, on the other hand, has provided a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation.

Overall, the quality of the MT for this sentence is poor, and it is not recommended for use in any context. The RT, on the other hand, is a more reliable and accurate translation that can be used with confidence.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""As well as stories, novels, nine of these were published by books.""
	* Reference translation: ""In addition, nine of his works were published including stories, novels, and poems.""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""stories, novels, nine of these"" which is a bit awkward and doesn't convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The reference translation uses the phrase ""including stories, novels, and poems"" which is more natural and accurate.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""साथै कथा, उपन्यास, कविता गरेर यिनका नौवटा कृति प्रकाशित भए.""
	* Reference translation: ""In addition, nine of his works were published including stories, novels, and poems.""

The machine translation uses the Nepali sentence structure, which is different from the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more standard English sentence structure, which is more clear and easier to read.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""नौवटा कृति प्रकाशित भए.""
	* Reference translation: ""In addition, nine of his works were published including stories, novels, and poems.""

The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""नौवटा कृति प्रकाशित भए"" which means ""nine of his works were published"" in Nepali. The reference translation uses a more natural and idiomatic expression in English.

4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""As well as stories, novels, nine of these were published by books.""
	* Reference translation: ""In addition, nine of his works were published including stories, novels, and poems.""

The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, which can make it harder to understand. The reference translation keeps the original word order in Nepali, which is more natural and easier to read.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more idiomatic and clear translation of the Nepali sentence, while the machine translation struggles to capture the nuances of the original sentence.

	* Reference translation: ""Normaly , it can be seen that the Sun visits the constellation in between 14 to 27 April every year""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a compound sentence with two independent clauses, while the reference translation uses a simple sentence with a subject and a verb.
4. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""visiting""
	* Reference translation: ""visits""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb ""visiting"", while the reference translation uses the verb ""visits"". Both verbs are valid in Nepali, but the reference translation is more idiomatic.
5. Cultural context:

	* Machine translation: ""Alienation"" is translated as ""discharge"" in the machine translation. However, ""alienation"" generally refers to a feeling of disconnection or estrangement, while ""discharge"" means to release or remove something from a system. In this context, ""alienation"" might be a better choice to convey the idea of feeling disconnected from society or culture.
2. Immorality vs. Violence:
	* Machine translation: ""Immorality"" is translated as ""violence"" in the machine translation. While ""immorality"" can refer to a lack of moral principles or values, ""violence"" typically refers to physical or verbal aggression towards others. In this context, ""immorality"" might be a better choice to convey the idea of a lack of moral values or principles.
3. Rebellion vs. Creativity:
	* Machine translation: ""Rebellion"" is translated as ""creativity"" in the machine translation. While ""rebellion"" refers to a defiant or resistant attitude towards authority or tradition, ""creativity"" refers to the ability to generate new and original ideas. In this context, ""rebellion"" might be a better choice to convey the idea of challenging societal norms or expectations.
4. Virtue vs. Nature Love:
	* Machine translation: ""Virtue"" is translated as ""nature love"" in the machine translation. While ""virtue"" refers to moral excellence or goodness, ""nature love"" is a term that is not commonly used in English. In this context, ""virtue"" might be a better choice to convey the idea of moral excellence or goodness.
5. Artificiality vs. Emotion:
	* Machine translation: ""Artificiality"" is translated as ""emotion"" in the machine translation. While ""artificiality"" refers to something that is man-made or fake, ""emotion"" refers to a feeling or attitude towards something. In this context, ""artificiality"" might be a better choice to convey the idea of something that is not genuine or authentic.
6. Salvation vs. Pseudoscience:
	* Machine translation: ""Salvation"" is translated as ""pseudoscience"" in the machine translation. While ""salvation"" refers to deliverance or rescue from a dangerous or difficult situation, ""pseudoscience"" refers to false or misleading claims that are presented as scientific. In this context, ""salvation"" might be a better choice to convey the idea of deliverance or rescue from false or misleading beliefs.

Overall, the machine translation does not always accurately convey the meaning of the original Nepali text. The translation often uses words that are not idiomatic or culturally appropriate, which can result in a loss of meaning or context. Therefore, I would recommend using a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation, such as the reference translation provided.

	* Machine translation: ""best needed"" (should be ""best be"")
	* Reference translation: ""power should be"" (correct)
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""no one is"" (should be ""no one is in"")
	* Reference translation: ""hands of a person or institution"" (correct)
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: "" seventh people"" (should be ""common people"")
	* Reference translation: ""people"" (correct)
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""in the hands of the seventh people"" (should be ""the hands of the common people"")
	* Reference translation: ""hands of the people"" (correct)
5. Tone:
	* Machine translation: ""strong believer"" (should be ""firmly believed"")
	* Reference translation: ""firmly believed"" (correct)

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation has some errors in word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and word order. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and natural-sounding. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further translation work.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""So if the boy who is paraphrased by another marriage"" - The sentence structure is awkward and unnatural. It should be ""So if a boy who is divorced and remarries...""
	* Reference translation: ""If a divorced boy or girl remarries..."" - This sentence structure is more natural and idiomatic in Nepali.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""the society doesn't look at her hatred"" - The word ""hatred"" is not commonly used in Nepali. A more accurate translation would be ""the society doesn't look at her with hate"" or ""the society doesn't view her with hostility.""
	* Reference translation: ""society does not look them with hate"" - This translation is more accurate and natural in Nepali.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""the society doesn't look at her hatred"" - The idiomatic expression in Nepali is ""the society doesn't look at them with hate"" or ""the society doesn't view them with hostility.""
	* Reference translation: ""If a divorced boy or girl remarries..."" - This translation is more accurate and natural in Nepali.
4. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: ""So if the boy who is paraphrased by another marriage"" - The phrase ""paraphrased by another marriage"" is not commonly used in Nepali. A more accurate translation would be ""So if a divorced boy or girl remarries...""
	* Reference translation: ""If a divorced boy or girl remarries..."" - This translation is more accurate and natural in Nepali.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural in Nepali compared to the machine translation. The reference translation captures the cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions of the Nepali language more accurately, making it a better translation of the original text.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""Summer East"" are placed together, while in the reference translation, they are separated by a conjunction.
2. Use of articles: The machine translation uses the indefinite article ""a"" before ""Summer East"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""Summer East"" in the first instance and ""a"" in the second instance.
3. Number agreement: The machine translation has a different number agreement than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the number ""2"" is used in both instances, while in the reference translation, the number ""2"" is used in the first instance and ""2 NO."" in the second instance.
4. Tense: The machine translation has a different tense than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the verb tenses are consistent throughout the sentence, while in the reference translation, the verb tense changes from past to present.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""then"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses the word ""upto"" in the second instance.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has made several errors in word order, article usage, number agreement, tense, and word choice. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""carrying flags"" ( Flag चाहेटेका प्रभाव रहेकै कारण )
	* Reference translation: ""carrying the flag"" ( झण्डा नै बोकेर हिँडेको पाइन्छि )
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""flags"" ( Flag चाहेटेका ), while the reference translation uses the word ""the flag"" ( झण्डा ). This difference may not have a significant impact on the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does show that the machine translation is not able to accurately translate every word.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""the analysis of the principle that the characters are carrying flags has also been indicated"" ( देवकोटाका उपन्यासमा राजनीतिको गहिरो प्रभाव रहेकै कारण पात्रहरू झण्डा नै बोकेर हिँडेको पाइन्छि भन्ने प्रधानको विश्लेषण पनि औचित्यपूर्ण रहेको छ )
	* Reference translation: ""Pradhan 's analysis that the characters are found carrying the flag because of the deep influence of politics in Devkota 's novel is also justified"" ( प्रधानको विश्लेषण भन्ने पाइन्छि भन्ने प्रधानको विश्लेषण पनि औचित्यपूर्ण रहेको छ )
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure, with a more direct translation of the meaning.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""carrying flags"" ( Flag चाहेटेका प्रभाव रहेकै कारण )
	* Reference translation: ""carrying the flag"" ( झण्डा नै बोकेर हिँडेको पाइन्छि )
	* Difference: The machine translation does not accurately translate the idiomatic expression ""carrying the flag"" ( झण्डा ), which is a common expression in Nepali.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""the deep influence of politics"" ( राजनीतिको गहिरो प्रभाव )
	* Reference translation: ""the politics of the novel"" ( नव्या का राजनीति )
	* Difference: The machine translation does not accurately translate the cultural reference ""the politics of the novel"" ( नव्या का राजनीति ), which is a specific term used in Nepali to refer to the political themes or ideas present in a novel.

Overall, the machine translation does not accurately capture the nuances of the original Nepali sentence, and the reference translation provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the meaning.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""राज्यमा"" (state) should be translated as ""state"" or ""country"" depending on the context, but the machine translation uses ""nation"" which is not accurate.
	* Reference translation: ""state"" is used consistently throughout the translation.
3. Punctuation:
	* Machine translation: There is a missing comma after ""Delhi"" in the machine translation, which can make the sentence difficult to read and understand.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation includes a comma after ""Delhi"" to separate the two independent clauses.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""best in the nation after Delhi"" which is a common way to express the idea of being the second-best in a particular category.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""best in the country after Delhi"" which is more natural and idiomatic in Nepali.
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The sentence structure and word choice in the machine translation are less natural and may sound awkward to a native Nepali speaker.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation has a more natural flow and is easier to read and understand.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""nation"" instead of ""Janajati"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""Janajati"" refers specifically to the indigenous people of Nepal, while ""nation"" is a more general term that can refer to any country or group of people.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""our society has"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""the people who don't wear Janai have been categorized""). This difference in verb tense may not be significant in this context, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""union of the peoples"" which is not a common idiomatic expression in Nepali. In Nepali, the phrase ""janai"" is used to refer to the indigenous people, and ""Janajati"" is the term used to refer to them collectively.
4. Cultural context: The reference translation takes into account the cultural context of the sentence, as ""Janai"" is a term that holds significant cultural and historical importance in Nepal. The machine translation, on the other hand, may not fully understand the cultural context of the term and its significance in Nepali society.
5. Fluency: The machine translation may not be as fluent or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation uses more idiomatic expressions and phrasing that is more common in Nepali language.

Based on these differences, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, culturally sensitive, and natural-sounding, while the machine translation is more literal and may not fully capture the nuances of the Nepali language.

Machine Translation:

* The word ""Patriarch"" is translated as ""पितृसत्ता"" in Nepali, which is a direct translation of the English word.
* The phrase ""or matriarch"" is not translated in Nepali, as the word ""मातृसत्ता"" is used instead.
* The sentence structure is simple and straightforward, with no attempt to convey the nuances of the original English sentence.

Reference Translation:

* The word ""Patriarch"" is translated as ""पाटृसत्ता"" in Nepali, which is a more accurate translation of the English word.
* The phrase ""or matriarch"" is translated as ""यसका तीन विभिन्न पाटृसत्ताहरुमा"" in Nepali, which conveys the idea of three different types of patriarchs.
* The sentence structure is more complex and nuanced, with the use of the phrase ""तीन विभिन्न"" to indicate the different types of patriarchs.

Comparison:

* Both translations accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence, but the reference translation provides more context and nuance.
* The machine translation is more direct and straightforward, while the reference translation is more complex and nuanced.
* The reference translation uses more Nepali words and phrases, which makes it more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Nepali.

Overall, while both translations are accurate, the reference translation provides a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the original English sentence. The use of more Nepali words and phrases also makes it more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Nepali.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""And Hanuman exceeded the sea"" (मानु समुदार परेको)
	* Reference translation: ""Then, Hanuman committed to jump the ocean"" (तब हनुमानले समुदार परेको)

The machine translation uses the word ""exceeded"" (परेको), which is a more formal and literal translation of the Nepali word ""परेको"" (parēko). However, the reference translation uses the phrase ""committed to jump"" (परेको), which is a more idiomatic and natural way to express the idea in English.

2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""and found Zita"" (त हनुमानले सिता भेटेर आउने)
	* Reference translation: ""and return after meeting Sita"" (त हनुमानले सिता सम्मेत आउने)

The machine translation uses the present tense ""found"" (भेटेर), which doesn't accurately convey the idea of Hanuman's journey in the reference translation, which uses the past tense ""return"" (आउने) to indicate that Hanuman had already met Sita before returning.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Hanuman exceeded the sea, and found Zita"" (हनुमान समुदार परेको, त हनुमानले सिता भेटेर आउने)
	* Reference translation: ""Then, Hanuman jumped the ocean and met Sita"" (त हनुमानले समुदार परेको, त हनुमानले सिता सम्मेत आउने)

The machine translation uses a different word order than the reference translation, which can make the sentence sound less natural in English. In the machine translation, the words ""Hanuman"" and ""exceeded"" are separated by a comma, while in the reference translation, they are closer together in the sentence.

4. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""And Hanuman exceeded the sea"" (त हनुमानले समुदार परेको)
	* Reference translation: ""Then, Hanuman committed to jump the ocean"" (त हनुमानले समुदार परेको)

The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expressions used in the reference translation, such as ""committed to jump"" (परेको) instead of ""exceeded"" (परेको). These expressions are important for conveying the intended meaning and context of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation has some errors and inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more natural and accurate English translation of the Nepali sentence.

	* Machine translation: ""Lately, his analysis from the angle of ideal flow and eastern vision has been incomplete.""
	* Reference translation: ""Therefore, his analysis from the angle of the flow of thought and Eastern philosophy is incomplete.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the present perfect tense (""has been incomplete"") while the reference translation uses the present simple tense (""is incomplete""). The present perfect tense is more appropriate in this context as it emphasizes the completion of the analysis at some point in the past, while the present simple tense suggests that the analysis is still incomplete.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""ideal flow""
	* Reference translation: ""flow of thought""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the term ""ideal flow"" which is not a common term in Nepali. The reference translation uses the more appropriate term ""flow of thought"" which is a common term in Nepali.
3. Idiomatic expressions:

5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""texted"" which is not a common word in Nepali. In Nepali, the word ""पाठ गर्नु"" (paath garne) is used to indicate that something is being read or studied.

Overall, the machine translation has several errors and inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic in Nepali, and it better conveys the meaning of the original sentence.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Machine translation: ""He has studied the structural theory of this novel, with the introduction of the codex.""
	* Reference translation: ""He has done a structural study of this novel including the introduction of Devkota.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the term ""codex"" which is not a commonly used term in Nepali language. In Nepali, the term ""Devkota"" is used to refer to the famous Nepali poet, Laxmi Prasad Devkota. The reference translation correctly uses the term ""Devkota"" to refer to the poet.
2. Machine translation: ""this novel"" is not capitalized in the machine translation.
	* Reference translation: ""this novel"" is capitalized in the reference translation.
	* Difference: The machine translation does not capitalize the word ""novel"" which is a proper noun in Nepali.
3. Machine translation: The verb tenses are not consistent in the machine translation.
	* Machine translation: ""has studied"" (past tense)
	* Reference translation: ""has done"" (present tense)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the past tense ""has studied"" to describe the action of the subject, while the reference translation uses the present tense ""has done"" to indicate that the action of the subject is ongoing or completed.
4. Machine translation: The word order is different in the machine translation.
	* Machine translation: ""the structural theory of this novel, with the introduction of the codex.""
	* Reference translation: ""including the introduction of Devkota, he has done a structural study of this novel.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a different word order to convey the same meaning. The reference translation places the subject ""he"" before the verb ""has done"" to make the sentence more clear and concise.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not of high quality. The reference translation provides a more accurate and natural-sounding translation of the Nepali sentence. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further translation work.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""standing supporters"" instead of ""standing supporters of the opponent Blackburn Rovers FC"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it does affect the clarity of the sentence slightly.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the past tense ""was honoured"" instead of the present perfect ""has been honored"" in the reference translation. This is a more significant difference, as it affects the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""replaced him in the game"" instead of ""replaced him in November"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it does affect the naturalness of the sentence.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation gets the name of the football club wrong, referring to it as ""Blackburn Rowers fc"" instead of ""Blackburn Rovers FC"". This is a significant difference, as it affects the accuracy of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural as the reference translation. The reference translation uses more formal language and gets the names and tenses correct, making it a better translation. However, the machine translation is still usable for basic communication purposes, but it may not be suitable for formal or professional contexts.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""middle Indian Hindu"" instead of ""Central Indian Hindu"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are considered"") instead of the past tense (""were believed"") in the reference translation. This is a more common and natural way of expressing the idea in English, but it may not be as accurate in this specific context.
3. Phrasing: The machine translation uses the phrase ""especially based on"" instead of ""believed to be based on"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference in phrasing, but it may affect the overall clarity of the sentence.
4. Names: The machine translation uses the spelling ""Marichi"" instead of ""Marichi"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it may affect the accuracy of the translation.
5. Word order: The machine translation reverses the order of the names of the sages in the reference translation, listing them in the order ""Vashishta, Angira, Atri, and Marichi"" instead of ""Atri, Vashishta, Angira, and Marichi"". This is a more significant difference, as the order of the names can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
6. Translation of key terms: The machine translation uses the term ""gotra"" instead of ""tribal systems"" in the reference translation. While ""gotra"" can refer to a clan or lineage in Hinduism, it may not be the most accurate term to use in this context, as the reference translation specifically refers to ""tribal traditions"".

Overall, the machine translation makes several minor errors and omissions, and the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding in English. However, it's worth noting that the quality of machine translations can vary depending on the complexity and nuance of the source text, and in this case, the differences between the two translations are relatively minor.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""sons"" instead of ""children"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""said"") to indicate the Taliban's statement, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""were targeted""). This difference in tense is due to the fact that the machine translation is generating the translation in real-time, whereas the reference translation is a pre-translated text.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""the sons of a military officer"" comes before ""who was on the black list,"" while in the reference translation, the phrase ""who was on the black list"" comes before ""the sons of a military officer."" This difference in word order can affect the emphasis and clarity of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""on the black list"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the naturalness and fluency of the translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""said"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""were targeted"" in the past tense. This difference in verb tense is due to the fact that the machine translation is generating the translation in real-time, whereas the reference translation is a pre-translated text.
6. Cultural references: The machine translation does not include the cultural reference to ""pesawar"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the accuracy and cultural relevance of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, tense, word order, idiomatic expressions, grammar, and cultural references. While the machine translation is generally understandable, it may not be as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the primary source for accuracy and clarity.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Influential and mental illnesses must travel to 15 days for knowledge or molecular obligations."" - The sentence structure is awkward and the use of ""influential"" and ""mental illnesses"" is incorrect.
	* Reference translation: ""One has to travel for 15 days to cure incurable physical and mental diseases and to attain knowledge or salvation."" - The sentence structure is better and the use of ""incurable physical and mental diseases"" is more accurate.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""must travel"" - The verb tense is incorrect, it should be ""have to travel"" or ""must travel"".
	* Reference translation: ""have to travel"" - The verb tense is correct.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""molecular obligations"" - This is not a common or accurate term in Nepali, it should be ""physical or mental diseases"".
	* Reference translation: ""physical or mental diseases"" - This is a more accurate and common term in Nepali.
4. Cultural and contextual accuracy:
	* Machine translation: The phrase ""influential and mental illnesses"" is not a common or accurate term in Nepali, it should be ""physical or mental diseases"".
	* Reference translation: The phrase ""cure incurable physical and mental diseases"" is more culturally and contextually accurate in Nepali, as the concept of ""incurable diseases"" is more widely accepted and understood in Nepali culture.
5. Fluency:

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is fuelled"" instead of the past tense ""got"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""the new idia"" comes before ""fuelled the perception of magnetic fields"", while in the reference translation, ""he got a new idie"" comes before ""fuelled the perception of magnetic fields"". This can make the sentence harder to understand.
4. Meaning: The machine translation seems to change the meaning of the sentence slightly compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, it seems that the new idea or concept is fueling the perception of magnetic fields, while in the reference translation, it's the new idie (which is not a commonly used term in Nepali) that is fueling the perception of magnetic fields.

Overall, the machine translation seems to have some errors in word choice, grammar, and meaning compared to the reference translation. It's important to double-check machine translations to ensure that they are accurate and convey the intended meaning.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""convenience"" instead of ""privilege"" in the reference translation. ""Convenience"" is a more general term that could refer to any advantage or benefit, whereas ""privilege"" specifically implies a special advantage or right granted to a particular individual or group.
2. Tense consistency: The machine translation switches between past and present tenses, which can make the sentence sound awkward. For example, ""had taken"" in the machine translation is in the past tense, but ""had already been"" in the reference translation is in the present perfect tense. In general, it's better to use consistent tense throughout the sentence to improve clarity.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the verb ""had taken"" at the end of the sentence, which can make the sentence sound less clear and more awkward. In the reference translation, the verb is placed earlier in the sentence, which improves the flow and clarity of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't quite capture the idiomatic expression ""माओवादी शान्तिप्रक्रियामा"" (Maoist peace process) in the reference translation. This is a common expression used in Nepali to refer to the peace process initiated by the Maoist party.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""fellow"" instead of ""God"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""fellow"" does not have the same connotation as ""God"" in Nepali culture. In Nepali, ""God"" is often referred to as ""Ishwar"" or ""Bhagavan,"" while ""fellow"" is a more informal term that can refer to a friend or companion.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense. In Nepali, the past tense is often used to indicate a completed action, while the present tense is used to indicate a general truth or a habitual action.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""substantial developments"" instead of the more common Nepali idiom ""उपर्युक्त विकारहरु"" (uparukta vikaaraharu). This idiom is commonly used in Nepali to refer to any kind of obstacle or difficulty that needs to be overcome.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""if"" at the beginning of the sentence instead of at the end. In Nepali, the word order is typically SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), so the sentence should read ""If we can free ourselves from the above disorders, we can easily attain God.""
5. Fluency: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The sentence structure is awkward, and the word choices are not as natural as they could be.

The machine translation uses the verb ""uttered"" to translate the Nepali word ""थिए"" (thiye), which is a verb that means ""to say"" or ""to speak"". However, in this context, it seems more appropriate to translate it as a noun, ""Bhatta"", which is the name of the ancestor.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""the fathers of the reservation"" (noun phrase)
	* Reference translation: ""the ancestors of Sanjyal"" (noun phrase)

The machine translation uses the phrase ""the fathers of the reservation"" to translate the Nepali phrase ""सञ्ज्यालका पुर्खा भट्ट"" (Sanjyalako purkha Bhatta), which means ""the ancestors of Sanjyal"". However, in this context, it seems more appropriate to translate it as ""the ancestors of Sanjyal"" to make the sentence more clear and concise.

3. Idiomatic expressions:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""private levels"" instead of ""private sector"" or ""private companies."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tense: The machine translation is in the past tense (""had given""), while the reference translation is in the present tense (""allowed""). This difference is due to the fact that the machine translation is based on a pre-existing translation, which may not have been updated to reflect current tense usage.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""controlled by American negotiators,"" which is not a common idiomatic expression in Nepali. In Nepali, it would be more common to say ""controlled by US corporations"" or ""under US control.""
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""given"" in the passive voice, which may not be the most natural choice in Nepali. In Nepali, the verb ""give"" is more commonly used in the active voice, as in ""the government gave private sector status to the oil industries.""

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, tense, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. However, it is important to note that machine translation is a complex task and can be affected by many factors, including the quality of the training data and the complexity of the source language.

Machine Translation:

* ""Samweed has an 1875 mechanism that can be read from luggage and dull speed.""

Reference Translation:

* ""There are 1875 mantras in Sama Veda that can be read in short and slow pace.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""mechanism"" to translate ""मन्त्र"" (mantra), which is not a common term in English. In the reference translation, the word ""mantras"" is used, which is more appropriate.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""can be read"" to translate ""पढ्न सकिने"" (padee sakine), which is incorrect. The correct translation would be ""can be read"" or ""are read"".
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""dull speed"" to translate ""लघु तथा मन्द"" (lugu tatha mand), which is not a common idiomatic expression in English. In the reference translation, the phrase ""short and slow pace"" is used, which is more idiomatic and easier to understand.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation gets the number of mantras wrong, translating it as ""1875 mechanism"" instead of ""1875 mantras"".

Overall, the machine translation is not very accurate and does not convey the intended meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and idiomatic, making it a better choice for communication purposes.

1. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, moving ""By"" to the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation keeps the original word order.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""must be collected"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""should be studied and materials should be collected"").
3. Modality: The machine translation uses the modal verb ""must"" to indicate obligation, while the reference translation uses ""should"" to indicate a recommendation or suggestion.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""materials"" instead of ""literature"" in the reference translation.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""By bearing this in mind"" in the reference translation.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence, including the idiomatic expression and the subtle difference in tone.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""sons"" (माथि) instead of ""common people"" (जनसाधारणका) in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense (""since 1958"") while the reference translation uses the present tense (""since 1958""). This difference in tense does not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence, but it can make the translation sound more natural or formal depending on the context.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the word ""that"" (यसमा) at the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation places it after the verb ""was"" (पनि प्रवेश). This difference in word order can affect the emphasis and structure of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""church that was also entrusted to the sons of the junior"" (संस्थान भइसकेको छ ।), which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic expression ""admitted in it"" (यसमा जनसाधारणका छोराहरुलाई प्रवेश दिइएको चर्चा माथि नै भइसकेको छ).
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""entrusted"" (भइसकेको) in the passive voice, while the reference translation uses the active voice with the verb ""admitted"" (प्रवेश दिइएको). This difference in grammar can affect the clarity and naturalness of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, tense, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. While the machine translation is understandable, it may not be as natural or accurate as the reference translation in some cases.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""betrayal"" instead of ""importance"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""betrayal"" implies a negative connotation, while ""importance"" conveys a positive one.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is"") in ""There is as much significance of the akkadian third"" instead of the past tense (""was"") in the reference translation. This change in verb tense can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order in the second sentence, placing ""as there is"" at the beginning of the sentence instead of ""the day of Ekadashi"". This can make the sentence sound less natural and less clear.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""Ekadashi fast"" in the reference translation. This expression is commonly used in Nepali to refer to the fast observed on the eleventh day of the lunar fortnight.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation seems to have misinterpreted the word ""Ekadashi"" in the source text. In Nepali, ""Ekadashi"" refers to the eleventh day of the lunar fortnight, but the machine translation translates it as ""akkadian third"". This is a significant error, as ""akkadian"" is not a Nepali word and does not refer to the same concept as ""Ekadashi"".

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""discovered"" instead of the past tense ""discovered"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses the word ""chai"" instead of ""stupa"" in the reference translation. ""Chai"" is a Nepali word for tea, but ""stupa"" is the correct term for a Buddhist monument.
4. Sentence structure: The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with multiple clauses, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence with a single clause.
5. Cultural context: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the original sentence. For example, ""malmal"" is a Nepali word for muslin cloth, but it is also a term used to describe a type of cloth that is traditionally used in Nepal.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given source:

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation uses the word ""virtue"" instead of ""implication"" to translate the Nepali word ""भाव"" (bhava). This is a common mistake, as ""भाव"" can have multiple meanings depending on the context, and ""virtue"" may not be the most appropriate choice in this case.
* The machine translation uses the word ""devil"" instead of ""devotion"" to translate the Nepali word ""भक्ति"" (bhakti). This is also a common mistake, as ""भक्ति"" can refer to a variety of concepts, including devotion, faith, and spiritual practice.
* The machine translation uses the word ""cannot"" instead of ""cannot be damaged"" to translate the Nepali phrase ""पनि केही बिगार्न सक्दैन"" (pani kehi bigarne sakdain). This is a minor mistake, as the correct translation of this phrase is more nuanced and requires a better understanding of the context.

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation uses the word ""implication"" to translate the Nepali word ""भाव"" (bhava), which is a more accurate choice in this case, as the word ""भाव"" can indeed imply or suggest something.
* The reference translation uses the word ""devotion"" to translate the Nepali word ""भक्ति"" (bhakti), which is a more accurate choice in this case, as ""भक्ति"" can refer to a deep and sincere devotion or faith.
* The reference translation uses the phrase ""cannot be damaged"" to translate the Nepali phrase ""पनि केही बिगार्न सक्दैन"" (pani kehi bigarne sakdain), which is a more accurate choice in this case, as the phrase is meant to convey the idea that even an evil planet cannot harm something that is protected by devotion.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and nuanced than the machine translation, as it takes into account the context and the multiple meanings of the Nepali words involved. However, both translations have their limitations, and a more detailed and context-specific analysis may be necessary to produce a high-quality translation.

1. Tone: The machine translation has a more negative tone than the reference translation. While the machine translation uses the word ""collapsed,"" which has a more negative connotation, the reference translation uses the word ""easy,"" which has a more positive connotation.
2. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""campus"" in the source sentence, but the reference translation uses ""this campus."" The reference translation also uses the word ""getting"" instead of ""After the establishment of this campus.""
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present perfect tense (""have collapsed"") in the source sentence, while the reference translation uses the simple past tense (""became"").
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions in the source sentence, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""very easy.""
5. Fluency: The machine translation seems to have some difficulty with the sentence structure and word order, as it uses a more complex sentence structure than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses ""After the establishment of this campus"" instead of ""After the establishment of this campus.""

Overall, the reference translation seems to be more accurate and fluent than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the meaning of the source sentence more clearly and uses more appropriate language for a native English speaker. The machine translation, on the other hand, seems to struggle with the sentence structure and word choice, resulting in a less accurate and less fluent translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word-for-word differences:
	* Machine translation: ""यस्तो प्रतिज्ञा"" (yasto pratijña) vs. Reference translation: ""Indra"" (Indra)
	* Machine translation: ""गरेर"" (gare) vs. Reference translation: ""tent"" (tent)
	* Machine translation: ""ईन्द्र"" (Indra) vs. Reference translation: ""wedding tent"" (wedding tent)
2. Grammar and sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""By this promise the moon went out of the wedding stable."" vs. Reference translation: ""By this promise the Indra went out of the wedding tent.""
	* The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense (past tense instead of past perfect) and the wrong subject-verb agreement (the subject is ""moon"" but the verb is in the third person singular) in the first sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""By this promise the moon went out of the wedding stable."" vs. Reference translation: ""By this promise the Indra went out of the wedding tent.""
	* The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""Indra went out of the wedding tent"" in Nepali culture, which is used to describe someone leaving a wedding ceremony.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""moon"" vs. Reference translation: ""Indra""
	* The machine translation uses a different deity than the reference translation, which is more culturally appropriate for a Nepali wedding ceremony.
5. Fluency and naturalness:
	* Machine translation: ""By this promise the moon went out of the wedding stable."" vs. Reference translation: ""By this promise the Indra went out of the wedding tent.""
	* The reference translation sounds more natural and fluent in Nepali, while the machine translation sounds awkward and unnatural.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, vocabulary, and cultural references, which can affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the translation. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and culturally appropriate translation of the given Nepali sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation:

* The sentence structure is not accurate. It should be ""After the end of the child, its symbol is formed."" (Passive voice)
* The word ""its"" is incorrect. It should be ""the"" before ""symbol"".
* The word ""abolition"" is not a Nepali word, it should be ""Ihi"" (a traditional Nepali practice of post-menopausal women)

Reference Translation:

* The sentence structure is accurate.
* The word ""its"" is correct.
* The word ""abolition"" is replaced with ""Ihi"", which is the correct term in Nepali.

Comparison:

* The machine translation is not accurate in terms of sentence structure, word choice, and grammar.
* The reference translation is more accurate in terms of sentence structure, word choice, and grammar.

Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the reference translation is more accurate and of higher quality compared to the machine translation. The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Nepali sentence, while the machine translation contains errors in sentence structure, word choice, and grammar. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable option for Nepali-English translation.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""There were"" are placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, they are placed after the verb ""involved.""
2. Tense: The machine translation is in the past tense, while the reference translation is in the present tense. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with tense consistency.
3. Number agreement: The machine translation agrees with the number of the subject ""shops"" in the singular, while the reference translation agrees with the number in the plural. This is a common error in machine translations, as they often struggle with number agreement.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""shoes"" instead of ""shows"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
5. Grammar: The machine translation has a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more simplified sentence structure, with a subject-verb-object word order, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with a subject-verb-object-complement word order.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, tense, number agreement, word choice, and grammar. The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Nepali, while the machine translation sounds more stilted and unnatural.

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is also prominent"") instead of the past tense (""was also prominent"") in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order in the sentence, placing ""cow's milk"" after ""worshiping"" instead of before it. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less clear.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""offering cow 's milk"" in the reference translation. This is a common error in machine translations, as they often struggle to recognize and translate idiomatic expressions accurately.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation does not recognize the cultural reference to ""Masta"" as a deity, which is a significant error. Masta is a popular deity in Nepalese culture, and it is important to recognize and translate cultural references accurately in translations.

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense. This is because the reference translation is translating a sentence in the past tense in Nepali.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""considered to be,"" which is a more formal and literal translation of the Nepali phrase ""एक मानिन्छ."" The reference translation uses the more idiomatic expression ""considered as one of the ancient feminists.""
4. Gender: The machine translation uses the masculine pronoun ""he"" to refer to the woman, while the reference translation uses the feminine pronoun ""she."" This is a significant difference, as it reflects the gendered nature of the original Nepali sentence.
5. Cultural context: The machine translation does not provide any cultural context for the term ""ancient narrators,"" while the reference translation provides a cultural context by referring to the woman as a ""feminist.""

The machine translation uses the present perfect tense (""has been shot"") to indicate that the action of being shot occurred before the present moment, while the reference translation uses the past simple tense (""raided"") to indicate that the action of raiding the house occurred in the past.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""घर"" (home)
	* Reference translation: ""house""

The machine translation uses the Nepali word ""घर"" (home), while the reference translation uses the English word ""house"".

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""पुन्ना पुण्यतिथिमा"" (last half of the mother's funeral)
	* Reference translation: ""mother 's last death anniversary""

The machine translation uses a Nepali idiomatic expression ""पुन्ना पुण्यतिथिमा"" (last half of the mother's funeral), which may not be easily understandable for non-Nepali speakers. The reference translation uses a more straightforward and idiomatic English expression ""mother 's last death anniversary"".

4. Sentence structure:

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the word order is different than in the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""Brazil defeated"" comes first, while in the reference translation, it is ""In the third game of Group G, Brazil defeated."" This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with word order and sentence structure.
2. Use of articles: In the machine translation, the article ""a"" is used before ""Ivoricost,"" while in the reference translation, no article is used. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Spelling: In the machine translation, the word ""Ivoricost"" is spelled incorrectly as ""Ivory Cost."" This is a significant difference, as it can change the meaning of the sentence entirely.
4. Grammar: In the machine translation, the verb tense is inconsistent. The sentence ""Brazil defeated"" is in the past tense, while the verb ""defeated"" should be in the past participle form to match the tense of the rest of the sentence. In the reference translation, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence.
5. Idiomatic expressions: In the machine translation, the phrase ""ब्राजिलले आइभोरिकोस्टलाई"" is translated as ""Brazil defeated,"" which is not a natural or idiomatic expression in English. In the reference translation, the phrase ""Group G"" is used, which is a more common and idiomatic way to refer to a group of teams in a tournament.

Overall, the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation in terms of word order, spelling, grammar, and idiomatic expressions.

3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense verb form ""manages"" instead of the past tense verb form ""managed"" in the reference translation.
4. Idiomatic expression: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""Dhami of Birjaya"" in the reference translation, which is a common way of referring to a village headman or leader in Nepal.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence, which is that the second son becomes the headman of a village called Birjaya.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the original sentence. The reference translation provides a more natural and idiomatic expression of the sentence in English, while the machine translation falls short in terms of word choice, spelling, grammar, and accuracy.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""wipe out"" instead of ""sell"" in the reference translation. ""Wipe out"" means to completely eliminate or remove something, while ""sell"" means to transfer ownership of something to another person or entity for a price. In this context, the reference translation uses the more appropriate word choice to convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence.
2. Number agreement: In the machine translation, the verb ""became"" is in the singular form, while in the reference translation, it is in the plural form. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation.
3. Tense consistency: The machine translation uses the present tense in both ""Britney also became"" and ""more than one million in the country,"" while the reference translation uses the past tense in ""sold more than 100,000 copies."" This inconsistency in tense can make the translation sound less natural and less accurate.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions in the translation, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""sell more than 100,000 copies"" to convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence. Idiomatic expressions are important in translation to ensure that the meaning of the source text is accurately conveyed in the target language.
5. Grammar: The machine translation has a grammatical error in the sentence ""Britney also became a young female artist."" The phrase ""young female artist"" should be in the singular form, as ""Britney"" is a single person. The reference translation corrects this error by using the singular form of the phrase.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more appropriate word choices, maintains tense consistency, and includes idiomatic expressions to convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence more effectively.

Machine Translation:

* ""The clothes are like brains"" - This translation is incorrect. The word ""brain"" doesn't exist in Nepali, and the correct word for ""clothes"" is ""लुगा"" (lugā).

Reference Translation:

* ""The clothes are like Brahmins"" - This translation is correct. In Nepali, ""लुगा"" (lugā) can be used to refer to ""Brahmins"", who are considered to be the highest caste in Hinduism.
* ""The behavior is like evil"" - This translation is also correct. In Nepali, ""व्यवहार"" (vyavahār) can be used to refer to ""evil"" or ""bad"" behavior.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not accurate or reliable. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and reflects the correct meaning of the original Nepali sentence.

Overall, the machine translation seems to have made several errors in both the word choice and the grammar of the sentence. It's important to use high-quality translation tools and resources to ensure that the translation is accurate and faithful to the original meaning.

However, the reference translation uses the name ""Vyas"" to translate the same phrase, which is more accurate as ""Vyas"" is a common name in Nepali.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""It was divided"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""It was divided into four parts by""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""यसलाई द्वापर"" (Yasalai Dwapar), which is commonly used in Nepali to refer to the Dwapar era. The reference translation includes this idiomatic expression, which makes the translation more natural and accurate.
4. Cultural references: The machine translation does not include any cultural references that are specific to Nepal or Hindu mythology, such as the mention of ""sage Vyas"" in the reference translation. This can make the translation sound less authentic and culturally relevant.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and culturally relevant than the machine translation.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""durgas"" instead of ""forts"" in the reference translation. ""Durgas"" is a Nepali word that can refer to a fort or a stronghold, but it may not be the most appropriate choice in this context.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""took"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense verb ""took on."" This may not be a significant difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Names: The machine translation uses the name ""Abaji"" instead of ""Abajil"" in the reference translation. ""Abaji"" is a common spelling variation of the name, but it may not be the most accurate or widely recognized spelling.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation.

Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the reference translation, such as ""सुख्खा"" (sukha), ""खडेरी"" (khaadere), and ""अनिकालको समयमा"" (anikalo samayma). These expressions are important for conveying the cultural and social context of the Newar community's worship practices.
4. Tone: The machine translation sounds more formal and lacks the warmth and reverence that is often used in Nepali language when referring to religious practices. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses more colloquial language and a more respectful tone to convey the significance of the Newar community's worship practices.
5. Cultural context: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the Newar community's worship practices.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""vessels"" to translate ""मानिसहरु"" (mānīsaharu), which means ""people"" in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses the word ""sugarcane"" to translate ""कुमाऊँ"" (kumāun), which means ""India"" in Nepali.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""go"" to translate ""उल्लेखित"" (ullekhit), which means ""went"" in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses the past tense ""went"" to translate ""उल्लेखित"" (ullekhit).
3. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses the word ""vessels"" to translate ""सातवटा"" (sātavatā), which means ""seven"" in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses the word ""seven"" directly to translate ""सातवटा"" (sātavatā).
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""भन्ने ठाउँमा"" (bhannē Ḡāunmā), which means ""and took"" in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses the phrase ""took seven sugarcanes with them"" to convey the same meaning.

Overall, the machine translation does not capture the nuances of the Nepali language as well as the reference translation does. The machine translation uses more formal language and does not take into account the idiomatic expressions and cultural context of Nepali. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation of the given text.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Permission of posts in the banned area must be taken""
	* Reference translation: ""Permission to walk in restricted areas should be obtained""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""posts in the banned area"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. In Nepali, the phrase used is ""प्रतिबन्धित क्षेत्रमा"" which means ""restricted areas"". Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate in this regard.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""must be taken from the home secretary""
	* Reference translation: ""should be obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs""

The machine translation uses the verb tense ""must"" which is not necessary in this sentence. The reference translation uses the verb tense ""should"" which is more appropriate in this context.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""home secretary""
	* Reference translation: ""Ministry of Home Affairs""

The machine translation uses the literal translation of ""home secretary"" which is not an idiomatic expression in Nepali. In Nepali, the term used is ""गृह मन्त्रालय"" which means ""Ministry of Home Affairs"". Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate in this regard.

4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Permission of posts in the banned area must be taken from the home secretary.""
	* Reference translation: ""Permission to walk in restricted areas should be obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs.""

The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, which can make it less clear and less idiomatic. The reference translation maintains the original word order of the sentence, which is more natural and idiomatic in Nepali.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation in this case. The reference translation uses more appropriate language and grammar, and maintains the original word order of the sentence.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""they play"" are placed at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, they are placed at the beginning.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense. This is a significant difference, as it affects the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Verbs: The machine translation uses the verb ""play"" twice in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the verb ""play"" only once. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the clarity of the sentence.
4. Prepositions: The machine translation uses the preposition ""in"" twice in the sentence, while the reference translation uses it only once. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the meaning of the sentence slightly.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""bonpoles"" instead of ""Bonpos"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""bonpoles"" is not a commonly used term in Nepali, while ""Bonpos"" is the correct term for the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.
6. Grammar: The machine translation has a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a subject-verb-object structure, while the reference translation uses a subject-object-verb structure.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, tense, and grammatical structure. The reference translation provides a more accurate and nuanced translation of the original Nepali sentence.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""battle"" instead of ""war"" in the reference translation.
2. Meaning: The machine translation suggests that the battle took place at the base of a course, while the reference translation implies that the Maoists fought the war on the basis of a shared curriculum.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is fought"" in the source sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""had fought.""
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""आधारमा"" (on the basis of) in the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence, and the reference translation provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not accurate or reliable. The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation of the original Nepali text.

Here are some reasons why the machine translation is not accurate:

1. Lack of contextual understanding: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural and historical context of the original text, which can lead to inaccurate translations.
2. Limited vocabulary: The machine translation may not have access to a large enough vocabulary to accurately translate certain words or phrases.
3. Incorrect grammar: The machine translation may not be able to accurately translate grammatical structures or idiomatic expressions.
4. Lack of human oversight: Machine translations are often generated without human oversight or review, which can lead to errors and inaccuracies.

In contrast, the reference translation is more accurate and culturally appropriate because it has been reviewed and edited by a human translator who is familiar with the language and cultural context of the original text.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""synonymous physician""
	* Reference translation: ""divine thoughts""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the term ""synonymous"" which means ""having the same meaning or value"" instead of ""divine thoughts"" which refers to thoughts or ideas that are considered to be inspired by a divine source.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""features elaborate mental psychology""
	* Reference translation: ""add to the mental sufferings""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb tense ""features"" which is in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""add"" which is in the present participle tense.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: "" elaborate mental psychology""
	* Reference translation: ""mental sufferings""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""elaborate mental psychology"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali, while the reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic expression ""mental sufferings"".
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""in man""
	* Reference translation: ""in humans""
	* Difference: The machine translation places the word ""in"" before ""man"" while the reference translation places it before ""humans"".
5. Tone:
	* Machine translation: "" elaborate mental psychology in man""
	* Reference translation: ""mental sufferings in humans""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a more formal and academic tone, while the reference translation uses a more conversational and informal tone.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, word order, and tone. While the machine translation is accurate in terms of grammar and vocabulary, it lacks the nuance and idiomatic expressions of the reference translation, which makes it sound more natural and conversational.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""came to pass"" instead of ""it came to pass"" in the reference translation. ""Came to pass"" is a more formal and old-fashioned phrase, while ""it came to pass"" is more common and natural in modern English.
2. Tense consistency: The machine translation switches between past and present tense in the sentence, while the reference translation maintains a consistent past tense throughout. For example, in the machine translation, ""had drawn up"" is in the past tense, but ""there was no change in it"" is in the present tense.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""when"" at the beginning of the sentence instead of after ""the people"". This can make the sentence sound less natural and more awkward.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""looked forward"" to convey the idea of waiting for something, while the machine translation uses the more literal ""awaited"".
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""had drawn up"" in the past perfect tense, which is not necessary in this context. The reference translation uses the simple past tense ""endured"" to convey the idea of suffering or hardship.

Overall, the reference translation is more natural and idiomatic in English, while the machine translation has some errors in word choice, tense consistency, and word order.

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation uses the word ""appropriately"" to translate the Nepali word ""यो"" (yo), which is not entirely accurate. In this context, ""suitable"" would be a better choice.
* The machine translation also uses the word ""pierced"" to translate the Nepali word ""उपयुक्त"" (upayukta), which is not a correct translation. In this context, ""agreed"" would be a better choice.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""society"" to translate ""समाज"" (samaj), which is a more general term that can refer to any group of people with shared cultural or social ties. In contrast, the reference translation uses the word ""Tamang society"" to specifically refer to the Tamang ethnic group.
2. Isolation: The machine translation uses the word ""separate"" to translate ""अलग्ग"" (alag), which means ""isolated"" or ""distinct"". However, the reference translation uses the word ""isolated"" to convey the same meaning.
3. Context: The machine translation does not provide any context for the word ""tamang"", which is a term used to refer to the Tamang ethnic group in Nepal. In contrast, the reference translation provides context by mentioning the Tamang society, which suggests that the speaker is referring to a specific social or cultural group.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense to translate the Nepali sentence, which is grammatically correct but may not convey the intended meaning. In contrast, the reference translation uses the past tense to convey a sense of historical or cultural context.

Based on these differences, it seems that the reference translation is more accurate and contextually appropriate than the machine translation. The reference translation provides more specific and relevant information about the Tamang society, while the machine translation uses more general terms that may not be as meaningful in this context.

Overall, the reference translation is a more reliable and accurate translation of the Nepali sentence, and it provides a better understanding of the cultural and social context in which the sentence is used.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""Earl"" to refer to the king, which is not a common term in Nepali. In the reference translation, the king is referred to as ""Prithvipati Shah,"" which is a more accurate and common term in Nepali.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense for the verb ""set up,"" which is not necessary in Nepali. In the reference translation, the verb is in the past tense, which is more appropriate for a historical event.
3. Word order: In the machine translation, the words ""of Hanuman"" are placed after the noun ""image,"" which is not the correct word order in Nepali. In the reference translation, the words ""of Hanuman"" are placed before the noun ""image.""
4. Accuracy: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""गोरखाका"" (Gorkha) as ""Earl,"" which is not a correct translation. In Nepali, ""Gorkha"" refers to a specific region in Nepal, not a title of nobility.
5. Cultural context: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the sentence. In Nepali culture, Hanuman is a revered deity, and it is common to set up statues of him in front of palaces or other important buildings. The reference translation captures this cultural context more accurately.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and culturally appropriate than the machine translation. The machine translation makes several errors in word choice, grammar, word order, and cultural context, which can affect the overall quality of the translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""hyskool"" instead of ""high school"" in the reference translation. This is a common error in machine translations, as they often struggle to recognize proper nouns and proper terminology.
2. Tense consistency: The machine translation switches between past and present tenses in the sentence. For example, ""started to open"" in the first part of the sentence is in the past tense, but ""started opening"" in the second part is in the present tense. The reference translation maintains a consistent tense throughout the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""some schools in different parts of the country"" comes after ""But,"" while in the reference translation, it comes before. This can make the sentence sound less coherent and clear.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""open at the same time"" used in the reference translation. This is a common issue in machine translations, as they may not be able to recognize and translate idiomatic expressions accurately.
5. Grammar: The machine translation has a grammatical error in the second part of the sentence, where it uses the verb ""started"" in the plural form instead of the singular form. The reference translation correctly uses the singular form of the verb.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation in this case. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence more effectively, with better word choice, tense consistency, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""divine relationship"" to translate ""भावनात्मक सम्बन्ध"" (bhāvanātmaka samabhañjana), which is a more formal and literary term. In contrast, the reference translation uses the term ""emotional relation"" to translate the same phrase, which is a more common and conversational term used in everyday language.
2. Tone: The machine translation conveys a more formal and serious tone, while the reference translation has a more conversational and informal tone.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""very meaningful"" to translate ""धेरै मजबुत हुन्छ"" (dherain majboot huncho), which is an idiomatic expression in Nepali. The reference translation does not use an idiomatic expression and instead uses a more literal translation of the phrase.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout the translation, while the reference translation uses the past tense to indicate that the relationship between the mother and her baby is no longer existing.
5. Cultural nuances: The machine translation does not capture the cultural nuances of the Nepali language and the relationship between a mother and her baby. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the term ""breastfeeding mother"" to convey the idea that the baby is still dependent on the mother for nourishment, which is a significant cultural aspect of Nepali society.

Overall, the machine translation falls short in capturing the nuances of the Nepali language and culture, and the reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation of the original text.

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""खेल्लने"" (khelne), which means ""to play"" in Nepali, while the reference translation uses the verb ""खेल्ने"" (khelne), which is the present tense form of the verb.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""खास गरेर"" (khas garer), which means ""especially"" in Nepali, while the reference translation uses the more common idiomatic expression ""धमारी"" (dhamari), which means ""practice"" or ""custom"" in Nepali.
4. Sentence structure: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the reference translation, with more clauses and phrases.

3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""bravery"" instead of ""Brahmins"" in the reference translation. This is a significant error, as ""Brahmins"" are a specific group of people in Nepal who are known for their religious and cultural significance.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses a grammatically incorrect sentence structure in the second half of the sentence. In Nepali, the verb ""worship"" is in the third person singular form, but the machine translation uses the third person plural form ""are"" instead.

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense in the sentence. The sentence should be in the present tense to match the context.
3. Punctuation: The machine translation lacks proper punctuation, which makes the sentence difficult to read and understand.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, which makes it difficult to understand the meaning.

Machine Translation:

* ""During the sum sadhana, he visited various places in India.""

Reference Translation:

* ""During his yoga practice, he visited various places in India.""

The main differences between the two translations are:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""sum sadhana"" instead of ""yoga practice"" in the reference translation. ""Sum sadhana"" is a Nepali word that means ""yoga practice"" or ""meditation,"" while ""yoga practice"" is a more common and widely accepted term in English.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""visited"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""visited"" to indicate that the action of visiting took place in the past.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the prepositional phrase ""in India"" after the verb ""visited,"" while the reference translation places it before the verb. In English, it is more common to place the prepositional phrase before the verb.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""various places"" instead of the more literal ""different places"" used in the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The word choice, grammar, and word order differences suggest that the machine translation may not fully understand the context and nuances of the original Nepali sentence. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more reliable and accurate translation of the sentence.

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""was salvaged"" to translate the Nepali sentence, which is incorrect. The reference translation uses the past tense ""was to get rid of"" to match the verb tense of the Nepali sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression "" king's ghost"" used in the reference translation. This expression is not commonly used in English, and it requires a good understanding of Nepali culture and language to translate it accurately.
4. Context: The machine translation does not provide any context for the sentence, which makes it difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation provides some context by mentioning the king's ghost, which helps to clarify the meaning of the sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""advances"" to refer to the progress or developments made in the field of science, while the reference translation uses the word ""ups and downs."" The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural in this context, as ""ups and downs"" is a common expression used to describe a series of events or experiences that are varied or unpredictable.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense to describe the events that have already occurred. The reference translation is more accurate in this regard, as the journey of scientific research is completed and the results are already known.
3. Clarity: The machine translation is not as clear as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the original sentence. The reference translation provides more context and clarity by using the phrase ""journey of scientific research,"" which helps the reader understand the nature of the travels being referred to.
4. Fluency: The machine translation is less fluent than the reference translation, particularly in the use of the verb tenses. The reference translation flows more smoothly and naturally in English, with a more consistent use of verb tenses and a clearer structure.
5. Cultural appropriateness: The reference translation is more culturally appropriate than the machine translation in several ways. Firstly, the use of the phrase ""journey of scientific research"" is more appropriate than ""his travels"" in this context, as it emphasizes the purpose and nature of the travels rather than just the act of traveling. Secondly, the reference translation uses the word ""controversies"" to refer to the disagreements and debates that may have arisen during the research, which is a more appropriate term than ""disputes"" in this context.

Machine Translation:

* ""Therefore there is no partial truth in the opinion of diggers, neither is there any partial truth in the opinion of perfection.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Therefore, in Khanal's view, even if there is partial truth, there is representation of no absolute truth.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""diggers"" instead of ""Khanal"" in the reference translation.
2. Tense: The machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation is in the past tense.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, placing ""neither"" before ""partial truth"" instead of after it.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""in Khanal's view"" in the reference translation.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence, which is that there is no absolute truth in Khanal's opinion.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence and is more idiomatic in its expression. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""overwhelming"" instead of ""this nervous planet"" in the source text. In the reference translation, ""this nervous planet"" is used to convey the same meaning.
2. Gender agreement: In the machine translation, ""Agnes"" is used as the feminine form of the name ""Agni,"" which is incorrect. In the reference translation, ""Agni"" is used as the masculine form of the name.
3. Number agreement: In the machine translation, ""Jupiter"" is used as the singular form of the name, while in the reference translation, ""deities"" is used as the plural form to refer to multiple gods.
4. Word order: In the machine translation, the words ""of this"" are added to the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, the word order is different.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""this nervous planet"" used in the source text, which is a common expression in Nepali.
6. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense for ""Jupiter"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses the genitive case for ""Guru Brihaspati"" to indicate possession.
7. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses ""lord"" instead of ""lord of this constellation"" in the reference translation.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the original Nepali text.

1. Word choice: In the machine translation, the word ""backlash"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""Backlash event"" is used. This is a minor difference, but it does affect the clarity of the sentence. The reference translation provides more context and makes it clear that the event is called ""Backlash.""
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense (""lost with"") while the reference translation uses the past perfect tense (""lost the title a month later""). This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame of the event. The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as it indicates that the event occurred a month after the initial event.
3. Word order: In the machine translation, the words ""a month later"" are placed after the verb ""lost,"" while in the reference translation, they are placed before the verb. This is a minor difference in word order, but it can affect the overall clarity of the sentence. The reference translation is more consistent in its word order, which makes it easier to read and understand.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""a backlash program,"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in English. In contrast, the reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic phrase ""Backlash event."" This is a more significant difference, as it affects the naturalness and fluency of the translation.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation provides more context, uses more common and idiomatic expressions, and is more consistent in its word order. Based on these differences, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

1. Machine translation: ""In this dimension of the book, life is combined with technical things such as horn presentation, segmentation, aggregation, meaning nature and office.""

The machine translation seems to have struggled with the nuances of the original Nepali sentence. Here are some of the differences I noticed:

* ""life"" is translated as ""life"" instead of ""poetry"" which is the correct translation of the original Nepali word ""कविता"" (kavitā).
* ""technical things"" is a poor translation of the original Nepali word ""सिङ्गो"" (sīngo), which refers to the technical aspects of poetry, such as metaphor, imagery, and symbolism.
* ""horn presentation"" is a completely incorrect translation of the original Nepali word ""खण्डयोजना"" (khaṇḍyojanā), which means ""segmentation"" or ""division"".
* ""aggregation"" is a poor translation of the original Nepali word ""सन्धि"" (sandhi), which means ""treaty"" or ""agreement"".
* ""meaning nature"" is a poor translation of the original Nepali word ""अर्थ प्रकृति"" (artha prakriti), which means ""meaning essence"" or ""essence of meaning"".
* ""office"" is a completely incorrect translation of the original Nepali word ""कार्यावस्था"" (kāryāvasthā), which means ""working condition"" or ""state of work"".
2. Reference translation: ""In such a dimension of poetry, the whole presentation of the world of life, segmentation, treaty, nature and working condition are combined.""

The reference translation is a much better representation of the original Nepali sentence. Here are some of the improvements I noticed:

* ""poetry"" is correctly translated as ""poetry"" instead of ""life"".
* ""world of life"" is a better translation of the original Nepali phrase ""जीवन जगत"" (jīvan jagat), which refers to the totality of life and its experiences.
* ""segmentation"" is correctly translated as ""segmentation"" instead of ""horn presentation"".
* ""treaty"" is correctly translated as ""treaty"" instead of ""aggregation"".
* ""nature"" is correctly translated as ""nature"" instead of ""meaning nature"".
* ""working condition"" is correctly translated as ""working condition"" instead of ""office"".

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali sentence, while the machine translation contains several errors and inaccuracies.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""paking"" (contraction of ""packing"")
	* Reference translation: ""elongation of upper interbranch tract""
	
The machine translation uses the word ""paking"" which is not a common term in English. The reference translation uses the more standard term ""elongation of upper interbranch tract"".

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""may be much earlier"" (passive voice)
	* Reference translation: ""may occur much earlier"" (active voice)
	
The machine translation uses the passive voice construction ""may be much earlier"", which is less common in English. The reference translation uses the active voice construction ""may occur much earlier"", which is more standard.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""the ground beginning condition""
	* Reference translation: ""the ground one""
	
The machine translation reverses the word order in the phrase ""ground beginning condition"", which is not typical in English. The reference translation keeps the original word order.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""quickly paking""
	* Reference translation: ""early maturing species""
	
The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""quickly paking"", which is not a common or standard way to express the idea of early maturity in English. The reference translation uses the more standard idiomatic expression ""early maturing species"".

Overall, the machine translation has several errors and inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and grammatically correct, and better conveys the intended meaning of the original Nepali sentence.

Machine Translation:

* ""Equivalent to the early days of life and the last days of life events are also found.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Similarity in early days of life and the last days of life events are also found.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""equivalent"" instead of ""similarity"". While ""equivalent"" can convey a sense of similarity, it also implies a more direct comparison between the two things, which may not be the intended meaning in this context. In contrast, the reference translation uses the more straightforward word ""similarity"".
2. Tense consistency: The machine translation switches between two tenses in the same sentence, which can make it sound awkward. The first part of the sentence is in the past tense (""early days of life""), while the second part is in the present tense (""last days of life events""). The reference translation maintains consistency in the past tense throughout the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation rearranges the words in the sentence, placing ""equivalent"" before ""to the early days of life"". In the reference translation, the words are in a more traditional order, with ""similarity"" coming before the noun it modifies.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""last days of life events"", which may not be a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. The reference translation uses the more common phrase ""last days of life"".

Overall, the machine translation has some errors in word choice, tense consistency, word order, and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding in Nepali.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""governor"" to translate ""सूरत"" (Surat), while the reference translation uses ""fort"" to translate the same word. This difference in word choice may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""governor"" typically refers to a high-ranking official in charge of a government or territory, while ""fort"" refers to a stronghold or a fortified structure.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""was"") to translate the verb ""थियो"" (thyo), while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was"") to translate the same verb. This difference in verb tense may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the past tense typically indicates that an action has already occurred, while the present tense indicates that an action is ongoing or continuous.
3. Word order: The machine translation places the prepositional phrase ""of Western merchants"" after the noun ""governor,"" while the reference translation places it before the noun. This difference in word order may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the prepositional phrase provides additional information about the governor's identity and role.
4. Translation of ""हजमा"" (Hajj): The machine translation translates ""हजमा"" as ""gateway,"" while the reference translation translates it as ""Hajj."" This difference in translation may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""Hajj"" typically refers to the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, while ""gateway"" is a more general term that could refer to any entrance or passage.
5. Translation of ""हिन्दुस्तानी"" (Hindustani): The machine translation does not provide a direct translation for ""हिन्दुस्तानी,"" while the reference translation translates it as ""Indian Muslims."" This difference in translation may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""Hindustani"" typically refers to a cultural or linguistic identity that is specific to the Indian subcontinent, while ""Indian Muslims"" is a more general term that refers to Muslims who are citizens or residents of India.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word choice, grammar, word order, and translation of specific terms. These differences may affect the overall meaning and accuracy of the translation, and may indicate that the machine translation is not as accurate or reliable as the reference translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""gods"" (devatas) throughout, while the reference translation uses ""gods like Dhamari, Jhoda, Chutkila, etc."" This suggests that the reference translation is more specific and accurate in its word choice, as it acknowledges that there are multiple gods being referred to, rather than simply using a generic term.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout, while the reference translation uses the present and past tenses. For example, in the machine translation, ""In the temples of the gods in west Nepal"" is in the present tense, while in the reference translation, ""In western Nepal, it is customary to sing the songs of gods like Dhamari, Jhoda, Chutkila etc."" is in both the present and past tenses. This suggests that the reference translation is more accurate in its use of grammar.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the source text. For example, the reference translation uses the phrase ""in religious festivals"" to convey the idea of festivals related to the gods, while the machine translation simply translates it as ""धार्मिक उत्सवहरूमा.""
4. Cultural nuances: The reference translation captures the cultural nuances of the source text better than the machine translation. For example, the reference translation uses the term ""Dharma"" to refer to religious festivals, which is a common term in Nepali culture. The machine translation does not capture this cultural context.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and nuanced than the machine translation in capturing the meaning and cultural context of the source text. While the machine translation is a good starting point, it is clear that more work is needed to produce a high-quality translation that accurately conveys the meaning and cultural context of the original text.

3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""After a few weeks of that event"" is separated into two clauses, while in the reference translation, it is combined into one sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""सन माइकल्स पनि डब्ल्यूडब्ल्यूईमा"" (Sun Micross also returned to WWE and he joined the ufu on the nu wild odor team) which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali.

While both phrases convey the same meaning, ""prominent in"" is a more idiomatic and natural-sounding phrase in English, especially when translating from Nepali to English.
3. The machine translation uses the word ""here"" at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation does not. In general, it's best to avoid using articles (such as ""the"" or ""a"") in translation, especially when the context makes their meaning clear from the context.

Overall, the machine translation is a decent effort, but there are some minor errors and inefficiencies that could be improved upon. The reference translation is a more accurate and natural-sounding translation of the original Nepali sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""hope"" in the singular form, while the reference translation uses the word ""hopes"" in the plural form. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tense: The machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation is in the past tense. This is a significant difference, as it changes the time frame in which the statement is made.
3. Name correction: The machine translation incorrectly translates the name ""Ronaldo"" to ""Ronaldoom"". This is a significant error, as it changes the identity of the person being referred to.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""in 2014"" after ""World Cup"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the clarity of the sentence.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""had all its hopes on"", which is more natural and idiomatic than the machine translation's ""was centered on"".

Based on these differences, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as low, and the reference translation as high. The machine translation makes several significant errors, including incorrect word choice, tense, and name correction, which can affect the overall meaning and clarity of the sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and idiomatic, making it a better translation overall.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""Nepali culture"" instead of ""Nepali culture and tradition"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""Nepal was not..."") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""Nepali culture, entry of one caste did not lead to the struggle of another caste in Nepal""). This difference in tense can affect the sentence's meaning and context.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""Nepal was not"" comes before ""a nation's entry into Nepal,"" while in the reference translation, ""Nepali culture"" comes before ""entry of one caste."" This difference in word order can affect the emphasis and structure of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""one caste"" in the reference translation. Instead, it uses the phrase ""another nation's struggle."" This difference in idiomatic expressions can affect the naturalness and fluency of the translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""lead"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""led"" in the past tense. This difference in verb tense can affect the sentence's meaning and context.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural as the reference translation. The reference translation uses more formal and idiomatic language, which is more appropriate for a formal translation. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses more informal language and makes some grammatical errors.

Overall, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, natural, and idiomatic, which makes it a better representation of the original Nepali text.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation uses the term ""Deva"" to refer to Hanuman, which is not accurate. In Nepali, ""Deva"" is a term used to refer to a god or a deity, and it is not a suitable term to use when translating Hanuman's identity.
* The translation also uses the word ""events"" instead of ""life"" to refer to the experiences of God Ram. In Nepali, ""life"" is a more common term used to refer to a person's experiences and actions.
* The translation also uses the word ""attributes"" instead of ""traits"" to refer to Hanuman's personality. While ""attributes"" can refer to any characteristic or quality, ""traits"" is a more common term used to refer to personality characteristics.

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation uses the term ""God"" instead of ""Deva"" to refer to Hanuman, which is more accurate.
* The translation uses the word ""life"" instead of ""events"" to refer to the experiences of God Ram.
* The translation uses the term ""personality traits"" instead of ""attributes"" to refer to Hanuman's personality. This term is more accurate and common in Nepali.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic in Nepali than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more common and appropriate terms to refer to the concepts being discussed, and it is more faithful to the original Nepali text.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""One of them was successful in escaping the administrative bloc of the remaining 6 if the security guard killed one of the schools in the construction.""
	* Reference translation: ""One of them was killed by the security personnel in the reading room while the other six managed to escape to the administrative block of the school.""

The machine translation has a grammatical error in the sentence ""killed one of the schools"" which should be ""killed one of the students"" or ""killed one of the teachers"" depending on the context. The reference translation corrected this error by using the correct phrase ""administrative block of the school"".

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""एकलाई सुरक्षाकर्मीले"" (ekali surakshakarmaile)
	* Reference translation: ""security personnel""

The machine translation uses the Nepali word ""एकलाई"" (ekali) which means ""one"" in English, but it is not a common term used in English to refer to security personnel. The reference translation uses the more common term ""security personnel"" which is a more accurate and natural way to translate the Nepali phrase.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""वाचनालयमा"" (vaachanalayma)
	* Reference translation: ""reading room""

The machine translation uses the Nepali phrase ""वाचनालयमा"" (vaachanalayma) which is not a common idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more common term ""reading room"" which is a more natural and idiomatic way to translate the Nepali phrase.

4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""One of them was successful in escaping the administrative bloc of the remaining 6 if the security guard killed one of the schools in the construction.""
	* Reference translation: ""One of them was killed by the security personnel in the reading room while the other six managed to escape to the administrative block of the school.""

The machine translation has a more complex sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation breaks the sentence into simpler phrases for easier comprehension, while the machine translation keeps the sentence as a single, longer sentence.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The machine translation has some grammatical errors, uses uncommon vocabulary, and has a more complex sentence structure than the reference translation.

2. Tone: The machine translation has a more casual tone than the reference translation. The reference translation uses more formal language, which is more appropriate for a formal translation.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense for both ""Shami"" and ""Rudraksha,"" while the reference translation uses the possessive form ""of the world"" in the second sentence, which is not present in the machine translation.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""considered rare in the world"" to convey the idea that these trees are rare globally.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation does not include any cultural references, while the reference translation includes a cultural reference to ""Shami"" and ""Rudraksha"" trees, which are significant in Nepali culture.
6. Accuracy: The machine translation makes a minor error in the spelling of ""Rudraksha"" (it should be ""Rudraksh"" in Nepali).

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and precise than the machine translation in terms of word choice, tone, grammar, idiomatic expressions, cultural references, and accuracy. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for any official or formal translation needs.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""illustrations"" instead of ""dresses"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""yesterday"" while the reference translation uses the present tense ""such dresses"". This difference in tense can change the meaning of the sentence, as ""yesterday"" implies that the influence of modern styles and designs is no longer present, while ""such dresses"" implies that they are still rare.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""of modern styles and designs"" after ""clothing"" instead of before it. This can make the sentence harder to read and understand.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""rare these days"" to convey the idea that modern styles and designs are not commonly seen. The machine translation does not use this expression, instead using the literal translation of ""influence of clothing"".
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""found"" instead of ""is found"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall grammar of the sentence.

	* Reference translation: ""Tamangs build chaityas in the name of the deceased"" - This sentence is more culturally appropriate as it reflects the common practice of building chaityas in Nepal to honor the deceased.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural in Nepali compared to the machine translation. The reference translation captures the cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions of Nepali better, making it a more reliable translation.

	* Machine translation: ""smoke absorption"" (machine translation) vs. ""smoking cessation"" (reference translation)
	* Machine translation: ""supplemental oxygen"" (machine translation) vs. ""oxygen"" (reference translation)
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""धुम्रपान"" (machine translation) vs. ""smoke absorption"" (reference translation)
	* Machine translation: ""त्याग"" (machine translation) vs. ""cessation"" (reference translation)
	* Machine translation: ""पूरक अक्सिजन"" (machine translation) vs. ""supplemental oxygen"" (reference translation)
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""lowers"" (machine translation) vs. ""reduces"" (reference translation)

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation uses simpler language and word choices that are not as precise as the reference translation. Additionally, the machine translation introduces some errors in grammar and idiomatic expressions, which further reduce its accuracy.

Overall, while the machine translation may be able to convey the general meaning of the original text, it is not as reliable or accurate as a professional human translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the words ""For him"" are placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, they are placed at the end of the sentence. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machines often struggle to preserve the word order of the source language in the target language.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""was ranked"") for both Edison Cavani and Forlan, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""scored"") for both. This is because the reference translation is based on a specific event that occurred in the past, while the machine translation is simply translating the sentence as a whole without considering the tense of the individual words.
3. Names: The machine translation uses the name ""Edison Cavani"" instead of ""Edison Cavani"" in the reference translation. This is a common error in machine translations, as machines may not be able to recognize proper nouns or names in the source language.
4. Numbers: The machine translation uses the number ""28"" and ""51"" in the wrong order in the sentence. In the reference translation, the numbers are in the correct order. This is another common error in machine translations, as machines may not be able to recognize the correct order of numbers in the source language.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""was ranked"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""scored"" in the past tense. This is a difference in grammar between the two translations, as the reference translation is based on a specific event that occurred in the past, while the machine translation is simply translating the sentence as a whole without considering the tense of the individual words.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have significant differences in terms of word order, tense, names, numbers, and grammar. These differences suggest that the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation, and may not be suitable for formal or professional use.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""joggers"" instead of ""jogis"" in the reference translation. ""Joggers"" is a more general term that refers to people who engage in jogging or running as a form of exercise, while ""jogis"" is a term specific to Nepali culture that refers to traditional Nepali dancers.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""gather together"") in the first sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""gathered their relatives"") to describe the action of the jogis gathering their relatives.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""swap and smile"" to describe the action of the jogis sharing joys and sorrows, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""share joys and sorrows"" to convey the same meaning.
4. Cultural context: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the Nepali language and the reference translation does. For example, the term ""jogis"" is a term specific to Nepali culture and is used to refer to traditional Nepali dancers, while the term ""sweethearts"" is a more general term that could refer to any romantic partner.
5. Fluency: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The sentence structure and word choice in the machine translation are less natural and may sound awkward or unnatural to a native English speaker.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation takes into account the cultural context of the Nepali language and uses more appropriate word choice and grammar to convey the intended meaning. The machine translation, on the other hand, relies on more general language rules and may not capture the nuances of the Nepali language and culture.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""guests"" to translate ""मुलद्धारको"" (mull-dharako), which is not the most accurate choice. A more appropriate translation would be ""visitors"" or ""clients"".
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is worn"" to translate ""पित्तलको"" (pittalko), which should be in the past tense to match the original Nepali sentence.
3. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses the word ""artistic"" to translate ""कलात्मक"" (kala-tmk), which is a bit too general. A more accurate translation would be ""ornate"" or ""decorative"".
4. Idioms: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""गजुर"" (gajur) in the original Nepali sentence. ""Gajur"" is a Nepali word that refers to a decorative element made of brass or other metals, and it's not a direct translation of any English word.
5. Fluency: The machine translation doesn't flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The sentence structure and word choice in the machine translation are not as natural-sounding as in the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation falls short in terms of accuracy, vocabulary, and fluency compared to the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more natural and accurate rendering of the original Nepali sentence.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""So soon after the completion of the ranch and the completion of the Indian reservation""
	* Reference translation: ""After this referendum""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the present perfect tense ""So soon after"" which is not necessary in this context. The reference translation uses the simple past tense ""After this referendum"" which is more appropriate.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Lord of sikkim""
	* Reference translation: ""Sikkim's sovereignty""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the term ""Lord of sikkim"" which is not a common term in Nepali language. The reference translation uses the term ""Sikkim's sovereignty"" which is more accurate and appropriate.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""the Lord of sikkim was endowed under the law""
	* Reference translation: ""Sikkim's sovereignty ended under the Indian constitutional system""
	* Difference: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""endowed under the law"" which is commonly used in Nepali language. The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""ended under the Indian constitutional system"" which is more accurate and natural in this context.
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""After the completion of the ranch and the completion of the Indian reservation, the Lord of sikkim was endowed under the law.""
	* Reference translation: ""After this referendum, monarchy ended and Sikkim's sovereignty ended under the Indian constitutional system.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure with multiple clauses, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a clearer flow.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural in Nepali language compared to the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Nepali language better, including the idiomatic expressions and sentence structure. Therefore, I would give a higher quality score to the reference translation.

Reference Translation:

* ""Mahendra overthrew the people-elected government in 2017 BS"" (grammar and vocabulary)
* ""imposed a ban on political parties"" should be ""imposed an autocratic rule"" (vocabulary)

Comparison:

* The machine translation uses more formal language and vocabulary than the reference translation.
* The machine translation uses ""anti-democratic rule"" instead of ""anti-democratic"" in the reference translation.
* The machine translation uses ""perpetrating"" instead of ""staging"" in the reference translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""conveniences"" to translate ""विशेष सुबिधा"" (special facilities), which is not a very common or natural way to express this concept in English. In contrast, the reference translation uses the more common and natural phrase ""special facilities"".
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are utilizing"") to translate ""उपयोग गर्दथे"" (they were using), which is not grammatically correct in English. The reference translation uses the past tense (""were"") to translate this phrase correctly.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""किसान तथा मजदूरको अवस्था"" (the condition of farmers and laborers) correctly. In English, this would be more naturally expressed as ""the state of farmers and workers"".
4. Tone: The machine translation has a more formal and distant tone, while the reference translation has a more conversational and empathetic tone.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence better, including the idiomatic expressions and the tone.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""In this game, durica to go to Slovakia"" - Incorrect use of preposition ""to"" instead of ""in this game"".
	* Reference translation: ""Slovakia 's Jan Durica"" - Correct use of possessive pronoun ""Slovakia's"".
2. Word choice:

Machine Translation:

* ""Rainadevi's robot is also a magistrate who is in front of the magistrates in justice.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Magar being Rainadevi 's chief priest also proves that the Magars are ahead in religious activities as well.""

Differences:

1. Use of ""robot"" vs. ""chief priest"": The machine translation uses the term ""robot"" to translate ""मूलपुजारी"" (mūlapujarī), which is not a common term in Nepali. In this context, a more accurate translation would be ""chief priest"" or ""high priestess"".
2. Use of ""in front of"" vs. ""proves"": The machine translation uses the phrase ""in front of the magistrates in justice"" to translate ""मगर रहनुले धार्मिक कार्यमा पनि मगरहरू"" (magar rahneule dhārmik kāryamā pani magarharū). This phrase is not a direct translation of the original Nepali sentence, and it doesn't convey the same meaning. A more accurate translation would be ""proves"" or ""shows"".
3. Tense inconsistency: The machine translation is in the present tense throughout, while the reference translation is in the past tense. This inconsistency can make the translation sound less natural and less accurate.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The use of ""robot"" instead of ""chief priest"", the awkward phrase ""in front of"" vs. ""proves"", and the inconsistent tense all contribute to a lower quality translation.

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""was going"" instead of ""were on their way"" in the reference translation. This is a common mistake in machine translations, as they often struggle to recognize the correct verb conjugation in Nepali.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the preposition ""to"" before ""mendicant ghats"" instead of after it in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity of the sentence.
4. Names: The machine translation uses ""Manikarnika Ghat"" instead of ""Manikarnik Ghat"" in the reference translation. ""Manikarnik"" is the correct spelling of the name of the ghat in Nepali.
5. Place names: The machine translation uses ""warangasnan"" instead of ""Varanasi"" in the reference translation. ""Varanasi"" is the correct spelling of the city in Nepali.

* The translation of ""भनेको"" (bhaneko) is also incorrect. In Nepali, ""भनेको"" means ""of birth,"" not ""of hair.""
* The translation of ""केश"" (khes) is correct. In Nepali, ""केश"" means ""ritual.""

Reference Translation:

* The sentence is grammatically correct and accurate in terms of word choice and phrasing.
* The translation of ""यसर्थ"" (yasth) is correct. In Nepali, ""यसर्थ"" means ""birth.""
* The translation of ""भनेको"" (bhaneko) is correct. In Nepali, ""भनेको"" means ""of birth.""
* The translation of ""केश"" (khes) is correct. In Nepali, ""केश"" means ""ritual.""

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The machine translation makes several errors in word choice and phrasing, which can make the sentence difficult to understand. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable translation of the given sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""assumed king"" (निर्माता राजा) is translated as ""based on the altar"" (ढाँचा र सम्मेला) in the machine translation.
	* Machine translation: ""snakes"" (नाग) is translated as ""led"" (लगन) in the machine translation.
	* Machine translation: ""tapus"" (तपस्याद्वारा) is translated as ""tapus"" (तपस्याद्वारा) in the machine translation.
	* Reference translation: Uses more formal and traditional vocabulary, such as ""Sanatan Dharma"" (सनातन धर्म) and ""Veda"" (वेद).
2. Grammar and sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is simpler and more direct in the machine translation, with a subject-verb-object word order.
	* Reference translation: The sentence structure is more complex and uses more subordinate clauses, which is more typical of Nepali language.
	* Machine translation: The verb tenses are not always consistent, with some verbs in the past tense and others in the present tense.
	* Reference translation: The verb tenses are consistent throughout the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions and cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture some of the idiomatic expressions and cultural references in the original text, such as ""based on the altar"" (ढाँचा र सम्मेला).
	* Reference translation: The reference translation includes more cultural references and idiomatic expressions that are specific to Nepali language and culture.
4. Fluency and naturalness:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not always produce fluent and natural-sounding sentences, with some phrases sounding awkward or unnatural.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation sounds more fluent and natural, with a better flow of words and phrases.

Overall, the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and fluency. The reference translation captures more of the cultural and linguistic nuances of Nepali language and produces more natural-sounding sentences.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""worked"" in the past tense, while the reference translation uses ""worked far away from home."" This difference in word choice may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does show that the machine translation is not able to accurately capture the nuances of the original Nepali sentence.
2. Tense agreement: The machine translation uses the past tense consistently throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense for ""worked"" and the present tense for ""was very hard to find."" This difference in tense agreement may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as it implies that Ambrose's father's absence was a recurring problem rather than a one-time event.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the verb ""was"" before the subject ""Ambrose,"" while the reference translation puts it after the subject. This difference in word order may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does show that the machine translation is not able to accurately capture the word order of the original Nepali sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""far away from home"" to convey the idea that Ambrose's father was living in a distant location. The machine translation does not use this idiomatic expression, instead using the more literal translation of ""worked."" This difference in idiomatic expressions may affect the overall meaning and fluency of the translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""was"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""was"" in the past tense. This difference in verb tense may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as it implies that Ambrose's father's absence is no longer a problem.

Overall, the machine translation is not able to accurately capture the nuances of the original Nepali sentence, and it makes several errors in word choice, tense agreement, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. The reference translation, on the other hand, is able to accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence and uses more idiomatic expressions to make the translation sound more natural and fluent.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""burial grounds"" instead of ""temple premises"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference as ""burial grounds"" implies a place for burying the dead, whereas ""temple premises"" refers to the area around a temple.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is featured"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""has food and accommodation facilities""). This difference in tense may not be significant in this context, but it could affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""The Temple is featured in the burial grounds of the tirthankaras"" is the sentence structure, while in the reference translation, it is ""The Gaadhi house in the temple premises has food and accommodation facilities for the pilgrims."" This difference in word order may affect the clarity and readability of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""tirthankaras"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference as ""tirthankaras"" is a common idiomatic expression used in Nepali to refer to the sacred sites of Hinduism.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""is"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""has"" in the present tense. This difference in verb choice may not be significant in this context, but it could affect the overall grammar of the sentence.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the sentence. The reference translation provides more context and uses more appropriate language to convey the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable translation of the Nepali sentence.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the machine translation for the given sentence. Here's my analysis step by step:

1. Grammar:
The machine translation has correctly used the present perfect tense (""has been found"") to indicate that the action of finding a significant number of Newars in other countries started in the past and continues to the present. However, the reference translation has used the present simple tense (""are living"") instead of the present perfect tense, which is incorrect.
2. Vocabulary:
The machine translation has used the word ""neighboring"" to indicate the countries where the Newars are living, which is a more formal and technical term. The reference translation has used the word ""other countries"" instead, which is more informal and doesn't convey the same level of specificity.
3. Fluency:
The machine translation has a smoother and more natural flow than the reference translation. The sentence structure is more complex in the reference translation, with multiple clauses and phrases that don't flow as well as they could.
4. Cultural accuracy:
The machine translation has accurately reflected the cultural context of the sentence by using the term ""Newars,"" which is a term specific to the Nepali language and culture. The reference translation has used the more general term ""people"" instead, which lacks specificity and cultural context.
5. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation has accurately used the idiomatic expression ""a significant number of"" to convey the idea of a large but specific quantity. The reference translation has used the more general expression ""a lot of,"" which doesn't convey the same level of specificity.

Based on these evaluations, I would give the machine translation a score of 7 out of 10 and the reference translation a score of 6 out of 10. While the machine translation has made some errors in grammar and vocabulary, it has generally done a good job of conveying the meaning of the original sentence in a clear and natural-sounding way. The reference translation, on the other hand, has made more significant errors in grammar and vocabulary, and could benefit from more attention to detail and cultural accuracy.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""storytelling"" in the source sentence, while the reference translation uses ""story writing"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Number agreement: In the machine translation, the number ""almost 4 dozen"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""around 4 dozens"". This is a more significant difference, as it affects the accuracy of the number being conveyed. The reference translation is more precise in this case, as it uses a more specific number.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the verb ""wrote"" at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation places it earlier in the sentence. This is a minor difference in word order, but it can affect the overall flow of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""his 33 years long history of story writing"" to convey the idea of the writer's experience and expertise in storytelling. The machine translation does not use this idiomatic expression, instead using a more literal translation of ""his 33 years journal of story writing"".
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present perfect tense (""has written"") in the source sentence, while the reference translation uses the past simple tense (""wrote""). This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame of the action being described. The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as it uses the tense that best fits the context.

Overall, the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are relatively minor, but they can affect the accuracy and clarity of the translation. The reference translation is more precise in some areas, such as the number agreement and idiomatic expressions, while the machine translation is more literal in other areas, such as the word choice and word order.

3. Participation vs. department: The machine translation uses the term ""participation"" instead of ""department"" in the reference translation.
4. Tone: The machine translation seems to have a more formal tone than the reference translation, which is more conversational.

Overall, the machine translation seems to have some errors in word choice, tone, and terminology compared to the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding, and it better conveys the intended meaning of the original Nepali sentence.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""However, Gandhi has said in his obituary that he was never worthy of this honour."" (Incorrect use of ""obituary"" instead of ""autobiography"")
	* Reference translation: ""However, Gandhi said in his autobiography that he never felt that he was worthy of this honor."" (Correct use of ""autobiography"")
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""उनलाई"" (unlai) instead of ""he"" or ""him"" (incorrect use of pronoun)
	* Reference translation: ""Gandhi"" (correct use of name)
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""यस सम्मानको"" (yas sammānko) instead of ""this honor"" (incorrect use of phrase)
	* Reference translation: ""this honor"" (correct use of phrase)
4. Tone:
	* Machine translation: The tone of the machine translation is more formal and distant, while the reference translation is more conversational and personal.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The machine translation uses more formal language and makes a few grammatical errors, while the reference translation is more idiomatic and conveys a more personal tone.

Overall, the reference translation is higher quality than the machine translation, and it's clear that a human translator was involved in the process. The machine translation, on the other hand, may have been generated by a computer program or algorithm, which can sometimes produce inaccurate or unnatural-sounding translations.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""house"" to translate ""घरमा"" (gharma), which is a more general term for a dwelling place. In contrast, the reference translation uses ""house of the king of mathura"" to provide more context and clarify the location.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in ""In that song, the story is described"" to match the tense of the source text. However, the reference translation uses the past tense in ""The song tells the story"" to indicate that the event described in the song has already occurred.
3. Word order: The machine translation rearranges the word order in the sentence to make it more grammatically correct in English. For example, it moves ""Devaki's father"" to the beginning of the sentence to make it clearer who is doing the asking.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""कंशका राजा"" (kansh raja), which is a common way to refer to the king of Mathura in Nepali. The reference translation uses the more formal ""king of mathura"" to convey the same meaning.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation does not include the cultural reference to the king of Mathura, which is an important aspect of the story. The reference translation includes this detail to provide context and make the translation more accurate.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation (MT): Speak by favoring methods and its majority.

Reference Translation (RT): Please explain the method of fasting and its greatness.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The MT uses the word ""favoring"" instead of ""explain"" in the RT. ""Favoring"" implies a more general or generalizing approach, whereas ""explain"" conveys a more specific and detailed meaning.
2. Tense: The MT uses the present tense (""speak"") to translate the Nepali verb ""व्रत गर्ने"" (vrat garne), while the RT uses the past tense (""its greatness""). This difference in tense may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the present tense implies ongoing or repeated action, while the past tense emphasizes a completed action.
3. Word order: The MT changes the word order of the Nepali sentence, placing ""methods"" before ""its majority"". In Nepali, the typical word order is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), so the RT maintains this order.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The MT uses the phrase ""favor by"" instead of the more idiomatic ""explain the method of"" in the RT. This may sound less natural or idiomatic to a native English speaker.
5. Cultural references: The RT includes the phrase ""its greatness"" to emphasize the cultural significance of fasting in Nepali culture. The MT does not include this phrase, which may result in a less nuanced or culturally appropriate translation.

Overall, the MT and RT differ in their word choice, tense, word order, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. While the MT may be adequate for simple, straightforward translations, it may not capture the nuances and cultural context of more complex sentences like this one. Therefore, I would recommend using the RT as a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation.

	* Machine translation: ""Besides the three generations, if the property deliberated from prohibition such as bus mail from others,""
	* Reference translation: ""In the case of property transferred through a process such as a box letter from other than three generations,""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""deliberated from prohibition"" which is not a grammatically correct sentence. The reference translation uses the phrase ""transferred through a process"" which is more accurate and clear.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""such a property is considered a nonprofessional taxable property.""
	* Reference translation: ""such property is considered non-commercial taxable property.""

The machine translation uses the term ""nonprofessional"" which is not a commonly used term in Nepali. The reference translation uses the term ""non-commercial"" which is more accurate and clear.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""such a property is considered a nonprofessional taxable property.""
	* Reference translation: ""such property is considered non-commercial taxable property.""

The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""such a property"" which is used in the reference translation.

4. Cultural nuances:

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""nations"" instead of ""ethnic group"". While both terms can be used to refer to a group of people with a shared identity, ""ethnic group"" is more commonly used in this context to refer to a group of people who share a common cultural and linguistic heritage.
2. Phrasing: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure, with multiple clauses, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in the second clause, while the reference translation uses the past tense. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""Tibet Burmese family"", which is not a commonly used expression in Nepali. In Nepali, the term ""Tibetan-Burmese"" is more commonly used to refer to this group of people.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation gets the meaning of the sentence correct, but the wording is not as natural or idiomatic as the reference translation.

Overall, while the machine translation is mostly accurate, there are some minor differences in word choice, phrasing, and grammar that can affect the overall quality of the translation.

1. Incorrect word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""rajas"" instead of ""Congress"" to translate ""Nepali Congress"". This is a significant error, as ""rajas"" means ""kings"" in Nepali, whereas ""Congress"" is the name of a political party in Nepal.
2. Incorrect grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""received"" instead of the past tense ""received"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Lack of context: The machine translation does not provide any context for the word ""degree"". In the reference translation, the word ""degree"" is used to indicate the pace or progress of the revolution, which is not clear from the machine translation.
4. Inconsistent word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""nepali"" twice in the sentence, which is unnecessary and can make the translation sound awkward. In the reference translation, the word ""Nepali"" is used only once to refer to the Nepali Congress.
5. Lack of nuance: The machine translation does not convey the same level of nuance as the reference translation. For example, the reference translation uses the phrase ""a great pace"" to indicate the significance of the revolution, while the machine translation simply states that the Nepali rajas received a degree.

Overall, the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation due to the errors in word choice, grammar, context, and nuance.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""They tend to be acceptable"" is a grammatically correct sentence, but it could be improved by using ""They tend to be acceptable to them"" or ""They tend to be acceptable for them"" to make it more clear who the ""they"" refers to.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the correct grammar throughout the sentence, with ""They reduce difficulty in breathing"" being a grammatically complete sentence.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the word ""स्वाँस्वाँ"" (swaaanswaa) which means ""acceptable"" in Nepali, but the reference translation uses the word ""सुधार"" (sudhaar) which means ""improved"" or ""better"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the word ""ग्राहो"" (graaho) which means ""breathing"" in Nepali, while the machine translation uses ""respiration"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the word ""व्यायाम"" (vyayam) which means ""exercise"" in Nepali, while the machine translation uses ""limit"".
3. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation seems to struggle with the sentence structure and word choice, resulting in a less fluent and less natural-sounding translation compared to the reference translation.
4. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the cultural nuances of the original sentence, such as the use of the word ""सुधार"" (sudhaar) which carries a connotation of improvement or betterment in Nepali culture.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate, natural-sounding, and culturally appropriate compared to the machine translation. The reference translation captures the meaning of the original sentence more clearly and accurately, and the use of the word ""सुधार"" (sudhaar) adds a cultural nuance that is missing in the machine translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation:

* The establishment and national guard developed into the new cheetah ruins.

Reference Translation:

* The newer realizations of stability and national pride developed in Russia.

Differences:

1. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""developed"") to indicate that the establishment and national guard are still in the process of developing, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""developed"") to indicate that the process of development is complete.
2. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""ruins"" to translate ""नयाँ चेतना"" (new cheetah), which is not a common or idiomatic expression in English. In contrast, the reference translation uses the phrase ""newer realizations"" to convey the same meaning.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""developed"" in the plural form (""developed into""), which is not necessary in this sentence. In the reference translation, the verb ""developed"" is used in the singular form to match the subject of the sentence.
4. Idioms: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""नयाँ चेतना"" (new cheetah), which is a common expression in Nepali to refer to something new and improved.
5. Context: The machine translation does not provide any context for the sentence, while the reference translation provides some context by mentioning the location where the development took place (Russia).

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more idiomatic and contextualized translation of the Nepali sentence, while the machine translation is more literal and lacks context.

Machine Translation:

* ""The principal obligations found in this kind of banishment that are neglected by the investigation or spiritual inquiry are:""

Reference Translation:

* ""This type of essays which are close to autobiography has the following features :""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""obligations"" which is not the most appropriate word to convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The reference translation uses the word ""features"" which is a more accurate and precise term to describe the characteristics of the essays.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are neglected"") while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense (""have the following features""). The present perfect tense is more appropriate to describe a general characteristic of a type of essay, rather than a specific action that is ongoing.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the original sentence, placing ""principal"" before ""obligations"" instead of after it. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less clear.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the original Nepali sentence. For example, the phrase ""नजीक रहने"" is an idiomatic expression that means ""to be close to"" or ""to resemble"", but the machine translation does not convey this meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence better, and is more likely to be understood by a native English speaker.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source Text: गोपालको अर्थ हुन्छ गाईको रेखदेख गर्ने र गोविन्दको अर्थ हुन्छ गाईको खोजी गर्ने (Gopal means to look for cattle, and to look for cattle. Govinda means to look for cattle, and Govinda means to look after cattle.)
2. Machine Translation: The machine translation provides two different translations for the two phrases:
	* Gopal means to look for cattle, and to look for cattle.
	* Govinda means to look for cattle, and Govinda means to look after cattle.
3. Reference Translation: The reference translation provides a single translation for both phrases:
	* Gopal means to look after cattle, and Govinda means to look for cattle.
4. Differences:
	* The machine translation provides two different translations for the two phrases, while the reference translation provides a single translation for both.
	* The machine translation translates गोपाल (Gopal) as ""to look for cattle"" in both instances, while the reference translation translates it as ""to look after cattle"" in the first instance and ""to look for cattle"" in the second instance.
	* Similarly, the machine translation translates गोविन्दको (Govinda) as ""to look for cattle"" in both instances, while the reference translation translates it as ""to look after cattle"" in the first instance and ""to look for cattle"" in the second instance.
5. Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, it can be seen that the machine translation provides two different translations for the two phrases, which are not consistent with the reference translation. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is not satisfactory. It is important to use a reliable and accurate translation source, such as the reference translation, to ensure that the translation is accurate and consistent.

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""requires"") in both the subject and the verb, while the reference translation uses the present participle (""is necessary"") in the subject and the infinitive phrase (""for its proper nutrition"") in the verb.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""sattvic food"" which is a Nepali term that refers to food that is pure, healthy, and nourishing.
4. Cultural references: The machine translation does not take into account any cultural references or nuances, while the reference translation uses the term ""sattvic food"" which is specific to Nepali culture and refers to food that is considered pure and healthy according to Hindu and Buddhist beliefs.
5. Fluency: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The sentence structure and word choice in the machine translation are less natural and may sound awkward or unnatural to a native English speaker.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation takes into account cultural nuances and uses more idiomatic expressions, while the machine translation relies on more basic word choice and grammar.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""queens"" to translate ""पर्ती वनहरू"" (Parti forests), while the reference translation uses ""queen forests"". This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""there are also some queens"") while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense (""there are also some queen forests""). This difference in verb tense may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the present perfect tense implies that the queens have existed or been present for some time, while the present tense implies that they are currently existing or happening.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""पर्ती वनहरू"" (Parti forests). This idiomatic expression is commonly used in Nepali to refer to forests that are owned or managed by the government or other organizations.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation accurately translates the word ""निजीवनका"" (private) as ""private"", but it does not accurately translate ""खरवनी"" (forest) as ""queen forests"". The reference translation accurately translates ""खरवनी"" as ""forest"".

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions.

The machine translation adds the word ""and"" after ""magazine"" in the reference translation, which is not present in the original sentence. This can make the sentence sound less natural and may change its meaning slightly.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""for it""
	* Reference translation: ""through the newspaper and audiovisual""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""for it"" at the end of the sentence, which is not a common idiomatic expression in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses the more common phrase ""through the newspaper and audiovisual.""

4. Sentence structure:

5. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the second sentence. It should have said ""two inch mortar"" instead of ""two inch"".
6. Accuracy: The machine translation gets the accuracy of the weapons wrong. The 81 mm mortar shell is actually larger than the 2 inch mortar.

Overall, the machine translation is of poor quality and contains several errors. It is not a reliable translation and should not be used for official purposes. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and follows proper grammar and vocabulary usage.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""sabai"" (all) instead of ""sab"" (all) in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tense consistency: The machine translation uses the present tense (""he scored"") throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""he scored"") in the second part of the sentence. This inconsistency in tense can make the sentence sound less natural.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the verb ""scored"" after the noun ""goal"" in the second part of the sentence, while the reference translation puts it before the noun. This difference in word order can affect the emphasis and flow of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""in the same season"" to convey the idea of a continuous period of time.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""gare"" (he scored) in the third person singular form, while the reference translation uses the verb ""gar"" (he scored) in the third person plural form. This difference in grammar can affect the overall flow and readability of the sentence.

Based on these differences, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as moderate, with room for improvement in areas such as word choice, tense consistency, and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation, on the other hand, is of higher quality and more natural-sounding, with better word choice, tense consistency, and idiomatic expressions.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""protect"" to convey the idea of preserving local culture or language, while the reference translation uses the word ""preserve."" While both words convey a similar meaning, ""preserve"" is a more formal and technical term that is commonly used in academic or technical writing, while ""protect"" is more informal and conversational.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""should want"" in the second sentence, while the reference translation uses ""must seek."" The use of ""should want"" in the machine translation is less formal and more conversational than the use of ""must seek"" in the reference translation.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order in the second sentence, placing ""to"" before ""form."" In the reference translation, the word order is maintained, with ""form"" coming before ""to.""
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""hold economic purposes"" instead of ""achieve economic goals."" While both expressions convey a similar meaning, ""achieve economic goals"" is more formal and technical, while ""hold economic purposes"" is more conversational and idiomatic.
5. Cultural nuances: The machine translation does not capture the cultural nuances of the original Nepali sentence. For example, the use of the word ""स्थानीय"" (sthānīya) in the original sentence conveys a sense of locality or regional identity, which is not fully conveyed in the machine translation.

Overall, while the machine translation is grammatically correct, it lacks the nuance and cultural context of the reference translation. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and culturally appropriate translation of the Nepali sentence.

1. Machine translation: ""The latest method of psychological imaging is extremely harmful because of the large amount of psychological imaging on it when it beats rice from the machine.""
Reference translation: ""From the point of view of nutrients, the latter method is very harmful because when rice is threshed with this type of machine, a large amount of nutrients are lost in it.""

Difference: The machine translation uses the term ""psychological imaging"" instead of ""nutrients"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference as ""psychological imaging"" is not a term commonly used in Nepali language or culture, while ""nutrients"" is a widely recognized term in both languages.

2. Machine translation: ""पौष्टिक तत्वको दृष्टिले""
Reference translation: ""From the point of view of nutrients""

Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""पौष्टिक तत्वको दृष्टिले"" which means ""from the perspective of psychological imaging"" in Nepali. However, the reference translation uses the phrase ""From the point of view of nutrients"" which is a more accurate and common way to express this idea in English.

3. Machine translation: ""पछिल्लो विधि""
Reference translation: ""latter method""

Difference: The machine translation uses the term ""पछिल्लो विधि"" which means ""new method"" in Nepali. However, the reference translation uses the term ""latter method"" which is a more common and accurate way to express this idea in English.

4. Machine translation: ""यसप्रकारको मेसिनबाट धान कुट्दा""
Reference translation: ""a large amount of nutrients are lost in it""

Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""यसप्रकारको मेसिनबाट धान कुट्दा"" which means ""a large amount of psychological imaging is lost in it"" in Nepali. However, the reference translation uses the phrase ""a large amount of nutrients are lost in it"" which is a more accurate and common way to express this idea in English.

Overall, the machine translation makes several significant errors in this passage, including using uncommon terms, misinterpreting the meaning of words, and using inaccurate phrasing. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and natural-sounding translation of the original Nepali text.

	* Difference: The machine translation spells out the year in Nepali, while the reference translation uses the abbreviated form.
4. Punctuation:
	* Machine translation: ""जुन २९ मार्च २०११मा"" (June 29 March 2011)
	* Reference translation: ""March 29, 2011""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses Nepali punctuation, which is different from English punctuation. The reference translation uses the correct punctuation for the date.
5. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""भइन"" (released)
	* Reference translation: ""returned""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the wrong word to translate ""released"" in Nepali. The correct word is ""returned.""

Overall, the machine translation has several errors in grammar, vocabulary, spelling, punctuation, and word choice. The reference translation is more accurate and professional-sounding. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""It seems to be desirable to be careful and valuable."" (Incorrect use of ""to be"" in the infinitive form)
	* Reference translation: ""It is being tried to make meaningful and valuable."" (Correct use of ""to be"" in the present participle form)
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""desirable"" (Incorrect word choice, ""valuable"" should be used instead)
	* Reference translation: ""valuable""
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""try to be careful and valuable"" (Incorrect idiomatic expression, ""try to make meaningful and valuable"" should be used instead)
	* Reference translation: ""try to make meaningful and valuable""
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is awkward and difficult to understand.
	* Reference translation: The sentence structure is more straightforward and easier to understand.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation. The machine translation makes several grammatical errors, uses the wrong word choice, and mangles idiomatic expressions. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and natural-sounding.

Overall, the machine translation is not reliable for accurate communication, and the reference translation is the better choice for conveying the intended meaning.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""A husband and merchant named Norcasur was king."" - The sentence structure is correct, but the use of ""was"" instead of ""is"" is incorrect. The sentence should read ""A husband and merchant named Norcasur is king.""
	* Reference translation: ""There was a inhuman and immoral king named Narkasur."" - The sentence structure is correct, and the use of ""was"" is also correct.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Norcasur"" - The machine translation uses the name ""Norcasur"" instead of ""Narkasur"" which is the correct spelling in the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: ""Narkasur"" - The reference translation uses the correct spelling of the name ""Narkasur"".
3. Meaning:
	* Machine translation: ""A husband and merchant named Norcasur was king."" - The machine translation does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The reference translation implies that Narkasur was a cruel and immoral king, while the machine translation simply states that he was a husband and merchant.
	* Reference translation: ""There was a inhuman and immoral king named Narkasur."" - The reference translation conveys the same meaning as the source text, which is that Narkasur was a cruel and immoral king.
4. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: ""A husband and merchant named Norcasur was king."" - The sentence sounds awkward and unnatural in English, which is a common issue with machine translations.
	* Reference translation: ""There was a inhuman and immoral king named Narkasur."" - The reference translation sounds more natural and fluent in English.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation conveys the same meaning as the source text, uses correct grammar and vocabulary, and sounds more natural and fluent in English. The machine translation, on the other hand, contains errors in grammar, vocabulary, and meaning, and sounds awkward and unnatural in English.

* The words are repeated multiple times, which suggests that the machine translation algorithm is not able to understand the context or nuances of the original sentence.
* The translation lacks proper grammar and sentence structure, with words and phrases broken up and rearranged in a way that does not match the original Nepali sentence.

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation provides a clear and accurate translation of the original Nepali sentence.
* The words and phrases are used correctly and in the proper context, with proper grammar and sentence structure.
* The translation conveys the same meaning and tone as the original Nepali sentence.

Comparison:

* The machine translation and reference translation differ significantly in terms of accuracy and fluency.
* The machine translation provides a series of disconnected words and phrases, while the reference translation provides a coherent and accurate translation.
* The reference translation is more natural and idiomatic, while the machine translation sounds awkward and unnatural.

Conclusion:

Based on my analysis, the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation provides a clear and accurate translation of the original Nepali sentence, while the machine translation lacks proper grammar, sentence structure, and context. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation for any official or professional purposes, and using the machine translation for basic understanding or practice purposes only.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""old rules"" (पुरानो नियम)
	* Reference translation: ""old values ​​and old structures"" (पुरानो मूल्यमान्यतामा पुरानो भावना र पुरानो संरचनालाई)
	The machine translation uses the phrase ""old rules"" to translate ""पुरानो नियम"", which is a bit too literal. The reference translation uses a more idiomatic expression ""old values ​​and old structures"" to convey a broader meaning.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""the old price"" (पुरानो मूल्य)
	* Reference translation: ""old price"" (पुरानो मूल्य)
	Both translations use the same word ""old price"" to translate ""पुरानो मूल्य"", but the reference translation is more concise and direct.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""transcending old rules"" (पुरानो नियम समेत निकालेका छ)
	* Reference translation: ""old values ​​and old structures"" (पुरानो मूल्यमान्यतामा पुरानो भावना र पुरानो संरचनालाई)
	The machine translation uses a more literal translation of the idiom ""transcending old rules"" (पुरानो नियम समेत निकालेका छ), while the reference translation uses a more idiomatic expression ""old values ​​and old structures"" to convey a broader meaning.
4. Fluency and naturalness:
	* Machine translation: The translation seems a bit stilted and unnatural, with awkward phrasing and word choice.
	* Reference translation: The translation is more fluent and natural, with better phrasing and word choice that sounds more like native-level Nepali.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase "" Everything is a comparison to the Lord,"" while the reference translation uses ""Each item should be consumed only after offering it to the god along with the basil leaves."" The reference translation uses more formal and literal language, while the machine translation uses more informal and conversational language.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout, while the reference translation uses the present and past tenses. For example, in the machine translation, ""is a comparison"" is in the present tense, while in the reference translation, ""should be consumed"" is in the present tense and ""offering it"" is in the past tense.
3. Idioms and expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the reference translation. For example, the reference translation uses the phrase ""along with the basil leaves"" which is an idiomatic expression in Nepali, while the machine translation does not include this phrase.
4. Cultural references: The reference translation includes a cultural reference to the Hindu god, which is not present in the machine translation. The reference translation uses the phrase ""along with the basil leaves"" which is a common offering made to Hindu deities in Nepal.
5. Fluency: The machine translation seems to struggle with the sentence structure and word choice, resulting in a less fluent and less natural-sounding translation compared to the reference translation.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate, natural-sounding, and culturally appropriate compared to the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence better, including the idiomatic expressions and cultural references. The machine translation, on the other hand, seems to struggle with the sentence structure and word choice, resulting in a less fluent and less natural-sounding translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the machine translation for the given sentence. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source sentence: एक दिन उनीहरूले गाईले किन दूध दिइनन् भन्ने कुराको चियो गरे ।
Machine translation: One day, they worshipped why the cow didn't give milk.

Error 1: Word order
The machine translation has changed the word order of the source sentence. In the source sentence, the verb ""worshipped"" comes after the subject ""they,"" whereas in the machine translation, it comes before the subject. In Nepali, the verb usually comes after the subject.

2. Reference translation: One day they decided to find out why the cow did not give milk.

Error 2: Tense
The machine translation is in the past tense, whereas the reference translation is in the present tense. In Nepali, the verb tense usually matches the tense of the sentence.

3. Word choice
The machine translation uses the word ""worshipped"" instead of ""decided"" in the reference translation. ""Worshipped"" is a more formal term and may not be commonly used in everyday conversation.

4. Grammar
The machine translation has added an extra verb ""didn't"" in the middle of the sentence, which is not present in the source sentence or the reference translation.

Based on these errors, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as low. The translation is not accurate and does not capture the nuances of the original sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""Ashwini Kumar"" come before the verb ""delivered,"" whereas in the reference translation, they come after the verb. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with word order and sentence structure.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""delivered"") to describe the action of handing over the honeymoon, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""handed over""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Names: The machine translation uses the name ""Indra"" twice, while the reference translation uses the name ""Indradev"" once. This is a difference in spelling, and it may be due to a difference in the source text or the translator's preference.
4. Title: The machine translation does not include the title ""Maharishi Dhanwantari"" in the reference translation, while the reference translation includes it. This is a difference in the way the translator chose to render the title in English.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""delivered"" in the active voice, while the reference translation uses the verb ""handed over"" in the passive voice. This is a difference in the way the translator chose to express the action of handing over the honeymoon.
6. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation includes the phrase ""hastantarana garhe."" This is a difference in the way the translator chose to render the idiomatic expression in English.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word order, tense, names, title, grammar, and idiomatic expressions. These differences can affect the overall meaning and readability of the translation, and they may indicate that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the machine translation for the given sentence. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Grammar and syntax:
The machine translation has a correct sentence structure, with the subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern. However, there are some minor grammatical errors, such as the use of ""according to"" instead of ""depending on"" in the machine translation.
2. Vocabulary:
The machine translation uses some Nepali words, such as ""serpents"" (instead of ""snakes"" in the reference translation), which is a common mistake in machine translations. However, it also uses some proper nouns correctly, such as ""प्रजाती"" (prajati) for ""species"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation struggles to capture the idiomatic expressions in the source sentence. For example, the phrase ""लम्बाई, मोटाई"" (length, thickness) is not translated accurately, and the machine translation uses a more literal translation of ""according to"" instead of the idiomatic ""depending on"".
4. Cultural references:
The machine translation does not capture the cultural reference in the source sentence, which is a common problem in machine translations. The phrase ""serpents"" is not culturally appropriate in this context, as snakes are not typically referred to as ""serpents"" in Nepali.
5. Fluency and readability:
The machine translation is not very fluent or readable, as it uses some awkward phrasing and word choices. For example, the phrase ""their length , thickness , shape , etc. also vary"" is not very natural-sounding in Nepali.

Based on these analyses, I would give the machine translation a score of 3 out of 10 for quality. While it has some minor grammatical errors and uses some proper nouns correctly, it struggles to capture the idiomatic expressions, cultural references, and fluency of the source sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""feasts"" instead of ""fairs"" or ""festivals"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are the longest running"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was the longest running""). This difference in tense can change the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the fair has been running for a long time in the past, rather than currently.
3. Word order: In the machine translation, the words ""the longest running"" are placed at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, they are placed earlier in the sentence. This difference in word order can affect the emphasis and structure of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""Barse Mela"" to refer to the fair, while the machine translation does not use any idiomatic expression. This difference in language use can affect the naturalness and fluency of the translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""to be"" in the present tense to indicate the duration of the fair, while the reference translation uses the verb ""was"" in the past tense. This difference in grammar can affect the accuracy and consistency of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, tense, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar.

Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""added"" to indicate that the people of the villages are also participating in the Vosso Jatra, while the reference translation uses ""take part."" This subtle difference in word choice may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does show that the machine translation is not able to capture the nuances of the original Nepali sentence as accurately.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense verb form ""are"" to indicate that the people of the villages are participating in the Vosso Jatra, while the reference translation uses the future tense verb form ""are getting."" This difference in verb tense may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately capture the temporal nuances of the original Nepali sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation places the word ""size"" after the verb ""is,"" while the reference translation places it before the verb. This difference in word order may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately capture the sentence structure of the original Nepali sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""getting bigger and bigger"" to indicate the growth of the Vosso Jatra, while the machine translation does not use any idiomatic expression.

Machine Translation:

* The sentence structure is not accurate. The machine translation has changed the word order of the original sentence, which is not typical in Nepali. In Nepali, the subject usually comes before the verb.
* The word ""धृतराष्ट्रका"" (Dhritarashtra) is not translated correctly. The machine translation has changed the word ""Dhritarashtra"" to ""this joy,"" which is not a direct translation of the original word.

In the reference translation, the words are in the correct order, ""This song is composed by Claude Joseph Ruzet D Lisle in 1792.""
2. Punctuation: The machine translation lacks proper punctuation, which can make the sentence difficult to understand. For example, the machine translation does not include any punctuation after ""composed in 1792,"" which can make it unclear whether ""composed"" is the name of the song or the year it was composed. In contrast, the reference translation includes proper punctuation, making it easier to understand.
3. Accuracy of names: The machine translation contains a mistake in the spelling of the composer's name. In the machine translation, the name is spelled ""Claude Joseph Ruzet D ' Lisle,"" while in the reference translation, it is spelled ""Claude Joseph Rousseau.""
4. Grammar: The machine translation contains grammatical errors, such as the use of the present tense instead of the past tense. For example, the machine translation says ""This song is composed in 1792,"" while the reference translation says ""This song was composed in 1792.""
5. Fluency: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The machine translation uses more words than necessary to convey the same meaning, which can make it sound less natural and less fluent. For example, the machine translation says ""This song ""Claude Joseph Ruzet D ' Lisle"" is composed in 1792,"" while the reference translation says ""This song is composed by Claude Joseph Rousseau in 1792.""

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation. The machine translation contains errors in word order, punctuation, accuracy of names, grammar, and fluency, which can make it difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""parsonage"" instead of ""hiking trail"". This is a significant difference as ""parsonage"" refers to a residence for a priest or minister, while ""hiking trail"" refers to a path for hiking or walking.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""spread"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""is spread"" in the present perfect tense. This difference in verb tense does not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence, but it does indicate a difference in the way the translator chose to express the idea.
3. Phrasing: The machine translation uses a more literal translation of the Nepali phrase ""त्यस्तै यो पदमार्ग"" (tyastai yo padmarag), which means ""like this parsonage"". The reference translation uses a more natural and idiomatic phrase ""this hiking trail"" to convey the same meaning.
4. Names of countries: The machine translation uses the names of countries in their original forms (Tibet, India, Myanmar, Pakistan), while the reference translation uses the commonly used abbreviations (Tibet, India, Myanmar, Pakistan). This difference is minor and does not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, grammar, phrasing, and naming conventions. While the machine translation is generally accurate, the reference translation is more natural and idiomatic, and better conveys the intended meaning of the Nepali phrase.

Machine Translation:

* The sentence is grammatically correct, but the meaning is not accurate.
* The phrase ""those who have a name joined"" is not a correct translation of the Nepali phrase ""खप्तडी भनेर नाम जोडीएकाहरुको मूल"" which means ""the place of origin of those whose name is related to Khaptadi"".
* The word ""joined"" does not convey the same meaning as ""related"" in Nepali.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""Northern Falguni"" instead of ""Uttara Falguni"" in the reference translation.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb form ""is"" instead of ""consellation"" in the reference translation.
3. Spelling: The machine translation spells ""Falguni"" as ""Falguni"" in both instances, while the reference translation spells it as ""Falguni"" in the first instance and ""Falguni"" in the second instance.
4. Capitalization: The machine translation does not capitalize the word ""Northern"" in the first instance, while the reference translation capitalizes it in the second instance.
5. Punctuation: The machine translation does not use any punctuation after ""twelfth"" in the first instance, while the reference translation uses a comma after ""twelfth"" in the second instance.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""dealt"" instead of ""married"" to describe the relationship between Lewesk and Stephinie Mcmain. This is a significant difference, as ""dealt"" implies a more formal or business-like relationship, while ""married"" conveys a more personal and emotional bond.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the past tense form of the verb ""complete"" instead of the present perfect tense in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""the pair completed a deal in court"" instead of ""the couple was legally married in 2003."" This is a significant difference, as the phrase ""pair"" is not commonly used to refer to a married couple, and the reference translation uses a more idiomatic expression to convey the idea of a legal marriage.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation incorrectly uses the word ""Lewesk"" instead of ""Lévesque."" This is a significant difference, as the correct name is Lévesque, and it affects the accuracy of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and accuracy.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""The Prominent Gautama Buddha of Buddhism went from here in his last days."" - The use of ""Prominent"" to describe Gautama Buddha is not accurate. In Nepali, ""Prominent"" is not a commonly used word to describe a person.
	* Reference translation: ""Gautama Buddha , the founder of Buddhism , had gone from here in his last days."" - This translation uses the correct word ""founder"" to describe Gautama Buddha, which is more accurate than the machine translation.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""बौद्ध धर्मका"" - This is not a correct phrase in Nepali. The correct phrase is ""बौद्ध धर्म का"".
	* Reference translation: ""Gautama Buddha , the founder of Buddhism , had gone from here in his last days."" - This translation uses the correct phrase ""बौद्ध धर्म का"" to refer to Gautama Buddha's teachings.
3. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""The Prominent Gautama Buddha of Buddhism went from here in his last days."" - The sentence structure is not accurate in Nepali. In Nepali, the sentence would be structured as ""गौतम बुद्ध आफ्नो अन्तिम दिनहरूमा यहाँबाट गएका थिए.""
	* Reference translation: ""Gautama Buddha , the founder of Buddhism , had gone from here in his last days."" - This translation uses the correct sentence structure for Nepali.
4. Word choice:

Reference Translation:

* ""Other verses are also used in the paragraphs like Stuti . As Arjuna expressed regret in the first chapter , it is called Arjuna Vishadyoga chapter .""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""parsonage"" instead of ""Stuti"" which is the correct term in Nepali.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb tense inconsistently. In the first sentence, it uses the present tense (""pursued poetry"") but in the second sentence, it uses the past tense (""expressed regret""). In the reference translation, the verb tense is consistent throughout.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the original Nepali text. For example, ""argus poetic chapter"" is not a common or idiomatic expression in English, while ""Arjuna Vishadyoga chapter"" is a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Nepali term.
4. Sentence structure: The machine translation does not follow the same sentence structure as the reference translation. The machine translation uses a longer sentence with multiple clauses, while the reference translation uses shorter sentences with simpler structures.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""duty of wealth and experience"" while the reference translation uses ""lack of wealth and splendor."" The reference translation uses a more idiomatic phrase that is more commonly used in Nepali.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is no"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was no""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""newborn"" to refer to a person who is born recently, while the machine translation does not use any idiomatic expression.
4. Fluency: The machine translation seems to struggle with the word order in the sentence, resulting in an awkward and unnatural sentence structure. The reference translation, on the other hand, has a more fluid and natural sentence structure.

	* Reference translation: ""Those who have been displaced from the animal husbandry business have since been forced to work as wage laborers and watchmen in neighboring India for alternative employment.""

The machine translation uses a more informal and conversational tone, with a simpler sentence structure. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses more formal language and a more complex sentence structure, which better conveys the intended meaning.

2. Vocabulary:

	* Reference translation: ""wage laborers and watchmen""

The machine translation uses the Nepali word ""मजदुरी"" (majuri), which can be translated to ""laborers"" or ""workers"". However, the reference translation uses a more specific term, ""wage laborers and watchmen"", which better conveys the type of work that these individuals are doing.

3. Idiomatic expressions:

The machine translation uses the term ""बिबश"" (Bibsh), which is a colloquialism in Nepali. While this term may be commonly used in informal conversation, it may not be appropriate in formal writing or translation. The reference translation uses a more formal term, ""neighboring India"", which better conveys the geographical location of the work.

4. Cultural references:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Makhan"" (butter) is translated as ""stolen"" in the machine translation, which is not the most accurate word choice. In Nepali, ""stolen"" means something that has been taken away without permission, whereas ""Makhan"" specifically refers to butter.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the word ""butter"" correctly, which is a more accurate translation of the Nepali word ""Makhan"".
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the present tense ""comes"" instead of the past tense ""came"" in the source text. This is a common error in machine translations, as they often struggle to recognize and translate verb tenses correctly.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the past tense ""came"" correctly, which is in line with the source text.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""यसरी दिन दिनै"" (on the same day) correctly. In Nepali, this expression is used to indicate that something happened on the same day as something else, but the machine translation translates it as ""And it came to pass on the same day"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation captures the idiomatic expression correctly, using ""on the same day"" to convey the same meaning as the source text.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, placing ""Makhan"" before ""gathered"". In Nepali, the word order is typically SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), so the sentence should read ""all the gopinis gathered at Yashoda's house and complained to Krishna"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the original word order of the source text, which is more accurate.
5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the cultural reference to ""Gopinites"" correctly. In Nepali culture, ""Gopinis"" are the female cowherds who take care of Krishna as a baby, so the reference translation should use ""Gopinis"" instead of ""Gopinites"".

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""And all the priesthood came to Mr. Jeshoda's house.""
	* Reference translation: ""After that, all the Gopis took Shree Krishna to Yashoda's house.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the term ""priesthood"" instead of ""Gopis"". ""Priesthood"" refers to a group of priests or religious leaders, while ""Gopis"" specifically refers to the female devotees of Lord Krishna.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is different in the machine translation. It uses a more formal and literal translation, with a subject-verb-object word order.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the same sentence structure as the original Nepali sentence, with a more natural and conversational word order.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the original Nepali sentence. For example, ""त्यस पछि"" (tyas pachi) is an idiomatic expression used to indicate a large number of people, which is not translated accurately in the machine translation.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation captures the idiomatic expressions used in the original Nepali sentence, such as ""त्यस पछि"" (tyas pachi).
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the original Nepali sentence. For example, ""Yashoda"" is a name that is specific to Hindu culture, and is not commonly used in other cultures.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation captures the cultural context of the original Nepali sentence, using the name ""Yashoda"" which is specific to Hindu culture.
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation may not be as fluent or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation is more polished and natural-sounding, with a better flow of words.
6. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation may not be as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate, as it takes into account the nuances of the Nepali language and culture.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Nepali language and culture more accurately, and is more fluent and natural-sounding. The machine translation, on the other hand, may not be as accurate or natural-sounding, and may not capture the cultural context of the original Nepali sentence.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""in the morning"" are placed at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, they are placed at the beginning.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""arose"" to translate the Nepali verb ""एकाबिहानै"" (ekābihāna), while the reference translation uses the present tense ""woke up"" to translate the same verb. This suggests that the machine translation may not have accurately captured the nuances of the Nepali verb tenses.
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""eaten"" to translate the Nepali word ""खाना"" (khaṇā), which means ""food"". While ""eaten"" is a valid translation, it may not be the most idiomatic or natural choice in this context. The reference translation uses the word ""food"" instead, which is more in line with the original Nepali text.
4. Grammar: The machine translation has a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the verb "" arose"" is in the third person singular form, while in the reference translation, it is in the third person plural form. This may indicate that the machine translation has difficulty with Nepali verb conjugation.

Overall, the machine translation appears to have made several errors in word order, tense, word choice, and grammar. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and natural-sounding. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further translation work, and making any necessary adjustments to ensure that the translation is as accurate and natural-sounding as possible.

1. Grammar: The machine translation has a few grammatical errors. For example, it uses the verb ""growing"" instead of ""increases"" in the second sentence. The reference translation correctly uses the verb ""increases.""
2. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""harder"" twice in the first sentence, which is unnecessary and repetitive. The reference translation avoids this mistake by using the word ""working"" instead of ""harder"" in the second sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""कडा परिश्रम लाग्ने"" (kada parishram laagne) which means ""working hard"" in Nepali. The reference translation correctly translates this expression as ""working harder.""
4. Tone: The machine translation has a more formal tone than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more conversational tone, which is more appropriate for everyday language use.
5. Cultural nuances: The machine translation does not capture the cultural nuances of the Nepali language. For example, the phrase ""समयसम्म कडा परिश्रम लाग्ने"" (samaysamman kada parishram laagne) is a common expression in Nepali that means ""working hard for a long time."" The reference translation correctly captures this cultural nuance by using the phrase ""growing more with time.""

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Nepali language and culture better, and its grammar and word choice are more correct.

Machine Translation:

* ""Each drop of blood is one characteristic"" should be ""Every drop of blood has the same characteristic""
	+ The machine translation uses the word ""one"" instead of ""same"" to convey the idea of uniformity, which is not accurate.
	+ The phrase ""each drop of blood"" is repeated twice, which makes the sentence sound repetitive and awkward.
* ""the same is one"" should be ""every grain of rice is the same""
	+ The machine translation changes the meaning of the original sentence by using the word ""is"" instead of ""are"".
	+ The phrase ""the same"" is used twice in a row, which is unnecessary and makes the sentence sound repetitive.

Reference Translation:

* ""Each drop of blood has the same characteristic"" is a more accurate translation of the original Nepali sentence.
	+ The word ""same"" is used correctly to convey the idea of uniformity.
	+ The sentence is concise and easy to read.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The machine translation makes two significant errors: using the wrong word (i.e., ""one"" instead of ""same"") and changing the meaning of the sentence (i.e., using ""is"" instead of ""are""). Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating than the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""sacrifice"" to translate the Nepali word ""देवीको"" (devi ko), which means ""of the goddess"". However, the reference translation uses the word ""offer"" to translate the same word, which is more appropriate in this context.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""sacrifice"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""bid farewell"" in the past tense. This is because the reference translation is trying to convey that the women are saying goodbye to the goddess, whereas the machine translation is implying that they are still sacrificing the lion.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""the shire of the goddess"" to translate the Nepali phrase ""देवीको शीरमा"" (devi ko shirema), which is an idiomatic expression that means ""the goddess's abode"". The reference translation uses the phrase ""the goddess's home"" to convey the same meaning.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, placing ""the lion"" before ""the goddess"". In the reference translation, the word order is maintained, with ""the goddess"" appearing first.
5. Tone: The machine translation seems to convey a sense of fear or reverence towards the goddess, while the reference translation conveys a sense of sadness or longing. This is because the reference translation uses the word ""bid farewell"" to convey a sense of finality, while the machine translation uses the word ""sacrifice"" to convey a sense of reverence.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Nepali language better, and conveys the intended meaning of the sentence more clearly.

The word ""idenfication"" is not a commonly used term in Nepali, and "" matters relating to disease recognition"" would be a more appropriate translation.
* ""2.5 million people may suffer from COPD"" is a more accurate translation of the original Nepali sentence. The word ""suffer"" is a more appropriate verb to use in this context, as it conveys the idea of experiencing discomfort or harm.

Overall, the machine translation makes several errors in both the grammar and vocabulary of the sentence. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali sentence.

1. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Marriage and bankruptcy"" (MT) vs. ""Marriage and marital relation"" (Reference)
		+ MT uses the phrase ""marriage and bankruptcy"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. In Nepali, ""marriage"" is often referred to as ""vivah"" or ""vivaha,"" and ""marital relation"" would be ""vivah-bhaw"" or ""vivaha-bhaw.""
		+ Reference translation uses the more common and accurate term ""vivah-bhaw"" to translate ""marital relation.""
2. Grammar and sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Nature, diversity and change"" (MT) vs. ""Nature, diversity and Changes"" (Reference)
		+ MT uses a different sentence structure and word order than the reference translation. In Nepali, the word order is typically SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), so ""Nature, diversity and change"" would be more accurately translated as ""Nature, diversity, and changes.""
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Prakriti, vividhatā and parivartan"" (MT) vs. ""Prakriti, vividhatā and parivartan"" (Reference)

	* Reference translation: ""Likewise , Ghana 's Jonathan Mensa""

The machine translation uses the word ""of"" to indicate the location of Jonathan Mensah, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""Ghana 's"" to indicate that Jonathan Mensah is from Ghana.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Lee Addy and Anthony Anan also received a yellow card.""
	* Reference translation: ""Likewise , Lee Eddy and Anthony Annan also received yellow cards.""

The machine translation uses the singular form ""a yellow card"" for both Lee Addy and Anthony Anan, while the reference translation uses the plural form ""yellow cards"" for both of them.

3. Spelling:
	* Machine translation: ""Jonathan Mensah""
	* Reference translation: ""Jonathan Mensa""

The machine translation spells Jonathan Mensah's name with an ""a"" instead of an ""a"" in the reference translation.

4. Punctuation:

The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the word ""material"" to translate ""भौतिक"" (bhautik), which is a more specific term that refers to sufferings that arise from material or worldly causes.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""do not pick up much"") to translate ""धेरै टिक्दैन्"" (dheraina tikdaina), which is in the present tense. The reference translation uses the past tense (""do not last long"") to translate ""धेरै टिक्दैन्"" (dheraina tikdaina), which is a more accurate translation of the original Nepali sentence.
3. Idiomatic expression: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""सन्तुष्ट रहने"" (santustha rahne) in the original Nepali sentence. This phrase is a common idiom in Nepali that means ""to be satisfied with something,"" and it is not directly equivalent to the English phrase ""Krishna consciousness.""
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""do not"" in the subject position, which is not grammatically correct in Nepali. In Nepali, the verb ""do not"" is typically used in the auxiliary position, as in ""do not pick up much."" The reference translation correctly uses the verb ""do not"" in the auxiliary position.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""मध्यपश्चिमबाट"" (madhypashchimbat) is translated as ""Midwest"" in the machine translation, but the reference translation uses ""Volleyball"" instead.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The verb tense in the machine translation is inconsistent. The sentence ""he lost the opportunity"" is in the past tense, but the verb ""was chosen"" is in the present tense. In the reference translation, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""स्वास्थ्यमा समस्या"" (swaasthyaama samasya) which means ""a problem with health"". In the reference translation, this expression is accurately translated as ""problem with health"".
4. Word order:

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the machine translation and the reference translation for the given Nepali sentence.

Step 1: Reading and Understanding the Source Text

The source text is: त्यो बाण माछाको पेटमा भेटिएको मुशलको टुक्राबाट बनेको हुनाले कृष्णको मृत्यु त्यसै बाणबाट भयो (Because the arrow was made out of a piece of mushroom found in the fish's belly, the death of the arrow came from the same fish.)

Step 2: Machine Translation Analysis

The machine translation provided is: Because the arrow was made out of a piece of mushroom found in the fish's belly, the death of the arrow came from the same fish.

Comparison with the Source Text:

* The machine translation keeps the basic meaning of the sentence, but there are some differences in the word choice and grammar.
* The machine translation uses the word ""mushroom"" instead of ""Mushal"" (which is the correct word in Nepali).
* The machine translation uses the present tense ""is"" instead of the past tense ""came"" in the source text.

Step 3: Reference Translation Analysis

The reference translation provided is: Since that arrow was made of a piece of Mushal found in the stomach of a fish, Krishna died from the same arrow.

Comparison with the Source Text:

* The reference translation keeps the same meaning and word choice as the source text.
* The reference translation uses the correct Nepali word ""Mushal"" instead of ""mushroom"".
* The reference translation uses the past tense ""died"" instead of the present tense ""came"" in the source text.

Step 4: Quality Evaluation

Based on the analysis, the quality of the machine translation is lower than the reference translation. The machine translation has some errors in word choice and grammar, which can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, has a more accurate and natural-sounding translation.

Overall, the reference translation is a better quality translation than the machine translation.

Machine Translation:

* ""Singaru has not been replaced except for the full period of the dance.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Once the Singaru is formed, no one except the same people can be changed the entire duration of the dance.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""replaced"" instead of ""changed"" in the reference translation.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""has not been replaced"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was formed"").
3. Word order: In the machine translation, the word ""except"" is placed after the verb ""has not been replaced"" instead of before it, as in the reference translation.
4. Idiomatic expression: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""the entire duration of the dance"" to convey the idea of the duration of the Singaru, while the machine translation does not use any idiomatic expression.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""replace"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""be changed"" in the past tense.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the Nepali sentence. The differences in word choice, tense, word order, idiomatic expression, and grammar all contribute to a lower quality translation.

  As a helpful assistant, I will provide a detailed analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given Nepali sentence.

Machine Translation:

* ""Each male members of the yogi government have traditional assignments to be fucked once again by fucking mandatory in life.""

Reference Translation:

* ""There is a customary belief that male member of Jogi community has to once again in life time compulsorily move around by fukera.""

Differences:

1. Grammar: The machine translation has several grammatical errors, including the use of ""have"" instead of ""has"" in the subject, and the incorrect use of the verb ""to be"" in the phrase ""fucked once again."" In contrast, the reference translation maintains correct grammar throughout the sentence.
2. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses vulgar language, specifically the word ""fuck,"" which is not present in the reference translation. This suggests that the machine translation may not have been trained on appropriate language for certain contexts.
3. Cultural sensitivity: The machine translation appears to be culturally insensitive, as it uses language that may be considered offensive or inappropriate in certain cultures. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses more culturally appropriate language to convey the same meaning.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not appear to understand idiomatic expressions, as it translates ""fukera"" as ""fucking mandatory,"" which is not a correct interpretation of the phrase. The reference translation, however, uses the correct idiomatic expression ""compulsorily move around.""
5. Tone: The machine translation has a more informal tone, which may not be appropriate for all contexts. The reference translation, on the other hand, maintains a more formal tone that is more suitable for certain contexts.

In conclusion, the machine translation and the reference translation differ significantly in terms of grammar, vocabulary, cultural sensitivity, idiomatic expressions, and tone. As a helpful assistant, I would recommend using the reference translation for any formal or professional contexts, while the machine translation may be more appropriate for informal or casual contexts.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""by snakes"" - This word doesn't exist in Nepali. The correct word is ""by Brahmins"" or ""by priests"".
	* Reference translation: ""after taking a bath"" - This sentence is more accurate than the machine translation.
3. Sentence structure:

	* Reference translation: ""Lord Rama"" (This is a more accurate and common way to translate ""Bhagwan"" in Nepali)
2. Grammar:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""blaming"" instead of ""protesting"" to convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence. This is a common error in machine translations, as they often struggle to accurately capture the nuances of language.
2. Tone: The machine translation gives a more formal and impersonal tone compared to the reference translation, which has a more conversational tone. This is because the machine translation uses more formal language to convey the meaning, while the reference translation uses more informal language to make it sound more natural.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense for the verb ""demonstrated"" instead of the past tense ""protested"" to match the tense of the source sentence. However, this can make the translation sound less natural and less accurate.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""आक्रमणको निन्दा"" (akramanko ninda) in the source sentence, which means ""criticizing the attack."" This is a common error in machine translations, as they often struggle to understand and translate idiomatic expressions accurately.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation does not capture the cultural reference in the source sentence, which is specific to the Nepali language and culture.

3. Nepali word usage: The reference translation uses the Nepali word ""jhulunge"" instead of ""bridges"" to refer to the type of bridge being constructed. This is a significant difference, as it reflects the local terminology and cultural context of Nepal.
4. Sentence structure: The machine translation uses a more straightforward sentence structure, with a simple subject-verb-object structure. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses a more complex sentence structure with a relative clause.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses an idiomatic expression ""पुलहरूको निर्माण कार्य सम्पन्न भैसकेको छ"" which is more commonly used in Nepali language. The machine translation doesn't use any idiomatic expressions.

Analysis:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""victims"" instead of ""yoga"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""yoga"" is the correct term in Nepali, and ""victims"" is not a suitable translation for it.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present participle form of the verb ""incremental"" instead of the present tense form ""victory"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expression: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""yoga called victory"" instead of ""sum of the victims"" in the machine translation. This is a significant difference, as the idiomatic expression in Nepali conveys a different meaning than the literal translation of the machine translation.
4. Fluency: The machine translation seems to struggle with the word order in Nepali, as it places the word ""for"" at the end of the sentence instead of at the beginning. This can make the sentence sound less fluent and natural in Nepali.

3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""entertainer"" which is not commonly used in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses the word ""some"" which is more commonly used in Nepali.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout, while the reference translation uses the present and past tenses. For example, the machine translation says ""studies and research for someone who is a tourism entertainer"" while the reference translation says ""For some, tourism is entertainment while for others, study and research.""
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""tourism is entertainment"" which is commonly used in Nepali.
6. Cultural context: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of Nepal, where tourism is not always seen as entertainment. In contrast, the reference translation acknowledges this cultural context by using the phrase ""for some"" which implies that not everyone in Nepal views tourism as entertainment.

Overall, the machine translation seems to be more informal and lacks cultural context, while the reference translation is more formal and takes into account the cultural context of Nepal.

Machine Translation (MT): Mcmain was not a WWF Team present until 2000.

Reference Translation (RT): Mcmain had not mentioned his presence in the WWF Team until 2000.

The main differences between the MT and RT are:

1. Tense: The MT uses the past tense ""was"" to indicate that Mcmain was not a part of the WWF Team in the past, while the RT uses the past perfect tense ""had not mentioned"" to convey that Mcmain had not mentioned his presence in the WWF Team until 2000.
2. Verb agreement: In the MT, the verb ""was"" does not agree with the subject ""Mcmain"" in number, as it is in the singular form. In contrast, the RT uses the plural form of the verb ""had not mentioned"" to match the plural subject ""Mcmain and his presence"".
3. Word choice: The MT uses the word ""present"" to indicate Mcmain's absence from the WWF Team, while the RT uses the word ""mentioned"" to convey that Mcmain had not mentioned his presence in the WWF Team until 2000.
4. Idiomatic expression: The RT uses a more idiomatic expression ""had not mentioned"" to convey the idea that Mcmain had not talked about his presence in the WWF Team until 2000, while the MT uses a more literal translation of the Nepali sentence.

Overall, the RT provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Nepali sentence compared to the MT. The RT's use of the past perfect tense, verb agreement, and idiomatic expression all contribute to a more natural and fluent translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation keeps the word order of the source language, which is Nepali, in the translation. In Nepali, the subject-object-verb (SOV) word order is used, whereas in English, the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order is more common. For example, in the source sentence ""कुन पुस्तक वितरणमा हुन्छ,"" the word order is SOV (कुन पुस्तक वितरणमा हुन्छ), but in the machine translation, it is kept the same (Which book is in distribution, which reference books?).
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense in both parts of the sentence, whereas the reference translation uses the past tense in the second part of the sentence. In Nepali, the past tense is marked using the suffix ""-े"" or ""-ें"" on the verb, as in ""कुन पुस्तक वितरणमा हुन्छ"" (Which book is in distribution).
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""distribution"" instead of ""distribution"" in the reference translation. In Nepali, the word ""वितरण"" (vitran) means ""distribution,"" but in English, ""distribution"" is a more common term used to refer to the act of making something available for sale or use.
4. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a more literal translation of the Nepali sentence, whereas the reference translation uses a more idiomatic English sentence structure. For example, in the machine translation, the phrase ""which book is in distribution"" is used, whereas in the reference translation, the phrase ""which is the reference books"" is used.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present perfect tense in the second part of the sentence, which is not necessary in English. In the reference translation, the past tense is used to refer to the books that are being referred to as ""reference books.""

Overall, the machine translation is more literal and keeps the word order of the source language, but it also makes some grammatical errors and uses less common English phrases. The reference translation is more idiomatic and uses more common English phrases, but it also changes the word order and tense to better fit the English language.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""polarities"" instead of ""substance"" in the reference translation. While ""polarities"" can refer to opposing or contrasting qualities, it doesn't quite convey the same meaning as ""substance"" in this context.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""cannot be changed"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""cannot change."" This difference in verb tense may not significantly affect the overall meaning, but it does make the sentence structure slightly different.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""speed of nature"" instead of ""motion of nature"" in the reference translation. While both phrases convey the idea of movement or change, the reference translation uses a more common and idiomatic expression in Nepali.
4. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the two clauses in the reference translation. In the reference translation, the phrase ""materiality cannot change"" comes before the phrase ""according to the motion of nature."" In the machine translation, the word order is reversed, with ""according to the motion of nature"" coming before ""materiality cannot change.""
5. Translation of key terms: The machine translation uses the word ""physiology"" instead of ""materiality"" in the reference translation. While both terms refer to the study of the structure and function of living organisms, ""physiology"" is a more general term that can refer to the study of any living organism, while ""materiality"" specifically refers to the material or physical aspects of living things.

Overall, the machine translation does not capture the nuances of the reference translation as well as it could. The use of ""polarities"" instead of ""substance,"" the verb tense difference, and the idiomatic expression used in the reference translation are all examples of how the machine translation could be improved. However, it's worth noting that machine translation is a complex task and can be challenging to produce high-quality translations, especially for languages with complex grammar and syntax like Nepali.

Machine Translation:

* ""And it came to pass, that Issara was gone, saying, Issara was gone.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Pratihar hinted that they were the ones who would break down the main gate.""

Key differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""gone"" twice, which is not necessary and can make the sentence sound repetitive and unclear. In contrast, the reference translation uses the word ""hinted"" to convey a more subtle and nuanced meaning.
2. Tense consistency: The machine translation switches between past and present tense, which can make the sentence sound awkward and confusing. The reference translation maintains a consistent past tense throughout the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""Pratihar hinted"" in the reference translation, which is a common way to convey the idea of suggesting or implying something in Nepali.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""was gone"" in the present tense, which is not necessary in this context. The reference translation uses the past tense of the verb ""break down"" to indicate that the action of breaking down the main gate happened in the past.

Overall, the machine translation falls short in conveying the intended meaning of the original Nepali sentence, and the reference translation provides a more accurate and natural-sounding translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""went through"" instead of ""became more powerful."" ""Went through"" is a more formal and literal translation of the Nepali word ""शक्तिशाली हुँदै,"" but it doesn't convey the same level of power and influence as ""became more powerful.""
2. Tense: The machine translation is in the past tense, while the reference translation is in the present tense. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the Nepali sentence, placing ""corruption and political instability"" before ""the maoists."" In the reference translation, the word order is closer to the original Nepali sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""माओवादीहरू"" (maoists) in the same way as the reference translation. ""माओवादी"" is a term that refers specifically to the Maoist political party in Nepal, and ""हरू"" is a suffix that indicates possession or belonging.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation doesn't take into account the cultural context of the sentence, which is important in Nepali language translation. For example, the term ""माओवादी"" is a cultural reference that is specific to Nepal and the Maoist political movement.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or nuanced as the reference translation in conveying the meaning and context of the original Nepali sentence. While machine translation can be a useful tool for quick and rough translations, it's important to have a human translator review and edit the translation to ensure that it's accurate and culturally appropriate.

Machine Translation:

* ""These were the three generations of Satan"" is not a correct translation of the Nepali sentence ""यी तीन सन्तान"". The word ""Satan"" is not a proper noun in Nepali, and it does not have any specific meaning. In this context, it seems that the machine translation has misunderstood the word ""Satan"" as a proper noun, which is not the case.
* ""who were mighty men and workmen"" is a poor translation of the Nepali phrase ""मध्य शतानन्द अत्यन्त सिद्ध र कर्मकाण्डका प्रकाण्ड"". The machine translation has mistranslated the word ""मध्य"" as ""mighty men"", which is not the correct meaning of the word. In Nepali, ""मध्य"" means ""middle"" or ""midway"", and it is used to describe a location or a point in time.
* ""workmen"" is not a correct translation of the Nepali word ""कर्मकाण्डका"". The machine translation has mistakenly used the word ""workmen"" instead of the correct translation ""cultural practices"".

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation. It correctly translates the Nepali word ""यी तीन सन्तान"" as ""these three children"", which is the correct meaning of the sentence.
* The reference translation correctly translates the Nepali phrase ""मध्य शतानन्द अत्यन्त सिद्ध र कर्मकाण्डका प्रकाण्ड"" as ""Of these three children, Shatananda was highly enlightened and brilliant in cultural practices"". The word ""Satananda"" is a proper noun in Nepali, and it refers to a specific person. The reference translation has correctly translated the word ""Satananda"" as a proper noun, which is not the case in the machine translation.
* The reference translation correctly translates the Nepali word ""कर्मकाण्डका"" as ""cultural practices"", which is the correct meaning of the word.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation for the given sentence. The machine translation has made several mistakes in translating the Nepali words and phrases, which results in an inaccurate translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""टेस्ला"" (Tesla) instead of the reference translation's ""Tesla and his team"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""abandoned"") instead of the reference translation's past tense (""abandoned forever""). This difference in verb tense is more significant than the word choice difference, as it affects the time frame in which the action of abandoning the project took place.
3. Fluency: The machine translation seems to have some awkward phrasing, such as ""टेस्ला र उनको टिमले"" (Tesla and his team abandoned). This is a more noticeable difference than the previous two, as it affects the overall flow and readability of the sentence.
4. Idiomaticity: The machine translation does not seem to capture the idiomatic expression ""उनको टिमले"" (abandoned forever) used in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as idiomatic expressions are important for conveying the intended meaning and context of a sentence.
5. Cultural appropriateness: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the sentence, as ""टेस्ला"" (Tesla) is a name of a person and not a Nepali word. This is a more subtle difference, but it can affect the overall accuracy and appropriateness of the translation.

Based on these differences, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as moderate, with room for improvement in areas such as word choice, grammar, fluency, idiomaticity, and cultural appropriateness.

3. Pronouns: The machine translation uses the pronoun ""he"" to refer to Ray Morgan, while the reference translation uses the pronoun ""he"" again in the second sentence to refer to the same person.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""later"" to indicate the time period after which Ray Morgan became the commentator, while the reference translation uses the word ""later"" to indicate a more general time period.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses a more simplified grammar structure than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the present simple tense for the verb ""replacing,"" while the reference translation uses the past simple tense.
6. Fluency: The machine translation seems to struggle with the fluency of the sentence, as it uses a more stilted and formal language than the reference translation.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Mandela himself has said that her name is not true to be added to others, except some educational institutions."" (incorrect use of ""her"" instead of ""his"")
	* Reference translation: ""But Mandela himself said that relating his name with educational institutions except some is not correct."" (correct use of ""his"")
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""her name"" (incorrect use of gendered pronoun)
	* Reference translation: ""his name"" (correct use of gendered pronoun)
3. Tense:
	* Machine translation: present tense (""is not true"")
	* Reference translation: past tense (""was not correct"")
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""added to others"" (incorrect use of idiomatic expression)
	* Reference translation: ""relating his name with educational institutions"" (correct use of idiomatic expression)
5. Contextual understanding:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not take into account the context of the sentence, which is a quote from Nelson Mandela.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation understands the context of the sentence and provides a more accurate translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of grammar, word choice, tense, idiomatic expressions, and contextual understanding. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more reliable and accurate translation of the given sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""mada"" for the goddess, while the reference translation uses ""Maryada"" (मार्यादा). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Gender agreement: In the machine translation, the word ""ram"" is in the masculine gender, while in the reference translation, it is in the neuter gender (राम). This is a more significant difference, as it affects the gender of the noun ""Ram"" in the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the words ""goddess mada"" together, while the reference translation separates them with a comma. This is a minor difference in word order, but it can affect the overall flow of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""came here"" (आएको), which is a more literal translation of the Nepali phrase ""यहाँ आएको"" (yaha aeeko). The reference translation uses the more idiomatic expression ""came"" (र आएको), which is more commonly used in Nepali.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""came"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""came"" in the past tense (र आएको). This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame of the action being described.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, gender agreement, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. While the machine translation is generally understandable, there are some areas where it could be improved to better convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar: The machine translation has several grammatical errors. For example, it uses the verb ""ashamed"" in the present tense throughout, even though the original sentence is in the past tense. In contrast, the reference translation correctly uses the past tense of the verb ""ashamed"" to match the original sentence.
2. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""ashamed"" repeatedly, while the reference translation uses a more varied vocabulary. For example, the reference translation uses the word ""embarrassment"" to convey a different shade of meaning than the machine translation's repeated use of ""ashamed"".
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the original sentence. For example, the phrase ""तेजहीन तथा अभिमानशून्य"" is a common idiomatic expression in Nepali, but the machine translation does not translate it accurately.
4. Cultural references: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the original sentence. For example, the phrase ""परशुराम एक वर्षसम्म"" is a reference to a well-known story in Nepali culture, but the machine translation does not recognize this cultural reference.
5. Fluency: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The reference translation has a more natural and fluent flow, while the machine translation sounds awkward and stilted.

Overall, the machine translation falls short in terms of accuracy, vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, cultural references, and fluency. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and natural-sounding translation of the original Nepali sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given source:

1. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Nepal police volunteer"" (नेपाल प्रहरी अस्पताल)
	* Reference translation: ""Concept of Nepal Police Hospital and Nepal Police School"" (नेपाल प्रहरी अस्पताल र नेपाल प्रहरी विद्यालयको परिकल्पना)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the term ""volunteer"" (अस्पताल), which is not a direct equivalent of the Nepali term ""प्रहरी"" (prahari). The reference translation uses the phrase ""Concept of Nepal Police Hospital and Nepal Police School"" which is a more accurate translation of the Nepali term ""नेपाल प्रहरी अस्पताल र नेपाल प्रहरी विद्यालयको परिकल्पना"".
2. Grammar and sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Nepal police volunteer and alternative to Nepal police school"" (नेपाल प्रहरी अस्पताल र नेपाल प्रहरी विद्यालयको परिकल्पना)
	* Reference translation: ""Concept of Nepal Police Hospital and Nepal Police School"" (नेपाल प्रहरी अस्पताल र नेपाल प्रहरी विद्यालयको परिकल्पना)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a compound sentence with two independent clauses, while the reference translation uses a simple sentence with a single subject.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Nepal police volunteer and alternative to Nepal police school"" (नेपाल प्रहरी अस्पताल र नेपाल प्रहरी विद्यालयको परिकल्पना)
	* Reference translation: ""Concept of Nepal Police Hospital and Nepal Police School"" (नेपाल प्रहरी अस्पताल र नेपाल प्रहरी विद्यालयको परिकल्पना)
	* Difference: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the Nepali sentence. For example, the phrase ""नेपाल प्रहरी"" (nepal prahari) is an idiomatic expression that means ""Nepal Police"", and the phrase ""नेपाल प्रहरी विद्यालय"" (nepal prahari vidyalaya) means ""Nepal Police School"".
4. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: ""Nepal police volunteer and alternative to Nepal police school"" (नेपाल प्रहरी अस्पताल र नेपाल प्रहरी विद्यालयको परिकल्पना)
	* Reference translation: ""Concept of Nepal Police Hospital and Nepal Police School"" (नेपाल प्रहरी अस्पताल र नेपाल प्रहरी विद्यालयको परिकल्पना)
	* Difference: The machine translation does not capture the cultural nuances of the Nepali sentence. For example, the phrase ""नेपाल प्रहरी"" (nepal prahari) is a cultural reference that is specific to Nepal, and the phrase ""नेपाल प्रहरी विद्यालय"" (nepal prahari vidyalaya) is a term that is commonly used in Nepal to refer to a police school.

Overall, the machine translation does not capture the nuances of the Nepali sentence as accurately as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally relevant translation of the Nepali sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word-for-word translation:
	* Machine translation: ""My adversaries have nothing, how have I been your adversaries?""
	* Reference translation: ""I don't have any enmity with you, how did I become your enemy?""

The machine translation uses the word ""adversaries"" instead of ""enmity"" in the reference translation. This is a common mistake in machine translation, as the software may not always understand the nuances of the language.

2. Grammar and sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""My adversaries have nothing, how have I been your adversaries?""
	* Reference translation: ""I don't have any enmity with you, how did I become your enemy?""

The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the original Nepali sentence. In the reference translation, the sentence is structured as a question, while in the machine translation, it is structured as a statement.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""My adversaries have nothing, how have I been your adversaries?""
	* Reference translation: ""I don't have any enmity with you, how did I become your enemy?""

The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""shatru"" (adversary) in the original Nepali sentence. In the reference translation, the word ""enmity"" is used to convey the same meaning.

4. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""My adversaries have nothing, how have I been your adversaries?""
	* Reference translation: ""I don't have any enmity with you, how did I become your enemy?""

The machine translation uses the word ""adversaries"" instead of ""enemy"" in the reference translation. This is another example of the software not understanding the nuances of the language.

5. Cultural context:
	* Machine translation: ""My adversaries have nothing, how have I been your adversaries?""
	* Reference translation: ""I don't have any enmity with you, how did I become your enemy?""

The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the original Nepali sentence. The phrase ""shatru"" is a common term used in Nepali to refer to an enemy or adversary, but it may not be immediately understandable to non-Nepali speakers.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation changes the wording, structure, and cultural context of the original sentence, which can result in a loss of meaning and clarity. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable translation of the Nepali sentence.

Machine Translation: ""Responsibility to be completed from political and economic directions,""

Reference Translation: ""To fulfill responsibilities from political and economic point of view.""

Here are the differences I found:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""political and economic directions"" while the reference translation uses ""political and economic point of view."" The reference translation uses a more idiomatic expression that is more commonly used in Nepali language.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present participle form of the verb ""to be"" (i.e., ""being"") in the source sentence, while the reference translation uses the infinitive form of the verb ""to fulfill"" (i.e., ""fulfilling"").
3. Fluency: The machine translation seems to struggle with the word order in the source sentence, resulting in a less fluent and less natural-sounding translation.
4. Cultural nuances: The reference translation takes into account cultural nuances in Nepali language, such as the use of the phrase ""point of view"" instead of ""directions.""

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate, natural-sounding, and culturally appropriate than the machine translation. However, it's worth noting that machine translation can still be useful for getting a general idea of the meaning of a text, and it can be a useful starting point for human translators to build upon.

	* Reference translation: ""The strong ones at the front hold the long wooden rows in place so that their beads are strong enough not to break, while the weak and old ones are placed back.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""holds"" three times in a row, which is repetitive and makes the sentence sound awkward. The reference translation uses a more varied sentence structure, with different verb forms and word order.
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""बलियो"" (strong) is used multiple times in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""strong ones"" to refer to the people holding the rods.
	* Reference translation: ""बलिया"" (strong) is used in the reference translation to refer to the people holding the rods, while ""बलियो"" (strong) is used to describe the rods themselves.
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""बलियो"" (strong) too many times, which can make the translation sound repetitive and less natural. The reference translation uses more varied vocabulary to convey the same meaning.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""लहरैसंग"" (long wooden rod) is not an idiomatic expression in Nepali, and the machine translation does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: ""लहरैसंग"" (long wooden rod) is an idiomatic expression in Nepali, and the reference translation uses it to convey the idea of a long, sturdy rod that can hold things in place.
	* Difference: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""लहरैसंग"" (long wooden rod), which can make the translation sound less natural and less accurate.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not include any cultural references, while the reference translation includes a cultural reference to the beads used in traditional Nepali music.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation includes a cultural reference to the beads used in traditional Nepali music, which is not present in the machine translation.
	* Difference: The machine translation does not include any cultural references, which can make the translation sound less authentic and less relevant to the Nepali culture.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have significant differences in terms of grammar, vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. The reference translation is more natural and accurate, while the machine translation sounds repetitive and less authentic.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""It is assumed that the fruit is obtained by acquiring the category acquired in one of the prawns."" - The sentence structure is awkward and the use of ""assumed"" is incorrect. It should be ""It is believed that the fruit is obtained by acquiring the category in one of the prawns.""
	* Reference translation: ""It is believed that he gets the fruits of donating crores of gold coins in one time."" - The sentence structure is better in the reference translation, and the use of ""believed"" is more appropriate.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: "" category acquired"" - The term ""category"" is not commonly used in Nepali, and ""acquired"" is not the correct word to use in this context. It should be ""crores of gold coins"" or ""gold coins"".
	* Reference translation: ""crores of gold coins"" - The reference translation uses the correct term for the amount of gold coins.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""obtained by acquiring the category"" - The phrase ""obtained by"" is not commonly used in Nepali, and the use of ""acquiring"" is not appropriate in this context. It should be ""by donating"" or ""by giving"".
	* Reference translation: ""gets the fruits"" - The reference translation uses a more common and idiomatic expression in Nepali.
4. Cultural context:
	* Machine translation: ""prawns"" - The term ""prawns"" is not commonly used in Nepali to refer to a large amount of money. It should be ""crores of gold coins"" or ""gold coins"".
	* Reference translation: ""crores of gold coins"" - The reference translation uses the correct term for the amount of gold coins.

Overall, the machine translation is not accurate in terms of grammar, vocabulary, idioms, and cultural context. The reference translation is more idiomatic and culturally appropriate. Therefore, I would give a lower quality score to the machine translation.

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation uses the phrase ""it will be read"" instead of ""Management, Commerce, Science and Medicine are taught"" in the reference translation.
* The verb tense is different in the machine translation, with the future tense used instead of the present tense in the reference translation.

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation uses the present tense to indicate that the subjects are currently being taught, whereas the machine translation uses the future tense to indicate that the subjects will be read in the future.
* The word order is different in the two translations, with the reference translation placing the subjects in a more logical order (Management, Commerce, Science, and Medicine) compared to the machine translation (Management, Commerce, Science and Medicine).

Overall, the machine translation is less accurate and clear compared to the reference translation. The use of the future tense in the machine translation makes it seem less relevant and out of place, especially since the context is a university curriculum. Additionally, the word order in the machine translation is not as logical as the reference translation, which could make it more difficult for readers to understand the intended meaning.

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating compared to the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate, clear, and logical, making it a better representation of the original Nepali text.

1. Word order: The machine translation keeps the original word order of the Nepali sentence, while the reference translation rearranges the words to better convey the meaning in English. For example, in the machine translation, ""2007 East and w. 2018 Summit"" is the original word order, while in the reference translation, ""Dolakha, formerly the administrative unit of Goshwara No. 2 before 2007 and until 2018 B.S."" rearranges the words to make it clearer that ""Dolakha"" is the name of the administrative unit.
2. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses more literal phrasing, while the reference translation uses more idiomatic phrasing to convey the meaning in English. For example, in the machine translation, ""also referred to as the east 2 Nmber Goshawks administrative unit"" is a literal translation of the Nepali phrase, while in the reference translation, ""formerly the administrative unit of Goshwara No. 2 before 2007 and until 2018 B.S."" uses more idiomatic phrasing to convey the same meaning.
3. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses more generic vocabulary, while the reference translation uses more specific vocabulary to convey the meaning in English. For example, in the machine translation, ""east 2 Nmber Goshawks"" is a more generic term, while in the reference translation, ""Goshwara No. 2"" is a more specific term that accurately conveys the meaning of the Nepali phrase.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses more basic grammar structures, while the reference translation uses more complex grammar structures to convey the meaning in English. For example, in the machine translation, ""2007 East and w. 2018 Summit"" uses simple verb forms, while in the reference translation, ""Dolakha, formerly the administrative unit of Goshwara No. 2 before 2007 and until 2018 B.S."" uses more complex verb forms to convey the meaning.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation, as it better conveys the meaning of the original Nepali sentence in English. The reference translation uses more specific vocabulary, rearranges the words to better convey the meaning, and uses more complex grammar structures to convey the meaning in English. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses more generic vocabulary, keeps the original word order, and uses more basic grammar structures, which results in a less accurate translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""churches"" instead of ""church"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense (""made laws"") while the reference translation uses the present tense (""made a law""). This difference in tense is due to the fact that the reference translation is a more recent translation, and it reflects the current state of affairs more accurately.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence slightly, placing ""Spain"" before ""made laws"" instead of after it. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the flow of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""strong criticism"" instead of the more common ""criticism"" in the reference translation. This is an idiomatic expression that is more commonly used in English, and it may not be immediately understandable to all readers.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation uses the term ""Roman Catholic Church"" instead of ""Roman Catholic Church in Spain"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the accuracy of the translation, especially for readers who are not familiar with the cultural context.
6. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""made"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""has made"" in the present perfect tense. This difference in verb tense is due to the fact that the reference translation is a more recent translation, and it reflects the current state of affairs more accurately.
7. Fluency: The machine translation is less fluent than the reference translation, with more awkward phrasing and word choices. This can affect the overall readability and clarity of the translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""considered"" twice in the same sentence, which is unnecessary and repetitive. The reference translation uses the word ""pilgrimages"" once and ""travels"" once, which is more concise and clear.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense in the second sentence. It should be ""his travels"" instead of ""her journeys"" to match the subject of the sentence.
3. Sentence structure: The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a compound sentence structure with a subordinate clause. The reference translation also uses a more complex sentence structure to convey the idea more clearly.
4. Word order: The machine translation puts the adjectives ""Ayodhya, Mathura, Pampapuri, Kaushambi, Sarnath"" before the nouns they modify, while the reference translation puts them after the nouns. This is a common difference in Nepali-English translation, as Nepali tends to put adjectives before nouns, while English tends to put them after.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""from this sentiment"" to convey the idea of the travels being considered as pilgrimage places.
6. Cultural context: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the sentence, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""from this sentiment"" to convey the idea that the travels are considered as pilgrimage places because of the cultural significance of the places.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. It uses more complex sentence structures, correct verb tenses, and cultural context to convey the idea more clearly. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses simpler sentence structures and word choice that may not be as clear or accurate.

Machine Translation:

* ""At that time there was a questionable role of motiram in the reformist view of the cedar.""

Reference Translation:

* ""At that time, Motiram had tremendous role in the reformist perspective of Dev Shumsher.""

Differences:

1. Use of ""questionable"" vs. ""tremendous"" - The machine translation uses the word ""questionable"" to describe Motiram's role, while the reference translation uses ""tremendous"". The choice of word depends on the context and the intended meaning. ""Questionable"" implies a sense of doubt or uncertainty, while ""tremendous"" conveys a sense of greatness or magnitude.
2. Use of ""reformist view"" vs. ""reformist perspective"" - The machine translation uses ""reformist view"" to describe Dev Shumsher's perspective, while the reference translation uses ""reformist perspective"". The difference lies in the level of detail and specificity. ""View"" is a more general term that refers to a broad outlook or perspective, while ""perspective"" implies a more nuanced and detailed understanding.
3. Use of ""motiram"" vs. ""Motiram"" - The machine translation uses the word ""motiram"" in the singular form, while the reference translation uses the name ""Motiram"" in the singular form. The difference is in the level of formality and personalization. ""Motiram"" is a more formal and impersonal term, while ""motiram"" is more informal and personal.
4. Use of ""Dev Shumsher"" vs. ""Dev Shumsher's"" - The machine translation uses ""Dev Shumsher"" in the singular form, while the reference translation uses ""Dev Shumsher's"". The difference is in the level of possession and personalization. ""Dev Shumsher"" is a more formal and impersonal term, while ""Dev Shumsher's"" is more informal and personal.

Overall, the reference translation is more detailed and nuanced in its language, while the machine translation is more concise and straightforward. The reference translation also uses more formal and personalized language, while the machine translation uses more informal and impersonal language.

Machine Translation (MT): He lived as a Samanya in the gatekapuri.

Reference Translation (RT): He lived a household life in Dwarkapuri like a normal person.

1. Grammar:
	* MT: The sentence structure in the MT is incorrect. It should be ""He lived as a Samanya in Dwarkapuri"" instead of ""He lived as a Samanya in the gatekapuri.""
	* RT: The sentence structure in the RT is correct.
2. Vocabulary:
	* MT: The word ""Samanya"" is not the correct term for a household life. The correct term is ""grihastashram.""
	* RT: The word ""grihastashram"" is used correctly in the RT.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* MT: The phrase ""gatekapuri"" is not a commonly used term in Nepali. The correct term is ""Dwarkapuri.""
	* RT: The phrase ""Dwarkapuri"" is used correctly in the RT.
4. Cultural references:
	* MT: The term ""Samanya"" is not a culturally appropriate term for a household life in Nepal. In Nepali culture, a household life is typically referred to as ""grihastashram.""
	* RT: The term ""grihastashram"" is used correctly in the RT, which reflects a better understanding of Nepali culture.
5. Fluency:
	* MT: The MT translation sounds awkward and unnatural, with an incorrect sentence structure and culturally inappropriate terminology.
	* RT: The RT translation sounds more natural and fluent, with a correct sentence structure and culturally appropriate terminology.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation uses culturally appropriate terminology, correct sentence structure, and accurate vocabulary, making it a more reliable and natural-sounding translation.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Government of Nepal Praja Party, a parliamentary constituency under the leadership of the king""
	* Reference translation: ""Constitution of consultant and government of Nepal Praja Party in leadership of the King""

The machine translation uses the word ""under"" to indicate the relationship between the government and the king, while the reference translation uses ""in leadership of the King"" to convey the same idea. The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as ""under"" implies a subordinate relationship, which may not be the intended meaning in this context.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""राजाको"" (raja ko)
	* Reference translation: ""Constitution of consultant and government of Nepal Praja Party""

The machine translation uses the word ""king"" in the source text, while the reference translation uses ""Constitution of consultant and government of Nepal Praja Party"". This is a significant difference, as the source text is actually referring to the Constitution of Nepal, not the king.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""परामर्शदात्री र""
	* Reference translation: ""in leadership of the King""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""परामर्शदात्री र"" (paramarshadātī ra), which is a Nepali idiom that means ""under the leadership of"". The reference translation uses the more common English phrase ""in leadership of the King"".

4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Government of Nepal Praja Party, a parliamentary constituency under the leadership of the king""
	* Reference translation: ""Constitution of consultant and government of Nepal Praja Party in leadership of the King""

The machine translation and the reference translation have different sentence structures. The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure, with two clauses connected by ""under"", while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a single clause.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the meaning of the source text more closely and uses more appropriate language for a native English speaker. The machine translation, on the other hand, makes some significant errors in grammar, word choice, and idiomatic expressions.

Machine Translation:

* ""The Utah Queen sets up a gate to welcome Daisy"" - This sentence is grammatically correct, but it doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. ""Utah"" is a place name, not a person or entity that can set up a gate. Additionally, ""Daisy"" is not a common name in Nepali culture, so it's unlikely that the queen would welcome someone with that name.
* ""knowing that the king's transport is to be"" - This sentence is also grammatically correct, but it's unclear what ""transport"" means in this context. In Nepali culture, ""transport"" typically refers to a vehicle or mode of transportation, so it's unlikely that the queen would be concerned about the king's transport.

Reference Translation:

* ""Meanwhile , the queen upon hearing about the king 's arrival stood her maids to welcome at the door"" - This sentence is grammatically correct and makes more sense in the context of the story.

Machine Translation: ""And he brought all the brazen men into the benefit of the girl.""

* The machine translation uses the word ""benefit"" instead of the correct word ""foot"" in the reference translation.
* The word ""brazen"" is not a commonly used word in Nepali, and it is not clear what it means in this context. In the reference translation, the word ""Braj"" is used, which is a region in India where Lord Krishna is said to have lived.

Reference Translation: ""Krishna took all the people of Braj to the foot of Gobardhan Giri.""

* The reference translation uses the correct word ""foot"" instead of ""benefit"" in the machine translation.
* The word ""Gobardhan Giri"" is the correct spelling for the mountain mentioned in the sentence, whereas the machine translation uses ""Girie"" instead.

Overall, the machine translation is not accurate in this case, as it uses uncommon words and makes a mistake in the spelling of the mountain. The reference translation is more accurate and uses more appropriate language for a Nepali-English translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""heavily involved"" instead of ""go to heaven"" in the reference translation. This suggests that the machine translation may not have fully captured the nuance of the original Nepali sentence.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""I will be"") in the second sentence, while the reference translation uses the future tense (""I will go""). This may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately convey the time frame of the action described in the original sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""Ashwin Krishnapaksha 's Indira Ekadashi"" in the reference translation. This suggests that the machine translation may not be able to recognize and translate certain cultural or idiomatic expressions in the source text.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the original sentence, placing ""If you can do"" at the beginning of the sentence instead of ""If you can make"". This may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately preserve the word order of the original sentence.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation ""If you can do to me the Indira Academy of mercy"" is not a grammatically correct sentence in Nepali. The correct sentence would be ""If you can make me do the Indira Academy of mercy"". This suggests that the machine translation may not be able to accurately translate the sentence into English.

Overall, the machine translation does not seem to be able to capture the nuances of the original Nepali sentence, and may not be able to accurately convey the meaning of the sentence in English. The reference translation, on the other hand, appears to be more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""tanab"" to describe the position between the shield, while the reference translation uses ""tense situation."" The word ""tanab"" is not a commonly used term in English, and it may not be immediately clear to English speakers what it means. In contrast, ""tense situation"" is a more common and natural way to describe a tense or difficult situation.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""grabbed"" in the past tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""defeated."" The machine translation also uses the phrase ""the shield's enemy"" to refer to Kane, while the reference translation uses ""Kane."" These differences in grammar and word choice can affect the overall clarity and naturalness of the translation.
3. Names: The machine translation uses the name ""Ken"" to refer to Kane, while the reference translation uses ""Kane."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the accuracy and consistency of the translation.
4. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense throughout, while the reference translation uses the past tense in some places and the present tense in others. For example, the machine translation says ""The Shield had lost to ken and racelmenia 30,"" while the reference translation says ""The Shield defeated Kane and The New Age Out."" This difference in tense can affect the overall flow and coherence of the translation.
5. Word order: The machine translation and the reference translation have different word orders in some places. For example, the machine translation says ""The Shield's enemy was with Ken and racelmenia 30,"" while the reference translation says ""Shield 's feudal was with Kane , and."" These differences in word order can affect the clarity and naturalness of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word choice, grammar, names, tense, and word order. While the machine translation may be able to generate text quickly and efficiently, it may not always produce the most accurate or natural-sounding translation. Therefore, it's important to carefully evaluate the quality of machine translations and consider using reference translations as a basis for checking and improving the accuracy of the translation.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""climb"" (रङ्गकर्मी)
	* Reference translation: ""play"" (नाट्य)

The machine translation uses the word ""climb"" to translate ""रङ्गकर्मी"", which is not a common term in Nepali. The reference translation uses the more appropriate term ""play"", which is a well-known term in Nepali for a dramatic performance.

4. Cultural references:

* The word ""भगवान्"" (Bhagavan) is translated as ""goddess"" instead of ""भगवन्"" (Bhagavan) which is the correct Nepali term for ""Lord"".
* The sentence structure is also different, the machine translation puts the name of the person being addressed first, while in the reference translation, the name of the person inquiring is first.

Reference Translation:

* The word ""धर्मराज"" (Dharmaraj) is translated correctly as ""Dharmaraj"" which is the correct Nepali term.
* The word ""Yudhisthir"" is translated correctly as ""Yudhishthira"" which is the correct Nepali spelling.
* The word ""भगवन्"" (Bhagavan) is translated correctly as ""Lord"" which is the correct Nepali term.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""holy"" to describe the heart, while the reference translation uses ""pure"". The word ""holy"" conveys a sense of sacredness or divinity, while ""pure"" implies a lack of impurities or contamination. The reference translation's choice of word better captures the nuance of the original Nepali phrase, which uses the word ""सुरुप्य"" (surupyam), which means ""pure"" or ""unadulterated"".
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""may only recognize"" instead of the present participle ""is able to recognize"" used in the reference translation. The present participle ""is able to"" better conveys the ongoing nature of the ability to recognize or understand the self.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""spirituality"" which is a bit awkward in this context, as the original Nepali phrase uses a more common idiomatic expression ""आत्मत्व"" (atmatatva), which means ""the self"" or ""one's own self"". The reference translation captures this idiomatic expression more accurately.
4. Cultural context: The machine translation uses the word ""holy"" which may not be immediately familiar to all readers, especially those from non-religious or non-Christian backgrounds. The reference translation avoids using any religious language and instead uses a more general term ""self"" which is more inclusive.
5. Fluency: The machine translation seems to struggle with the sentence structure and word order, which results in a less fluent and less natural-sounding translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, maintains a more consistent and natural-sounding sentence structure.

Overall, while the machine translation is not terrible, it falls short in capturing the nuances of the original Nepali phrase. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and natural-sounding translation that better conveys the intended meaning.

Machine Translation:

* ""And it came to pass on a day, that the king was so loaned, that the loan came to the king's house.""

Reference Translation:

* ""One day the king was so anxious, and the sage Gautam came to the king wandering around.""

Step 1: Grammar and Syntax

* Machine Translation: The sentence structure in the machine translation is correct, with a subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern.
* Reference Translation: The sentence structure in the reference translation is also correct, with a SVO pattern.

Step 2: Vocabulary and Lexicon

* Machine Translation: The machine translation uses some proper nouns and technical terms, such as ""loan"" and ""king's house,"" which are not found in the reference translation.
* Reference Translation: The reference translation uses more descriptive and idiomatic phrases, such as ""anxious"" and ""wandering around,"" which are not found in the machine translation.

Step 3: Cultural and Contextual Appropriateness

* Machine Translation: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural and contextual nuances of the original sentence. For example, the phrase "" loan came to the king's house"" may not be culturally appropriate in Nepali, as it does not convey the idea of the sage Gautam coming to the king's house.
* Reference Translation: The reference translation captures the cultural and contextual nuances of the original sentence, as it uses the phrase ""wandered around"" to convey the idea of the sage Gautam coming to the king's house.

Step 4: Fluency and Naturalness

* Machine Translation: The machine translation does not flow as naturally as the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""the loan came to the king's house"" sounds more formal and less natural than ""wandered around.""
* Reference Translation: The reference translation flows more naturally and has a more fluid sentence structure than the machine translation.

Based on these evaluations, it is clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the cultural and contextual nuances of the original sentence more accurately, uses more descriptive and idiomatic phrases, and flows more naturally than the machine translation.

4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""is"" in the sentence ""Bhuvanpokhari which is part of the overseas magistrate community"" which is incorrect. The correct verb to use would be ""comprises"".
5. Punctuation: The machine translation lacks proper punctuation, which can make the sentence difficult to read and understand.
6. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, making it difficult to understand the meaning. For example, in the machine translation, ""Bhuvanpokhari which is part of the overseas magistrate community"" is changed to ""Bhuvanpokhari, which is part of the overseas magistrate community"".
7. Accuracy: The machine translation is not accurate in its translation of the Nepali words. For example, ""kumalgarh"" is not a recognized caste in Nepal, and ""chalukyas"" is not a caste found in Nepal.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""attempts"" instead of ""attempt"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. In the reference translation, ""attempt"" is used as a singular noun, indicating that there was only one attempt to assassinate the person. In contrast, the machine translation uses ""attempts"" as a plural noun, suggesting that there were multiple attempts.
2. Tense consistency: The machine translation uses the past tense ""were"" to indicate the three unsuccessful attempts, while the reference translation uses the present tense ""was"" to indicate the single attempt in the summer of 1934. This difference in tense can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the attempts occurred at different times.
3. Word order: The machine translation places the word ""there"" at the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation places it after the verb ""were"". This difference in word order can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as it can change the emphasis of the sentence.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""to take"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""to make"" in the past tense. This difference in verb tense can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as it can change the time frame of the action.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""to take his life"". This difference in language use can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as idiomatic expressions can convey different meanings than literal translations.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, tense consistency, word order, grammar, and idiomatic expressions.

	* Reference translation: ""within seven days of registration of application for appointment of Liquidator"" (present perfect tense)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the present tense, while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense. The present perfect tense is more appropriate in this context, as it emphasizes that the registration process has already been completed.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Registrar of the department appointments"" (incorrect word order)
	* Reference translation: ""Registrar of the Department appointments"" (correct word order)
	* Difference: The machine translation puts the word ""appointments"" after the noun ""Registrar,"" while the reference translation places it before the noun. This is a minor error, but it can affect the clarity of the sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""Environmental Polluters"" instead of the reference translation's ""Environmental pollutants"". This is a minor difference, but it does affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly.
2. Tense: The machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation is in the present perfect tense. This is a more subtle difference, but it can affect the way the sentence is interpreted.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence slightly, placing ""there is"" at the beginning of the sentence instead of after ""In"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the flow of the sentence.
4. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a more complex phrase structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""bad air quality"" is separated into two separate phrases, while in the reference translation, it is combined into a single phrase.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""both indoors and outdoors"" used in the reference translation. Instead, it uses the more literal translation ""both locations inside and outside of the house"".
6. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""is"" instead of ""includes"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
7. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses the term ""Environmental Polluters"" instead of ""environmental pollutants"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, tense, word order, phrase structure, idiomatic expressions, grammar, and vocabulary. While some of these differences are minor, they can affect the overall meaning and accuracy of the translation. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the quality of the translation and make any necessary corrections to ensure that it is accurate and effective.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""campuses"" instead of ""associated campuses"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Number agreement: The machine translation uses the singular form ""campus"" throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the plural form ""campuses"". This is a more significant difference, as it affects the number of entities being referred to.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense verb form ""has"" to indicate possession, while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense verb form ""have"". This is a minor difference in grammar, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
4. Word order: The machine translation puts the number of campuses before the type of campuses, while the reference translation puts the type of campuses first and then the number. This is a minor difference in word order, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""associated campuses"". This is a significant difference, as idiomatic expressions can affect the overall meaning and fluency of the translation.

Based on these differences, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as moderate, with some minor errors in word choice, number agreement, grammar, word order, and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation, on the other hand, is of high quality, with accurate word choice, number agreement, grammar, word order, and idiomatic expressions.

Overall, while the machine translation is not perfect, it can still be useful for basic communication purposes. However, for more formal or professional contexts, it's important to use a high-quality reference translation to ensure accuracy and fluency.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""As it is easy to show the way the goal is fixed"" - The sentence structure is incorrect, and ""it"" should be ""the"" before ""goal"".
	* Reference translation: ""The easier it is to show the way to those who have a definite goal"" - The sentence structure is correct, and ""it"" is used correctly before ""goal"".
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""लक्ष्य निश्चित भएकालाई"" - The word ""लक्ष्य"" (goal) is not the correct translation of ""target"" in this context.
	* Reference translation: ""the problem"" - The word ""problem"" is not the correct translation of ""समस्या"" (samsya) in this context.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""it is difficult to get rid of the problem"" - The idiomatic expression ""get rid of"" is not commonly used in Nepali, and the translation is not natural.
	* Reference translation: ""those who run into problems"" - The idiomatic expression ""run into"" is not commonly used in Nepali, and the translation is not natural.
4. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: The phrase ""लक्ष्य निश्चित भएकालाई"" is a Nepali idiom that means ""those who have a definite goal"". The machine translation does not capture this cultural nuance.
	* Reference translation: The phrase ""those who run into problems"" is not a direct translation of the Nepali idiom, but it conveys the idea that the problem is encountered by someone who is trying to achieve a goal.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of grammar, word choice, idiomatic expressions, and cultural nuances. The reference translation is more natural and idiomatic in Nepali, and it better captures the cultural nuances of the original sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""black"" to describe the color, while the reference translation uses the word ""squandering"" to describe the act of misusing money. This difference in word choice may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""black"" has a different connotation than ""squandering.""
2. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""filled with corruption"" which is not a direct translation of the Nepali phrase ""भ्रष्टचारीको विल्ला भिराइदिन्थे"" in the reference translation. The idiomatic expression used in the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding in Nepali.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""let"" in the imperative mood, which is not present in the reference translation. The reference translation uses the verb ""would be labelled"" in the indicative mood, which is more appropriate for a statement of fact.
4. Tone: The machine translation has a more harsh and critical tone, while the reference translation has a more neutral tone. The reference translation is more appropriate for a formal or academic setting, while the machine translation may be more suitable for a casual or informal context.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more appropriate language and grammar, and conveys the intended meaning more clearly.

Machine Translation:

* ""Raja Khan started after jangbhadra won and applied ruling.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Rana dynasty started after Janga Bahadur won and implemented Rana regime.""

Differences:

1. Names: In the machine translation, the name ""Raja Khan"" is used instead of ""Rana dynasty"". This is a significant difference as ""Raja Khan"" is not a recognized historical figure in Nepal, whereas ""Rana dynasty"" is a well-known term that refers to a specific ruling family in Nepalese history.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""started"" to indicate the beginning of Raja Khan's rule, whereas the reference translation uses the past participle ""implemented"" to indicate the beginning of the Rana regime. This difference in verb tense may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does indicate a difference in the way the translator chose to convey the information.
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""jangbhadra"" instead of ""Janga Bahadur"". While both words are acceptable Nepali spellings for the same name, the reference translation uses the more commonly used spelling ""Janga Bahadur"".
4. Phrasing: The machine translation uses the phrase ""after jangbhadra won"" instead of ""after Janga Bahadur won"". This difference in phrasing may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does indicate a difference in the way the translator chose to convey the information.

Overall, the machine translation contains several errors that can affect the accuracy and readability of the translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and uses more commonly used terminology, which makes it a better choice for a reliable translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""jumps"" instead of ""use"" in the reference translation. This is a common error in machine translation, as it often struggles to accurately translate idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are"") to translate the Nepali verb ""आयोजना"" (ayojana), which is in the imperfective aspect in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses the present perfect tense (""have used"") to convey the same meaning.
3. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses the word ""Rockies"" to translate the Nepali word ""रक्सी"" (raksi), which is a type of alcoholic beverage in Nepal. This is a significant error, as ""Rockies"" is a geographical term that refers to a mountain range in North America, and is not a commonly used term in Nepal.
4. Sentence structure: The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure than the reference translation, which is more complex and conveys more information. The reference translation includes more details about the occasions on which the alcohol is used, while the machine translation is more general and doesn't provide as much context.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""During the January uprising, pasang was heard by himself many times during his death."" (Incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""During the People's War, Pasang had heard the news of his own death many times."" (Correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense in the second sentence, which is ""was heard"" instead of ""had heard."" The correct verb tense should be ""had heard"" to match the past tense of the sentence.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""पासाङले"" (pāsāngale) (Incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Pasang"" (Correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong word for ""Pasang,"" which is the name of a person in the reference translation. The correct word should be ""Pasang"" instead of ""पासाङले.""

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""धेरैपटक"" (dherāpatk) (Incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""many times"" (Correct)

The machine translation uses a Nepali idiomatic expression ""धेरैपटक"" which means ""many times"" but it is not a common or natural way to express this idea in English. The reference translation uses the more common and natural English phrase ""many times"" to convey the same meaning.

4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""आफ्नो मृत्युको खबर आफैँले सुन्नुभएको थिyo."" (Incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""During the People's War, Pasang had heard the news of his own death many times."" (Correct)

The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the original Nepali sentence, which is a simple sentence, to a complex one. The reference translation keeps the original sentence structure, which is simpler and more natural in English.

Based on these differences, I would give the reference translation a higher quality score than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, natural, and follows the correct grammar and word choice rules.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""redeemed"" which means ""to make amends for something"" or ""to pay back something"". However, the reference translation uses the word ""stained"" which means ""to make something dirty or impure by contact with something unpleasant or harmful"".
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense ""are killed"" while the reference translation uses the past tense ""were killed"". This difference in tense may not have a significant impact on the overall meaning of the sentence, but it could affect the way the sentence is interpreted in different contexts.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""redeemed"" in the active voice, while the reference translation uses the verb ""stained"" in the passive voice. The active voice emphasizes the agency of the subject, while the passive voice emphasizes the object of the action.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""everything that we suffer"" which is not found in the reference translation. The reference translation uses the phrase ""every objects we possess"" which is a more literal translation of the Nepali sentence.
5. Cultural nuances: The machine translation may not capture the cultural nuances of the Nepali sentence, as the phrase ""रक्तरञ्जित हुनेछ"" (raktranjit hunnech) is a metaphorical expression that conveys the idea of paying back or making amends for something with one's own blood. This cultural nuance is not fully conveyed in the machine translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, tense, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and cultural nuances. While the machine translation may be adequate for simple translations, it may not capture the nuances and cultural context of more complex sentences like this one. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation of the Nepali sentence.

	* Machine translation: ""In 2012, 10 and 11 were elected to the sixth Congress of the Nepali Congress, making goldsmiths chair in wirganj.""
	* Reference translation: ""The 6th General Convention of the Nepali Congress was held in Birgunj on 10 and 11 Magh 2012 with Suvarna Shumsher as the chairman.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense, using ""were elected"" instead of ""was held.""
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""goldsmiths chair""
	* Reference translation: ""6th General Convention""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a non-standard term for a chair, while the reference translation uses a more standard and formal term for the event.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""making goldsmiths chair in wirganj""
	* Reference translation: ""with Suvarna Shumsher as the chairman""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a non-standard idiomatic expression, while the reference translation uses a more standard and idiomatic expression.
4. Names and titles:
	* Machine translation: ""Suvarna Shumsher""
	* Reference translation: ""Suvarna Shumsher as the chairman""
	* Difference: The machine translation does not use the title ""chairman"" for Suvarna Shumsher, while the reference translation does.
5. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""In 2012, 10 and 11 were elected to the sixth Congress of the Nepali Congress, making goldsmiths chair in wirganj.""
	* Reference translation: ""The 6th General Convention of the Nepali Congress was held in Birgunj on 10 and 11 Magh 2012 with Suvarna Shumsher as the chairman.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a different sentence structure, with a more complex sentence structure in the machine translation.

Overall, the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation, with several errors in grammar, word choice, idiomatic expressions, names and titles, and sentence structure. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic, and better conveys the meaning of the original Nepali text.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

Machine Translation:

* ""Both of these changes can result in an increase in pulmonary rhythms"" - The machine translation uses the term ""pulmonary rhythms"" instead of ""pulmonary valves"" in the reference translation.
* ""which can generate a core pulmonel"" - The machine translation adds the word ""core"" before ""pulmonel"" which is not present in the reference translation.

Reference Translation:

* ""These two changes results in increased blood pressure in pulmunary valves"" - The reference translation uses the correct term ""pulmonary valves"" instead of ""pulmonary rhythms"" as used in the machine translation.
* ""which creates core pulmonale"" - The reference translation adds the word ""core"" before ""pulmonale"" which is not present in the machine translation.

Comparison:

Both the machine translation and the reference translation are attempting to convey the same meaning, but there are some differences in the way they do it. The machine translation uses more technical language, such as ""pulmonary rhythms"" instead of ""pulmonary valves"", which may not be immediately familiar to all readers. Additionally, the machine translation adds the word ""core"" before ""pulmonel"" which is not present in the reference translation.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and clear in its language, as it uses more common and familiar terms, such as ""pulmonary valves"" instead of ""pulmonary rhythms"". The machine translation, on the other hand, uses more technical language and adds an extra word, ""core"", which is not necessary in this context.

I hope this helps you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Let me know if you have any further questions!

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation:

* ""Upon being told that the roughs are astonished, but not a purpose.""

Reference Translation:

* ""It is stated above that Khas are Ayras but not Vedic Aryas.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""roughs"" instead of ""Khas"".
2. Meaning: The machine translation seems to convey a different meaning than the reference translation. While the machine translation suggests that the Khas people are astonished but not for a purpose, the reference translation clearly states that Khas are Ayras but not Vedic Aryas.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""are"" instead of the past tense ""were"" in the reference translation.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not seem to capture the idiomatic expression ""खसहरू आर्य हुन्"" (Khas are Ayras) in the reference translation.
5. Cultural context: The machine translation may not fully capture the cultural context of the sentence, as the term ""Khas"" refers to a specific ethnic group in Nepal, and the reference translation uses the term ""Ayras"" which is a term used in Nepal to refer to the Vedic Aryans.

Overall, the machine translation seems to have made several errors in word choice, meaning, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and cultural context, which can affect the overall quality of the translation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating compared to the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""basis of\tsamaic Justice""
	* Reference translation: ""basis of social justice""

The machine translation uses the term ""tsamaic Justice,"" which is not a commonly used term in Nepali. In Nepali, ""tsama"" means ""justice"" or ""fairness,"" so the phrase ""tsamaic Justice"" is not grammatically correct. The reference translation uses the more common term ""social justice,"" which is a more accurate representation of the original Nepali phrase.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""for economic cooperation on the basis of\tsamaic Justice""
	* Reference translation: ""for economic prosperity on the basis of social justice""

The machine translation uses the incorrect grammar structure in the second sentence. The phrase ""on the basis of"" should be in the correct form ""on the basis of,"" and ""cooperation"" should be ""prosperity.""

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""सामाजिक न्यायका"" (samaajik nyaya)
	* Reference translation: ""social justice""

The machine translation does not accurately translate the idiomatic expression ""samaajik nyaya,"" which means ""social justice"" in Nepali.

4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""आधारमा आर्थिक संवृद्धिका""
	* Reference translation: ""land reform and industrialization""

The machine translation changes the word order of the original Nepali phrase, which should be ""आधारमा आर्थिक संवृद्धिका"" (land reform and industrialization).

5. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: ""for economic cooperation on the basis of\tsamaic Justice""
	* Reference translation: ""for economic prosperity on the basis of social justice""

The machine translation does not capture the tone and style of the original Nepali phrase, which is more formal and serious. The reference translation better conveys the tone and style of the original phrase.

Overall, the machine translation is not accurate and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Nepali phrase and better conveys the intended meaning.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""In May 2017 The Miz and his wife Mary were increased reinforcements between them after they came to ruin.""
	* Reference translation: ""In May 2017 , when The Miz and his wife Marysecame too came to RAW , the tension between them had increased again .""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense in the second sentence, changing ""came"" to ""came too.""
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""reinforcements""
	* Reference translation: ""tension""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the wrong word to translate ""पत्नी"" (patni), which means ""wife"" in Nepali.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""after they came to ruin""
	* Reference translation: ""when The Miz and his wife Marysecame too came to RAW""
	* Difference: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""came to ruin"" in Nepali, which is not a literal translation of ""आएपछि"" (aapechhi).
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""In May 2017 The Miz and his wife Mary were increased reinforcements between them after they came to ruin.""
	* Reference translation: ""In May 2017 , when The Miz and his wife Marysecame too came to RAW , the tension between them had increased again .""
	* Difference: The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the original Nepali sentence, making it more direct and straightforward.
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: ""In May 2017 The Miz and his wife Mary were increased reinforcements between them after they came to ruin.""
	* Reference translation: ""In May 2017 , when The Miz and his wife Marysecame too came to RAW , the tension between them had increased again .""
	* Difference: The reference translation flows better and is more fluent in English, while the machine translation sounds more stilted and unnatural.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation in this case. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence better, including the idiomatic expressions and the correct verb tense.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the machine translation and the reference translation for the given Nepali sentence.

Machine Translation:

* The sentence structure is mostly correct, but there are some minor errors in the verb conjugation.
* The word ""committed"" is not the best choice to translate ""खरिदबिक्री"" as it implies a more formal or legal sense, whereas the intended meaning is more related to financial transactions. A better choice would be ""spent"" or ""invested"".
* The phrase ""at one time"" is not necessary and can be omitted.

Reference Translation:

* The sentence structure is mostly correct, but there is a minor error in the verb conjugation of ""कमिसन"". It should be ""कमिसने"" instead of ""कमिसन"".
* The word choice for ""खरिदबिक्री"" is better than in the machine translation, as it accurately conveys the meaning of financial transactions.
* The phrase ""at once"" is correctly translated as ""एकै पटकमा"".

Comparison:

* Both translations have some minor errors in verb conjugation and word choice, but the reference translation is more accurate overall.
* The machine translation uses more formal language, which may not be suitable for all contexts.
* The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding, making it a better choice for most situations.

Conclusion:

Based on the evaluation, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. While both translations have some minor errors, the reference translation is more idiomatic and better conveys the intended meaning of the original Nepali sentence. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the primary translation for this sentence.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""In the current day"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed at the end.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is severed"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""has been expanded""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""severed"" instead of ""expanded"". This is a significant difference, as ""severed"" means ""cut off"" or ""divided"", while ""expanded"" means ""grew or increased in size"".
4. Punctuation: The machine translation lacks punctuation at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation includes a period. This can make the sentence harder to read and understand.
5. Grammar: The machine translation has a grammatical error in the form of a subject-verb agreement issue. The verb ""goes"" should agree with the subject ""expansion of patna town"" in number, but it is in the singular form. In the reference translation, the verb is in the plural form to match the subject.
6. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""mixed up with"" which is commonly used in Nepali to indicate a combination or blending of two things.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and grammatically correct, and it better conveys the intended meaning of the original Nepali sentence.

Machine Translation:

* The sentence structure is not as clear as the reference translation.

This can be confusing, as it is not clear who the ""this"" refers to. In the reference translation, the sentence is structured as ""COPD is more common in relatives who smoke than in people who are not related and who smoke.""
* The use of the word ""धुम्रपान"" (dhumrapaan) is not accurate. In the machine translation, the word ""धुम्रपान"" is translated as ""smoking,"" but in Nepali, ""धुम्रपान"" actually means ""smoke.""
* The word ""नाता"" (nata) is not translated correctly. In the machine translation, ""नाता"" is translated as ""natives,"" but in Nepali, ""नाता"" actually means ""relatives.""
* The phrase ""नलाग्ने धुप्रमान गर्ने"" is not translated correctly. In the machine translation, the phrase is translated as ""This smoking is more accurate to natives than people who do not smoke COPD's natives,"" but in Nepali, the phrase ""नलाग्ने धुप्रमान गर्ने"" actually means ""COPD is more common in relatives who smoke than in people who are not related and who smoke.""

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""little ones"" instead of ""small children"" in the reference translation. ""Little ones"" is a more informal and colloquial term, while ""small children"" is more formal and appropriate in formal writing or in situations where precision is important.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are"") in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the present continuous tense (""have to""). The present continuous tense is more appropriate in this context as it emphasizes the ongoing nature of spending time with the children.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""in the family"" at the end of the sentence, which is a common idiomatic expression in English. However, the reference translation does not use this phrase, which may make the sentence sound less natural to a native English speaker.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence slightly, placing ""days"" before ""of the young"" instead of after it. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and flow of the sentence.
5. Cultural nuances: The reference translation takes into account cultural nuances by using the phrase ""you have to spend time with the small children in the family."" This phrase is more appropriate in Nepali culture, where family is highly valued and spending time with children is considered an important responsibility. The machine translation does not capture this cultural context.

Overall, while the machine translation is grammatically correct, it lacks the nuance and cultural context that the reference translation provides. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation in this case.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""blend"" instead of ""mix"" to describe the action of combining sesame seeds and chaku. While ""blend"" can be used to describe the act of combining different ingredients, it doesn't quite convey the same meaning as ""mix"" in this context.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense verb form ""eat"" and ""share"" to describe the action of consuming the laddu, while the reference translation uses the past tense verb form ""ate"" and ""shared"". This difference in verb tense is due to the machine translation's inability to capture the nuances of Nepali grammar.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""chaku"" which is commonly used in Nepali to refer to a type of sesame seed mixture used to make laddu. The reference translation uses the phrase ""make laddu by mixing sesame seeds in Chaku"" which better conveys the meaning of the original Nepali sentence.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""they"" and ""eat"" come before ""laddu"", while in the reference translation, ""laddu"" comes before ""eat"". This difference in word order can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation doesn't capture the cultural significance of the act of making and sharing laddu during special occasions in Nepal.

2. Equivalence: The machine translation uses the term ""reliable equivalence"" in the reference translation, which is not a common term in legal language. The reference translation uses the term ""marital equality"" which is a more common and accurate term in this context.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure in the second sentence, with a subordinate clause ""in the law of nidarland"" which is not present in the reference translation.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""differentiating and reliable equivalence"" which is not a common idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more common phrase ""heterosexual and marital equality"".

Overall, the machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original Nepali sentence as accurately as the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and uses more common and accurate legal terminology. Therefore, I would give a lower rating to the machine translation in this case.

Machine Translation:

* The neighborhood is also known as the holiest style of bihar.

Reference Translation:

* The Bhojpuri-typed Holi of the neighborhood Bihar is also attractive.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""style"" instead of ""Bhojpuri-typed Holi"" in the reference translation.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is also known"") instead of the past tense (""was also attractive"") in the reference translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""Bhojpuri-typed Holi"" in the reference translation, which is a common way to refer to the Holi festival in Bihar.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation ""neighborhood"" is not entirely accurate as the original Nepali sentence uses the word ""छिमेकी"" which refers to a specific region in Bihar.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and accuracy. The reference translation provides a more nuanced and accurate translation of the original Nepali sentence.

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation uses the phrase ""major asteroid"" instead of ""major text"" in the reference translation.
* The machine translation uses the word ""after"" instead of ""only"" to indicate the relationship between the text and the Vedas.
* The machine translation translates ""हिन्दु धर्मको"" as ""Hinduism"" instead of ""Hindu dharma"".
* The machine translation uses the word ""also"" twice in the sentence, which makes it seem repetitive and less natural.

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation uses the phrase ""after the Vedas"" to indicate the relationship between the text and the Vedas, which is more accurate and clear than the machine translation.
* The reference translation translates ""हिन्दु धर्मको"" as ""Hindu dharma"", which is more accurate than the machine translation.
* The reference translation uses the word ""only"" to indicate that the text is the largest in the world, which is more accurate than the machine translation.

Overall, the machine translation is less accurate and natural-sounding than the reference translation. The machine translation uses less common phrases and words, and the sentence structure is less natural. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses more common phrases and words and has a more natural sentence structure. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further translation work.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""And it came to pass in that day""
	* Reference translation: ""In order to know that tyrannical king""

The machine translation uses more formal and literal wording, while the reference translation uses more idiomatic and natural language. The reference translation also adds context to the sentence by specifying the type of king being referred to.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""two things had to be considered""
	* Reference translation: ""two things had to be thought of""

The machine translation uses the present tense ""had to be considered,"" while the reference translation uses the past tense ""had to be thought of."" This difference in verb tense does not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence, but it does show a difference in the way the translator chose to convey the information.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""two things""
	* Reference translation: ""two things had to be considered""

The machine translation places the words ""two things"" at the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation places them after the verb ""had to be considered."" This difference in word order affects the emphasis and structure of the sentence, with the reference translation placing more emphasis on the idea of considering two things.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""tyrannical king""
	* Reference translation: ""tyrant king""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""tyrannical king,"" which is a more formal and technical term for a king who rules with absolute power. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic term ""tyrant king.""

5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""two things""
	* Reference translation: ""two things had to be considered""

The machine translation does not provide any cultural context for the sentence, while the reference translation adds the idea of considering two things in the context of a tyrannical king. This difference highlights the importance of cultural knowledge and understanding in translation.

Overall, the reference translation provides a more natural and idiomatic rendering of the sentence, while the machine translation is more formal and literal. The differences in word choice, grammar, word order, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references demonstrate the importance of careful translation and the need for cultural knowledge and understanding.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""After returning home from the conference, he played a lot of things together in the mansion."" - The verb tense is incorrect in the machine translation. It should be ""After returning home from the conference, he played many things together in the mansion.""
	* Reference translation: ""As soon as I returned home from the conference, many things started hovering in my mind at once."" - The verb tense is correct in the reference translation.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""After returning home from the conference, he played a lot of things together in the mansion."" - The phrase ""a lot of things"" is too vague and could be replaced with something more specific, such as ""many things"" or ""various things.""
	* Reference translation: ""As soon as I returned home from the conference, many things started hovering in my mind at once."" - The phrase ""many things started hovering in my mind at once"" is more descriptive and accurate than the machine translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""After returning home from the conference, he played a lot of things together in the mansion."" - The idiomatic expression ""hovering in my mind"" is not translated accurately in the machine translation. The correct idiomatic expression in this context is ""started to swirl in my mind.""
	* Reference translation: ""As soon as I returned home from the conference, many things started to swirl in my mind at once."" - The reference translation captures the idiomatic expression more accurately than the machine translation.
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""After returning home from the conference, he played a lot of things together in the mansion."" - The sentence structure is awkward and wordy in the machine translation. A more natural sentence structure in Nepali would be ""After returning home from the conference, he started playing many things together in the mansion.""
	* Reference translation: ""As soon as I returned home from the conference, many things started hovering in my mind at once."" - The sentence structure is more natural and concise in the reference translation.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence more effectively, including the idiomatic expressions and the sentence structure.

3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""purushinge"" instead of ""Pursinge"" in the reference translation.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""consists"" instead of the past tense ""consisted"" in the reference translation.
5. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order slightly, placing ""two meadows"" before ""two maroons"" and ""a purushinge dance"" at the end of the sentence. In the reference translation, the word order is different, with ""two Madale"" before ""two Maruni"" and ""Pursinge dance"" at the end of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation makes several errors in word choice, grammar, and word order, which results in a lower quality translation compared to the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""nobility"" to translate ""खयर"" (Khaira), which is not the most accurate translation. In Nepali, ""खयर"" refers to a specific constellation in the night sky, not a social class or rank. The reference translation uses the word ""Mrigashira"" which is the correct term for the constellation in Nepali.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""could live"" in the past tense, which is not the most natural way to translate the Nepali sentence. A more accurate translation would be ""can live"" or ""lives"".
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""सकारात्मक जीवन"" (sakaaraatmak jivan) which means a life filled with positive qualities. This expression is specific to Nepali and is not commonly used in English.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the Nepali sentence, which can make it harder to understand. In Nepali, the subject ""person"" comes before the verb, whereas in the machine translation, it comes after the verb.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation is not entirely accurate in its translation of the Nepali sentence. For example, the word ""worship"" is not the most appropriate translation for the Nepali word ""पूजा"" (poja), which means to honor or reverence something.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. It captures the nuances of the Nepali sentence better and is more faithful to the original meaning.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""disturbances"" instead of ""bad feelings"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""disturbances"" implies a more general and vague sense of disruption, whereas ""bad feelings"" is a more specific term that conveys a negative emotional state.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""was"" in the past tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""should be"" in the present tense. This difference in verb tense can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""was"" implies a completed action in the past, while ""should be"" implies a recommendation or expectation for the future.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""take place"" instead of ""offer"" in the reference translation. This is a difference in idiomatic expression, as ""take place"" implies a more formal or literal sense of action, whereas ""offer"" is a more common and idiomatic way of expressing the idea of giving something to someone or something.
4. Cultural references: The machine translation uses the term ""Nava Durga"" instead of ""Nava Durga temple"" in the reference translation. ""Nava Durga"" is a Sanskrit term that refers to the nine forms of the Hindu goddess Durga, while ""Nava Durga temple"" is a more specific term that refers to a temple dedicated to the worship of Nava Durga. This difference in terminology reflects the cultural context and nuances of the Nepali language.
5. Fluency: The machine translation seems to struggle with the sentence structure and word choice, resulting in a less fluent and less natural-sounding translation compared to the reference translation. This is a common challenge in machine translation, as the algorithms may not always be able to capture the nuances and complexities of language.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have significant differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, cultural references, and fluency. While the machine translation may be able to capture some of the basic meaning of the sentence, it falls short in terms of accuracy, nuance, and cultural sensitivity. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more reliable and accurate source for Nepali-English translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""place place"" (twice)
	* Reference translation: ""from place to place""
	
The machine translation uses the phrase ""place place"" twice, which is not grammatically correct. The reference translation uses the more idiomatic phrase ""from place to place"" to convey the same meaning.

2. Tense consistency:
	* Machine translation: ""according to the place place""
	* Reference translation: ""according to place to place""
	
The machine translation uses the present tense ""according to the place place"" while the reference translation uses the past tense ""according to place to place"". This inconsistency in tense can make the translation sound less natural.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""entry and permissions differ according to the place place""
	* Reference translation: ""entry permit and permit differ from place to place""
	
The machine translation reverses the order of the words in the sentence, which can make it sound less natural. The reference translation keeps the words in their original order, which is more idiomatic.

4. Phrase structure:
	* Machine translation: ""type and fees of entry and permissions differ according to the place place""
	* Reference translation: ""type and fee of entry permit and permit differ from place to place""
	
The machine translation uses a longer phrase structure than the reference translation, which can make the sentence sound less natural. The reference translation uses shorter phrases that are more commonly used in Nepali language.

5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""according to the place place""
	* Reference translation: ""according to place to place""
	
As mentioned earlier, the machine translation uses the phrase ""place place"" twice, which is not a common idiomatic expression in Nepali language. The reference translation uses the more idiomatic phrase ""according to place to place"".

Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation. The machine translation introduces new concepts and assumptions that are not present in the original Nepali sentence, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""He noted that they were not as broken as normal"" - The sentence structure is incorrect, and ""broken"" is not the correct word to use in this context. A more accurate translation would be ""He noted that they were not as bad as usual.""
	* Reference translation: ""He indicated that they were not as bad as normal"" - This sentence structure is correct, and ""bad"" is a more appropriate word to use in this context.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""filled with wind and dangerous in the air"" - The phrase ""filled with wind"" is not a common expression in Nepali, and ""dangerous in the air"" is not a clear or accurate translation of the original phrase. A more accurate translation would be ""filled with air"" or ""filled with wind.""
	* Reference translation: ""filled with air"" - This is a more accurate translation of the original phrase, as ""air"" is a more common and appropriate word to use in this context.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""khakar le bhareko"" - This phrase is not a common or accurate way to translate ""filled with air"" in Nepali. A more accurate translation would be ""filled with wind"" or ""filled with air.""
	* Reference translation: ""filled with sputum"" - This is a more accurate translation of the original phrase, as ""sputum"" is a more common and appropriate word to use in this context.
4. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: There is no mention of cultural nuances in the machine translation.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation acknowledges the cultural nuance of the original phrase by using the word ""sputum,"" which is a more appropriate term to use in this context.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and culturally appropriate than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more common and appropriate words and phrases, and acknowledges cultural nuances in a way that the machine translation does not.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""Devan Buddhist Raja"" are placed together, while in the reference translation, they are separated by a comma.
2. Punctuation: The machine translation lacks punctuation, while the reference translation has proper punctuation. This makes the reference translation easier to read and understand.
3. Accuracy of translation: The machine translation has made some errors in the translation of proper nouns. For example, ""Morang"" is misspelled as ""मोरङका"" in the machine translation, and ""Bijayapur"" is misspelled as ""बिजयपुरका"".
4. Grammar: The machine translation has made some grammatical errors. For example, the verb tense is inconsistent in the machine translation, with ""was killed"" in the past tense, while ""were killed"" in the reference translation is in the plural form.
5. Cultural context: The machine translation lacks cultural context, while the reference translation takes into account the cultural context of the time period. For example, the reference translation uses the term ""Raja"" to refer to the king, which is a term commonly used in Nepal to refer to a king or a monarch.
6. Fluency: The machine translation is not as fluent as the reference translation. The reference translation flows better and is more natural-sounding, while the machine translation sounds more stilted and awkward.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate, fluent, and culturally appropriate than the machine translation. While the machine translation may be useful for basic translation tasks, it is not suitable for more complex or nuanced translations that require a deeper understanding of the language and cultural context.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""members"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses ""organs"" in the first instance and ""organ"" in the second instance. This difference in word choice may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""members"" can refer to any group of people or things, while ""organs"" specifically refer to the internal parts of an organism.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in both instances, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the second instance. This difference in verb tense may affect the time frame in which the gloriousness of the Khas organ is being referred to.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""be proud to be Nepali."" This difference in language use may affect the naturalness and fluency of the translation.
4. Word order: The machine translation uses a different word order in the second instance, with ""called Khas"" appearing after the verb ""has."" The reference translation uses a more common word order, with ""Khas"" appearing before the verb ""has."" This difference in word order may affect the clarity and readability of the translation.
5. Cultural references: The reference translation includes a cultural reference to the Khas people, which may be unfamiliar to non-Nepali speakers. The machine translation does not include this cultural reference, which may affect the accuracy and cultural sensitivity of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, word order, and cultural references. While the machine translation may be more accurate in terms of grammar and word choice, the reference translation is more natural and culturally sensitive. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further translation work.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""And he commanded the father of Shivaji the King.""
	* Reference translation: ""He ordered Shivaji Maharaj 's father to be taken prisoner.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""the King"" to refer to Shivaji, while the reference translation uses the name ""Shivaji Maharaj"" with an apostrophe to indicate possession.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""And he commanded the father of Shivaji the King.""
	* Reference translation: ""He ordered Shivaji Maharaj 's father to be taken prisoner.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the present tense ""commands"" to match the source language, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""ordered"" to match the target language.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""And he commanded the father of Shivaji the King.""
	* Reference translation: ""He ordered Shivaji Maharaj 's father to be taken prisoner.""
	* Difference: The machine translation keeps the word order of the source language, while the reference translation rearranges the words to better match the target language.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""And he commanded the father of Shivaji the King.""
	* Reference translation: ""He ordered Shivaji Maharaj 's father to be taken prisoner.""
	* Difference: The machine translation does not recognize the idiomatic expression ""take prisoner"" in the source language, and instead translates it literally as ""be taken prisoner.""
5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""And he commanded the father of Shivaji the King.""
	* Reference translation: ""He ordered Shivaji Maharaj 's father to be taken prisoner.""
	* Difference: The reference translation includes cultural references that are specific to Nepal, such as ""Shivaji Maharaj,"" which is a revered historical figure in Nepal, and ""be taken prisoner,"" which is a common phrase used in Nepal to refer to someone being arrested or detained.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation differ in several aspects, including word choice, grammar, word order, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic, while the machine translation is more literal and lacks cultural context.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis step by step:

1. Source Text: अतः हनुमान शब्दको अर्थ वेगवान् गतियुक्त शक्ति भन्ने हुन्छ (At: Hanuman word means fast moving force).
2. Machine Translation: अतः हनुमान शब्दको अर्थ वेगवान् गतियुक्त शक्ति भन्ने हुन्छ (At: Hanuman word means wegwan dynasty power).
3. Difference:
The machine translation provides a different meaning than the reference translation. According to the machine translation, Hanuman means ""wegwan dynasty power,"" whereas the reference translation suggests that it means ""a fast moving force.""
4. Reasons for Difference:
There are several reasons why the machine translation provides a different meaning than the reference translation:

a. Lack of Domain Knowledge: The machine translation may not have access to the same domain knowledge as the reference translation. For example, the reference translation may be aware of the historical context and cultural nuances of the Nepali language, which the machine translation may not have.

b. Limited Vocabulary: The machine translation may not have access to a large enough vocabulary to accurately translate the Nepali word ""Hanuman."" It may be translating the word based on its closest match in its training data, which may not be the most accurate translation.

c. Grammatical Errors: The machine translation may make grammatical errors, such as incorrect verb conjugation or word order, which can affect the meaning of the translation.

d. Linguistic Differences: There may be linguistic differences between the source language (Nepali) and the target language (English) that can affect the accuracy of the translation. For example, the word order in Nepali may be different than in English, which can make it difficult for the machine translation to accurately convey the intended meaning.
5. Quality Assessment:
Based on the differences identified above, the quality of the machine translation is lower than the reference translation. The machine translation provides a different meaning than the reference translation, which suggests that it may not have accurately captured the nuances of the Nepali language.

In conclusion, the machine translation of ""अतः हनुमान शब्दको अर्थ वेगवान् गतियुक्त शक्ति भन्ने हुन्छ"" is lower in quality than the reference translation because it provides a different meaning than the reference translation, and may be due to a lack of domain knowledge, limited vocabulary, grammatical errors, or linguistic differences.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""The Provincial Secretary of the palpi, who is jumla run from palpi in the same case,""
	* Reference translation: ""Kamal Raj Regmi , the state secretary who was sent to Jumla from Palpa in the same case and was elected from Palpa from the Communist Party in 2015 , is the second witness .""

The machine translation has a grammatical error in the sentence structure, using the wrong verb tense and subject-verb agreement. The reference translation corrects these errors and provides a more grammatically correct sentence.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""पाल्पाबाट जुम्ला चलान गरिएका प्रदेश सेक्रेटरी""
	* Reference translation: ""Kamal Raj Regmi , the state secretary""

The machine translation uses the word ""पाल्पाबाट"" which means ""of Palpa"" in Nepali, while the reference translation uses the word ""Kamal Raj Regmi"" which is the name of the person being referred to.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""is a lowly witness from the communist party of palpi at 015.""
	* Reference translation: ""is the second witness.""

The machine translation uses an idiomatic expression that is not commonly used in Nepali, and the reference translation provides a more idiomatic and natural-sounding translation.

4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""jumla run from palpi in the same case,""
	* Reference translation: ""Kamal Raj Regmi , the state secretary who was sent to Jumla from Palpa in the same case and was elected from Palpa from the Communist Party in 2015 , is the second witness .""

The machine translation uses the term ""jumla"" which is a Nepali word for ""case"" or ""matter,"" but it is not commonly used in this context. The reference translation provides a more culturally appropriate translation that is more understandable to a Nepali audience.

Overall, the reference translation provides a more accurate, idiomatic, and culturally appropriate translation of the original Nepali text compared to the machine translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar: The machine translation has several grammatical errors, such as the use of ""grows up"" instead of ""grew up"" in the present perfect tense, and the lack of articles in ""the golden age"" and ""the corn."" The reference translation, on the other hand, has corrected these errors and used the correct verb form and articles.
2. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses simpler vocabulary than the reference translation. For example, it uses ""field"" instead of ""khete"" (which means ""field"" in Nepali), and ""corn"" instead of ""maize"" (which is the more common term used in Nepal). The reference translation, on the other hand, uses more appropriate and accurate vocabulary for a Nepali context.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the original Nepali sentence. For example, the phrase ""खेतमा सुनौलो"" (which means ""in his field"") is not translated accurately in the machine translation, and the phrase ""उमारेर अन्न रूपी संपत्ति"" (which means ""the corn into the house"") is not translated at all. The reference translation, on the other hand, captures these idiomatic expressions accurately.
4. Sentence structure: The machine translation does not follow the same sentence structure as the reference translation. The machine translation starts a new sentence after ""जब,"" while the reference translation continues the sentence from where it left off.
5. Tone: The machine translation lacks the warmth and enthusiasm of the reference translation. The reference translation uses more positive and enthusiastic language, such as ""his gladness has no limit"" instead of ""his gladness is no limit,"" which gives a more optimistic and cheerful tone to the sentence.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate, idiomatic, and expressive than the machine translation. While the machine translation may be able to translate the words and phrases correctly, it lacks the cultural and linguistic nuances that are important for conveying the intended meaning and tone of the original Nepali sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""cotillace"" instead of ""Kotilasthan"" in the reference translation. ""Cotillace"" is not a commonly used term in Nepali, and it seems to be a mistake in the machine translation.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""summoned"" instead of ""included"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference in meaning, as ""summoned"" implies a more formal or ritualistic invocation, while ""included"" suggests a more casual or incidental inclusion.
3. Spelling: The machine translation has ""पञ्चकोशी"" instead of ""Panchkoshi"" in the reference translation. ""Panchkoshi"" is the correct spelling of the term in Nepali.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, placing ""someone leaves"" before ""the dung God"" in the reference translation. In Nepali, the typical word order is to place the subject before the verb, so the correct sentence in Nepali would be ""कसै कसैले कोटिलास्थानलाई छोडेर डुङ्गेश्वरलाई पञ्चकोशी भित्र समेटेको पनि पाइन्छ"" (Someone leaves the Kotilasthan, and the Dungeshwar is included within Panchkoshi).

Overall, the machine translation seems to have made several errors in this sentence, including word choice, grammar, spelling, and word order. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic in Nepali.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""In Nepal, this festival is celebrated by smoking, like other smuggling feasts.""
	* Reference translation: ""In Nepal, this festival is celebrated with pomp and like other big festivals.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the present participle ""smoking"" instead of the present tense ""celebrated"" in the reference translation. Additionally, the phrase ""like other smuggling feasts"" is not a correct translation of the original Nepali sentence.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""नेपालमा यो पर्व धुमधाम गरी""
	* Reference translation: ""In Nepal, this festival is celebrated with pomp and like other big festivals.""

4. Cultural context:
	* Machine translation: ""In Nepal, this festival is celebrated by smoking, like other smuggling feasts.""
	* Reference translation: ""In Nepal, this festival is celebrated with pomp and like other big festivals.""
	* Difference: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the original Nepali sentence, which is likely referring to a specific Nepali festival or event.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Joni"" is translated as ""body"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""vagina"".
	* Reference translation: ""Joni"" is correctly translated as ""body"" in the reference translation.
2. Gender agreement:
	* Machine translation: The pronoun ""his"" used to refer to ""Joni"" is in the masculine gender, while the reference translation uses the feminine gender pronoun ""his"".
	* Reference translation: The pronoun ""his"" is correctly translated as ""her"" in the reference translation to match the gender of the noun ""body"".
3. Tense:
	* Machine translation: The verb ""was"" in the machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""became"".
	* Reference translation: The past tense ""became"" is used correctly in the reference translation to indicate that the change occurred in the past.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The word order in the machine translation is different from the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""body"" comes before ""Joni"", while in the reference translation, ""Joni"" comes before ""body"".
	* Reference translation: The word order in the reference translation is correct, with ""Joni"" coming before ""body"".
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""body became full of vagina"" in the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses an idiomatic expression that is more appropriate for the Nepali language.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation differ significantly in terms of word choice, gender agreement, tense, word order, and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation provides a more accurate and natural-sounding translation of the Nepali sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

Machine Translation:

* ""At one time Carthage had desolate labour in the absence of tradition"" - This sentence is grammatically correct, but the word choice is not accurate. ""Desolate"" means something that is barren or uninhabited, but in this context, it doesn't make sense. ""Carthage"" is a city in North Africa, so it's unlikely that it would have ""desolate labour"" there.
* ""from which tradition reaped his fellow sideways"" - This sentence is also grammatically correct, but the word choice is not accurate. ""Reaped"" means to gather or harvest something, but in this context, it doesn't make sense. ""Fellow"" means a companion or associate, but it's unlikely that ""tradition"" would have ""fellow sideways"".

Reference Translation:

* ""Once Kartavirya had destroyed the ashram in Parashuram 's absence"" - This sentence is grammatically correct and accurately conveys the meaning of the original Nepali sentence.
* ""because of which Parashuram angrily cut off his thousand arms"" - This sentence is also grammatically correct and accurately conveys the meaning of the original Nepali sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The machine translation uses word choices that are not accurate and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""tithes"" instead of ""tika and jamara"" in the reference translation. ""Tithes"" is a more general term that refers to a tenth of one's harvest or income, whereas ""tika and jamara"" are specific offerings that are traditionally given during the Dasain festival in Nepal.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""So the special worship..."") instead of the past tense (""Therefore, it is practiced..."") in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""प्रसादस्वरूप"" (prasādasvārūpa) in the reference translation. This expression is commonly used in Nepali to refer to the tenth day of Dasain, and its absence in the machine translation can make it sound less natural.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence slightly, placing ""and the tenth day"" after ""So the special worship"" instead of after ""it is practice to worship Bhagwati"". This can make the sentence sound less clear and concise.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation ""receive tithes and jams"" is not entirely accurate, as ""tithes"" is not a common term used in Nepal during the Dasain festival. The reference translation ""receive tika and jamara"" is more accurate, as ""tika"" and ""jamara"" are specific offerings that are traditionally given during the festival.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation is more precise in its word choice and grammar, and it includes idiomatic expressions that are commonly used in Nepali.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""closure"" instead of ""influence"" in the reference translation. ""Closure"" generally refers to the act of closing or ending something, while ""influence"" refers to the power or effect that something has on something else. In this context, ""influence"" is a more appropriate word choice to convey the meaning of the original Nepali sentence.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""can still be seen"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""can still be seen""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""business of the western part of Tanahun"". This expression is more natural in Nepali and conveys the meaning of the original sentence more accurately.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""of the western region"" is placed after the verb ""can still be seen"", while in the reference translation, it is placed before the verb. This difference in word order can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, with the reference translation conveying a more natural and idiomatic structure.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation makes a minor error in the word ""Tanahun"", which is spelled incorrectly as ""Tanahum"". This error can affect the accuracy of the translation.

	* Machine translation: ""नभएपनि"" is translated as ""there were no actions"" instead of ""no actions immediately following"".
	* Reference translation: ""नभएपनि"" is translated correctly as ""no actions immediately following"".
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""खोज्ने चाहना"" is translated as ""seek a way"" instead of ""find a way"".
	* Reference translation: ""खोज्ने चाहना"" is translated correctly as ""find a way"".
5. Cultural references:

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation: ""After the breakup, children are considered to be in joint negotiations.""

Reference Translation: ""Children are considered to be under joint supervision after divorce.""

Here are the differences I found between the two translations:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""negotiations"" instead of ""supervision."" While ""negotiations"" is a valid translation of the Nepali word ""संयुक्त निगरानी"" (sanyukta nigarani), it doesn't convey the same meaning as ""supervision."" In this context, ""supervision"" is a more appropriate choice to convey the idea of children being under the care and control of both parents after a divorce.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are considered"") instead of the past tense (""were considered"") in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expression: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""after divorce"" to convey the idea of the children being under joint supervision after their parents' divorce. The machine translation doesn't use any idiomatic expression, which can make it sound less natural and less accurate.
4. Cultural context: The reference translation takes into account the cultural context of Nepal, where divorce is a relatively new concept and the legal system is still evolving. The reference translation uses the phrase ""after divorce"" to convey the idea that the children are under joint supervision, which is a common practice in Nepal. The machine translation, on the other hand, doesn't take into account the cultural context and uses a more general term (""joint negotiations"") that may not be as accurate or culturally relevant.

Overall, while both translations are grammatically correct, the reference translation is more accurate and culturally relevant. The machine translation could benefit from taking into account the cultural context and using more appropriate terminology to convey the intended meaning.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Bharat Tulsipur neglected to worship the existing Patan Devi's festival"" - The sentence structure is awkward and the use of ""neglected"" is incorrect. It should be ""Bharat Tulsipur did not worship the existing Patan Devi's festival.""
	* Reference translation: ""While the Bhatta Brahmins of Pyuthan used to go to worship at the festival of goddess Patan near Tulsipur , India , over time , they started worshiping Goddess Kalika"" - The sentence structure is more natural and the use of ""used to"" is appropriate.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""if the veteran brahmins of pune were known to have worshipped the kalika devi's revenge"" - The word ""revenge"" is not appropriate in this context. It should be ""the goddess Kalika's revenge"" or ""the goddess Kalika's wrath.""
	* Reference translation: ""Goddess Kalika"" - The reference translation uses the correct term for the goddess, which is ""Kalika Devi.""
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Bharat Tulsipur neglected to worship the existing Patan Devi's festival"" - The phrase ""existing Patan Devi's festival"" is not a common expression in Nepali. It should be ""the festival of goddess Patan.""
	* Reference translation: ""over time , they started worshiping Goddess Kalika"" - The phrase ""over time"" is not a common expression in Nepali. It should be ""little by little"" or ""gradually.""
4. Cultural and historical accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""Bharat Tulsipur neglected to worship the existing Patan Devi's festival"" - The name ""Bharat Tulsipur"" is not a recognized name in Nepali history or culture. It should be ""Tulsipur"" or ""Bhaktapur.""
	* Reference translation: ""the festival of goddess Patan near Tulsipur , India"" - The reference translation is more accurate as ""Tulsipur"" is a city in Nepal, not India.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not of high quality. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and natural-sounding in Nepali.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""flame"" twice in the sentence, which is not necessary. In the reference translation, the word ""Jwala"" is used instead of ""flame"" to refer to the same thing.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a relative clause (""on the other edge of the navy brook"") to modify the noun ""house,"" while the reference translation uses a prepositional phrase (""across the Jwala house"") to modify the verb ""is.""
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""नाभी खोलाको"" (naabhi kholako), which means ""on the other side"" in Nepali. The reference translation uses the phrase ""across the Jwala house"" to convey the same meaning.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""the flame house"" come before ""next to,"" while in the reference translation, they come after.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation gets the location of the Jwala temple wrong. According to the reference translation, the Jwala temple is located ""across the Jwala house,"" which is not the same as the machine translation's ""next to the flame house.""

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the Nepali sentence. The reference translation uses more idiomatic expressions and follows the correct grammatical structure of Nepali, which makes it a more reliable translation.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""Wss service"" are placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, they are placed at the end.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense (""has been vingri"") while the reference translation uses the present tense (""has launched""). This suggests that the machine translation may not have accurately captured the intended tense of the original Nepali sentence.
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""vingri"" instead of ""Bhingri"" in the reference translation. ""Vingri"" is not a commonly used word in Nepali, and it may not be the best choice to convey the intended meaning.
4. Grammar: The machine translation has a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence is structured as a simple sentence, while in the reference translation, it is structured as a compound sentence with a subordinate clause.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""चकचके देखि"" (chakchake dekhi) in the reference translation. This is a common idiomatic expression in Nepali that is used to indicate that something is happening or has happened suddenly or unexpectedly.

Overall, the machine translation does not seem to be as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation.

Differences:

2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense in both the source and target languages, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the target language to indicate that the curse has already been pronounced.
3. Idiomatic expression: The machine translation uses a literal translation of the Nepali phrase ""जडबुद्ध हुने श्राप"" (jadbudd hunne shrapa), which means ""to become stupid,"" while the reference translation uses a more idiomatic expression in English, ""became stupid,"" to convey the same meaning.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""cursed"" in the active voice, while the reference translation uses the passive voice to convey that Jamadgni's sons were cursed by him.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the Nepali sentence. The reference translation provides a more idiomatic and natural-sounding English translation, while the machine translation is more literal and lacks contextual nuance.

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the second sentence.
2. Vocabulary:

2. Machine Translation: Someone means it as a serpent's possessor. (Source: Google Translate)

Difference:

* The machine translation uses the phrase ""someone means it as"" instead of ""interpret it as"" in the reference translation.
* The machine translation uses the word ""serpent's possessor"" instead of ""intercourse of snakes"" in the reference translation.

Analysis:

* The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the context of the original Nepali sentence. The word ""sarpako"" in Nepali means ""snakes,"" and ""sambhog"" means ""intercourse"" or ""union."" So, the original sentence is actually referring to the act of snakes mating or copulating.
* The machine translation's use of ""serpent's possessor"" is incorrect because it implies that someone is the owner or possessor of a serpent, which is not the intended meaning of the original sentence.
* The reference translation, on the other hand, accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence by using the phrase ""interpret it as the intercourse of snakes.""

The machine translation has several grammatical errors, including the incorrect use of ""pseudonym"" (which is not a Nepali word), the incorrect placement of ""near"" in the phrase ""near the afzal khanate of status,"" and the lack of a verb tense consistency in the sentence.

2. Vocabulary:

	* Reference translation: ""Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation""

The machine translation uses the term ""afzal khanate of status,"" which is not a recognized Nepali phrase. The reference translation uses the more common phrase ""Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation,"" which is a more accurate and idiomatic expression in Nepali.

3. Idioms and expressions:

This difference in tense does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does indicate that the reference translation is more accurate in terms of verb conjugation.
3. Word order: The machine translation rearranges the words in the sentence to create a more awkward phrasing. In the reference translation, the words are arranged in a more logical and natural order.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""philosophy of life"" to convey the idea of the prince's teachings.

Both words are acceptable, but the reference translation is more accurate as it uses the correct Nepali spelling of the word.
3. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include any punctuation after the phrase ""Proofs supporting the use of steroids in COPD,"" while the reference translation includes a period at the end of the sentence. The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as punctuation is important for clarity and readability.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""publish"" in the third person singular form, while the reference translation uses the verb ""was published"" in the past perfect tense.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""barrier"" to translate ""परिवेशमा"" (pariveśamā), which is a more general term that can refer to any obstacle or hindrance. In contrast, the reference translation uses ""characteristics"" to translate ""परिष्कार"" (parishkāra), which specifically refers to the qualities or attributes of something.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""introduced"" to translate ""परिवेशमा"" (pariveśamā), which is in the present tense. However, the reference translation uses the verb ""selection"" to translate ""परिणाम"" (parināma), which is in the past tense and refers to the process of selecting or choosing something.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, placing ""in the environment"" after ""language"" instead of before it. This is a common error in machine translation, as the algorithm may not always prioritize the correct word order.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the phrase ""repeatedly refined and modified"" to translate ""परिमार्जन"" (parimārjan), which is an idiomatic expression that means ""to improve or perfect something through repeated attempts or modifications."" The machine translation does not capture this nuance and simply translates it as ""modified in characteristics.""

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""filled in"" instead of ""joined"" to translate ""भर्ती भए"" (bharti bhaye). This is a common mistake in machine translations, as ""filled in"" does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Nepali phrase.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is"" to translate ""ब्रिटिस इन्डियन आर्मीमै"" (British Indian Army), while the reference translation uses the past tense ""joined"" to translate the same phrase. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""did not necessarily follow that way"" after ""Bahadur Singh Beral"" instead of after ""the son of Sarvajit"". This is a common mistake in machine translations, as they often struggle with sentence structure and word order.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""खड्गजीतले"" (khadgajitle), which means ""while"" or ""as"". This is a common problem in machine translations, as they often lack the ability to understand and translate idiomatic expressions.
5. Names: The machine translation spells the name of Bahadur Singh Beral as ""Bahadur Singh Baral"", which is an incorrect spelling.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, tense, word order, idiomatic expressions, and spelling. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality score than the machine translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Indradik"" is translated as ""Idradic gods"" instead of ""Indra and other gods"" or ""Indra and his followers"" as per the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: ""Bhrihaspati"" is translated as ""Bhagavana"" instead of ""Brihaspati"" as per the reference translation.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is different in the machine translation, with the verb ""went"" placed at the end of the sentence. In the reference translation, the verb is placed in the correct position.
	* Reference translation: The use of ""together with"" is more appropriate than ""including"" in this context.
3. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Natamastak"" is translated as ""wedding"" instead of ""Vedmantra being natamastak"" as per the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: ""Praised the goddess"" is a more accurate translation of ""नतमस्तक भएर वेदमन्त्रद्वारा"" than ""praised the god"" as per the machine translation.
4. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation seems to struggle with the complex sentence structure and word choice in the original Nepali sentence, resulting in a less fluent and less accurate translation.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and fluent than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence better, including the correct word choice, grammar, and vocabulary. The machine translation, on the other hand, seems to struggle with the complexities of the sentence and results in a less accurate and less fluent translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""मन्त्री जस्ता पदमा"" (ministry)
	* Reference translation: ""alumni of this school""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""मन्त्री"" (minister) which is not accurate as the context suggests that the alumni are not necessarily holding positions of authority.
2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""सालको परिवर्तनपछि"" (after the change of the year 2007)
	* Reference translation: ""After the change in 2007""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the past tense ""सालको"" (after the change of the year 2007) while the reference translation uses the present tense ""After the change in 2007"".
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""मन्त्री जस्ता पदमा मात्र होइन"" (not only in the post of minister but also in other higher posts)
	* Reference translation: ""not only in the post of minister but also in other higher posts""
	* Difference: The machine translation reverses the word order in the second part of the sentence, making it less clear and concise.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""यसै स्कूलका भूतपूर्व विद्यार्थीहरुथुप्रै"" (as many as the school's alumni)
	* Reference translation: ""as many as the school's alumni""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a less common idiomatic expression ""भूतपूर्व विद्यार्थीहरुथुप्रै"" which may not be easily understandable for non-native speakers.
5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""देखिएकै छन्"" (as many as seen)
	* Reference translation: ""as many as seen""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb form ""देखिएकै"" which is not grammatically correct in this context.

Overall, the machine translation has several errors in word choice, tense, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar, which can affect the overall quality of the translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and natural-sounding.

2. Tone: The machine translation gives a more literal translation of the Nepali sentence, while the reference translation adds a more poetic and literary tone to the translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""तुलसी दल"" (Tulsi dal), which is a common phrase used in Nepali to refer to the worship of Tulsi. The reference translation includes this idiomatic expression, which gives a more natural and fluent translation.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense for all the verbs in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the present and past tenses appropriately to convey the intended meaning.
5. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence slightly, placing the adjective ""four burdens"" before the noun ""silver"", while the reference translation maintains the original word order of the Nepali sentence.
6. Cultural references: The reference translation includes a cultural reference to ""gold"", which is a valuable and sacred metal in Nepali culture. The machine translation does not include this cultural reference, which may make the translation less accurate and less culturally relevant.

Overall, while the machine translation provides a literal translation of the Nepali sentence, it lacks the poetic and cultural nuances that are present in the reference translation. Therefore, I would give a higher quality rating to the reference translation.

Machine Translation:

* The gods of Teddy are 12 gods of Rai, and the princes and standards.

Reference Translation:

* Kariya 12 gods of Tedi god are Raika Shahi and Khadayat .

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses the name ""Teddy"" instead of ""Tedi"" in the reference translation.
2. The machine translation refers to the gods as ""Rai"" and ""princes and standards"" instead of ""Raika Shahi and Khadayat"" in the reference translation.
3. The machine translation omits the word ""are"" after ""gods"" in the reference translation.

Quality Evaluation:

Based on the differences I've identified, the machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation. Here's why:

1. Inaccurate word choice: The machine translation uses the name ""Teddy"" instead of ""Tedi"", which is the correct spelling in Nepali. This is a minor error, but it shows that the machine translation may not have been trained on accurate data.
2. Incorrect grammar: The machine translation omits the word ""are"" after ""gods"" in the reference translation. This is a basic grammatical error that a human translator would be expected to catch.
3. Inconsistent terminology: The machine translation uses the term ""Rai"" to refer to the gods, while the reference translation uses ""Raika Shahi and Khadayat"". This inconsistency suggests that the machine translation may not have been trained on a consistent terminology for the Nepali language.

Overall, the machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation due to inaccuracies in word choice, grammar, and terminology. A human translator would be expected to produce a more accurate and consistent translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""stealing"" to translate ""चोख्याउने"" (chokhyaune), which is not the most appropriate word choice. In this context, ""stealing"" implies theft, which may not be the correct meaning of the original Nepali word. A better translation would be ""cleansing"" or ""purification"".
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the wrong verb form in the sentence. The verb ""is done"" should be in the present tense to match the present tense of the sentence, so it should be ""The act of stealing is generally done..."".
3. Phrasing: The machine translation uses a different phrasing than the reference translation. The machine translation uses ""on the fourth or sixth day of the shishu birthday"" while the reference translation uses ""in Newar"". This may be due to a difference in cultural or linguistic context.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""चौंथो वा छैंठो दिनमा"" (chauthho va chaintho dinma), which is a common expression in Nepali. This expression is used to indicate the time frame within which an event is expected to happen.
5. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, which can make it difficult to understand. In the machine translation, the words ""of stealing"" are separated from the verb ""is done"", which can make the sentence sound awkward.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The reference translation captures the cultural and linguistic nuances of the sentence more effectively, and the word choice and phrasing are more appropriate.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""adaptation"" instead of ""favour"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tone: The machine translation uses the word ""hard labour"" which has a more formal tone than the reference translation's ""hard work and strength of understanding"". The reference translation's phrase is more conversational and conveys a sense of effort and dedication.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""miniature and suggestive ballads"" which is not a common idiomatic expression in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses the phrase ""safalta"" which is a more common and idiomatic way to express success in Nepali.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense for the verb ""succeeds"" in both parts of the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense for the verb ""is successful"" in the second part of the sentence. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall grammar of the sentence.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation uses the name ""Saturn"" which may not be immediately familiar to all Nepali speakers. In contrast, the reference translation uses the more common term ""Satyo"" which is more culturally relevant.

Overall, the reference translation is more idiomatic and culturally relevant than the machine translation. It also conveys a more conversational tone and uses more common phrases that are easier to understand for a Nepali speaker. However, the machine translation is still understandable and gets the general meaning of the sentence across.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""rebuilding"" twice, while the reference translation uses the word ""win back"" once. This difference in word choice may not have a significant impact on the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does show that the machine translation is not able to capture the nuances of the original Nepali sentence as accurately.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense verbs ""reinstating"" and ""rebuilding"" consistently throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense verb ""won"" in the second part of the sentence. This difference in verb tense may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately convey the time frame of the action being described.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""win back"" to convey the idea of regaining something that was previously lost, while the machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions. This difference in language use may indicate that the reference translation is more natural and idiomatic in Nepali.
4. Fluency: The machine translation seems to struggle with the sentence structure and word order, resulting in a less fluent and less natural-sounding translation compared to the reference translation. For example, the machine translation places the verb ""rebuilding"" after the noun ""program,"" which is not the typical word order in Nepali.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding compared to the machine translation. While the machine translation may be able to generate a rough translation of the sentence, it is not able to capture the nuances and complexities of the original Nepali sentence as accurately as the reference translation. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the primary source for communication.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""remains"" instead of ""remains active"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. In the reference translation, ""remains active"" conveys the idea of continued activity and vitality, while ""remains"" simply means ""stays"".
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""If a man remains active..."") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""If a person remains active...""). This difference is due to the fact that the reference translation is a literal translation of the original Nepali sentence, which was written in the past tense.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the verb ""remains"" comes after the subject ""a man"", while in the reference translation, it comes before the subject. This difference in word order can affect the emphasis and flow of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""such person"" to refer to the active elderly person, while the machine translation does not use any idiomatic expression. This difference in language use can affect the naturalness and fluency of the translation.
5. Cultural nuances: The reference translation includes a cultural nuance by using the phrase ""yuvāvasthākō"" (youthful man), which is a term commonly used in Nepali to refer to an elderly person who is still active and vital. The machine translation does not include this cultural nuance.

Overall, the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are relatively minor, but they can affect the accuracy, naturalness, and cultural appropriateness of the translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""rods"" instead of ""flames"" in the first line, which is a significant difference. ""Rods"" is not a common term used in Nepali to refer to fire, and it doesn't convey the same meaning as ""flames.""
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are burning"") in the first line, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""were burning""). This difference in tense can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't quite capture the idiomatic expression ""the voice of the exploding etiquette"" in the second line. This phrase is not a literal translation of any Nepali phrase, and it doesn't convey the same meaning as the reference translation.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""shall be"" in the first line, which is not necessary in Nepali. In Nepali, the verb ""burn"" is already in the present tense, so ""And the flames of fire shall be burning in the night"" would be a more natural sentence.
5. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses the word ""exploding"" in the second line, which is not a common term used in Nepali. In Nepali, the phrase ""etc."" is used to indicate a list of things, so ""there are sounds of explosions etc."" would be a more natural sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The machine translation uses some words and phrases that are not commonly used in Nepali, and it doesn't capture the idiomatic expressions and cultural nuances of the language. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating in terms of quality compared to the reference translation.

Machine Translation:

* ""Furthermore, the monastery had been the principal industry of Babylon.""

Reference Translation:

Key differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""monastery"" instead of ""pisciculture"" in the reference translation.
2. Industry type: The machine translation implies that the monastery was the principal industry of Babylon, while the reference translation specifically mentions pisciculture (fish farming) as one of the major industries.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present perfect tense (""had been"") to indicate that the monastery was the principal industry of Babylon in the past, while the reference translation uses the present simple tense (""is"") to indicate that pisciculture is one of the major industries of Babylon.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""principal industry"" which may not be commonly used in Nepali language, while the reference translation uses the more idiomatic expression ""major industries"".

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The reference translation provides a more natural and idiomatic expression, and accurately reflects the intended meaning of the sentence.

This difference in word choice may not have a significant impact on the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does show that the machine translation may not have fully captured the nuances of the original Nepali text.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""enjoyed"") to describe the history of the Bhadra verse, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""elaborates""). This difference in grammar may indicate that the machine translation is not fully accurate in its translation of the Nepali text.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""olive shlok,"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. In contrast, the reference translation uses the phrase ""Bhadra verse of the Sama Veda,"" which is a more accurate and idiomatic way of translating the Nepali text.
4. Sentence structure: The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a single sentence, while the reference translation uses two sentences. This difference in sentence structure may indicate that the machine translation is not fully able to capture the complexity of the original Nepali text.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation does not include any cultural references, while the reference translation includes a cultural reference to ""Maharshi Gautam."" This difference may indicate that the machine translation is not fully able to capture the cultural context of the original Nepali text.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, sentence structure, and cultural references. These differences suggest that the machine translation may not be fully accurate or idiomatic in its translation of the Nepali text.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""joggers"" instead of ""sages"" in the reference translation. This is a common error in machine translations, as they often struggle to accurately translate technical or specialized terms.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""celebrate"") in both instances, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""celebrated"") in the second sentence. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""chandigarh"" in the reference translation. In Nepali, ""chandigarh"" is a term used to refer to the full moon day of the lunar month, which is an important festival in Nepal.
4. Cultural references: The machine translation does not include the cultural reference to ""sages"" in the reference translation. In Nepali culture, sages are highly respected individuals who are believed to possess spiritual wisdom and knowledge.
5. Tone and style: The machine translation has a more informal tone than the reference translation, which is more formal and literary. This is because machine translations often struggle to capture the nuances of language and culture, leading to a loss of tone and style.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or nuanced as the reference translation.

2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is hard"") in the source sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was difficult""). This difference in tense can change the nuance of the sentence, as the present tense implies a more general or ongoing difficulty, while the past tense suggests a more specific or past difficulty.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the source sentence, placing ""it"" before ""is"" instead of after it. This can make the sentence harder to read and understand, as the word order is not as clear.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""हुन त सर्पलाई"" (hun ta sarpali) in the source sentence, which means ""to be a snake."" This is a common idiomatic expression in Nepali, and its absence can make the translation less natural-sounding.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""distinguish"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""distinguish"" in the past tense.

Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""at the corner of"" to indicate Vince's location, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""hit the Rock with steel chair"". These idiomatic expressions are important for conveying the intended meaning of the sentence.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""corpse of steel"" after ""Vince remained"". In the reference translation, the word order is maintained, with ""Vince was in the corner of the Rock"" followed by ""he hit the Rock with steel chair"".
5. Accuracy: The machine translation is not accurate in its translation of the Nepali sentence.

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation provides a clear and concise translation of the sentence, with each word accurately conveyed in English.
* The translation captures the overall meaning of the original sentence, which is about the impact of the Second World War on human civilization.
* However, there are some minor errors in the translation:
	+ ""द्वितीय विश्वयुद्धपछि"" is translated as ""After the secondary world war,"" which is not entirely accurate. The correct translation would be ""After the Second World War.""
	+ ""मानव सभ्यतामा"" is translated as ""human civilizations,"" which is a bit broad and could be more specific. A more accurate translation would be ""human societies.""
	+ ""आदि कुरालाई"" is translated as ""etc.,"" which is a bit vague. A more accurate translation would be ""and other things.""
	+ ""देखाएर"" is translated as ""showing things,"" which is a bit awkward. A more accurate translation would be ""depicted.""
	+ ""रचना भएका"" is translated as ""constructed using the majority,"" which is not entirely accurate. The correct translation would be ""written.""

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation provides a more nuanced and accurate translation of the sentence, capturing the subtleties of the original Nepali text.
* The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the sentence, which is about the frustrations, futility, and other emotions that entered into human civilization after the Second World War.
* The translation also captures the literary style of the original sentence, which is an epic poem.

While both words can be used to describe wide-angle views, ""monumental"" implies something grand or impressive, while ""panoramic"" is more neutral and simply means ""wide-angle.""
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""you can flood"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""you did Jalbihar""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and naturalness of the translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""flood the ridge,"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali. In Nepali, ""Jalbihar"" is a more common term for observing waterfalls, and ""ridge"" is not a term used in Nepali to describe a location.
4. Names of locations: The machine translation uses the name ""Bakli Khola"" for the location where the waterfalls are located, while the reference translation uses ""Ridikhola."" Both names are valid, but ""Ridikhola"" is more commonly used in Nepali.
5. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order in the sentence, placing ""if you can"" at the beginning instead of ""you can."" This can make the sentence sound less natural and less clear.

4. Plural nouns: In the machine translation, the word ""days"" is translated as ""दिन"" (Nepali word for ""day"") which is incorrect. In English, ""days"" is a plural noun and should be translated as ""दिने"" (Nepali word for ""days"").
5. Grammar: In the machine translation, the sentence structure is not as clear and concise as in the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure, which can make it harder to understand for non-native speakers.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, article usage, date, plural nouns, and grammar.

Reference Translation:

* ""Shristhan is one of the places among the five places of panchakoshi.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""Mr."" to refer to the person, while the reference translation uses ""Shristhan"" which is the correct Nepali word for the place.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""is"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""is"" in the third person singular form.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""among"" after ""places"" instead of before it.
4. Agency: The machine translation uses the phrase ""panchkoshi agency"" which is not a correct or common term in Nepali. The reference translation uses the more common term ""panchakoshi"".
5. Accuracy: The machine translation gets the meaning of the sentence correct, but the word choice and grammar are not accurate.

Overall, the machine translation is not very accurate and the word choice and grammar are not correct. The reference translation is more accurate and uses more appropriate Nepali words and grammar.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given source:

Machine Translation:

* ""While normally held"" is not a correct translation of the Nepali phrase ""सामान्यरूपले हेर्दा"". The correct translation for this phrase is ""In general"".
* ""some activity of the moon"" is not a correct translation of the Nepali phrase ""रूपचन्द्रका केही क्रियाकलाप"". The correct translation for this phrase is ""Rup Chandra's activities"".
* ""is likely to be arranged"" is not a correct translation of the Nepali phrase ""अराजकजस्ता लाग्दछन्"". The correct translation for this phrase is ""seem anarchist"".

Reference Translation:

* ""In general"" is a correct translation of the Nepali phrase ""सामान्यरूपले हेर्दा"".
* ""Rup Chandra's activities"" is a correct translation of the Nepali phrase ""रूपचन्द्रका केही क्रियाकलाप"".
* ""seem anarchist"" is a correct translation of the Nepali phrase ""अराजकजस्ता लाग्दछन्"".

Based on my analysis, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the meaning of the Nepali phrase more closely and uses more appropriate language for a native English speaker. The machine translation, on the other hand, makes some significant errors in translation, such as using the wrong word order and making grammatical mistakes.

Overall, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""punk"" (उत्पन्न)
	* Reference translation: ""Punk"" (पंक)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Nepali word ""utpann"" (उत्पन्न), which means ""strain"" or ""tension"", while the reference translation uses the English word ""Punk"".
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""In the beginning day of 2014, strain was caused between The Cild due to punk.""
	* Reference translation: ""In the early days of 2014, tensions between The Shield erupted due to Punk.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense in the sentence. The correct verb tense should be ""erupted"" instead of ""was caused"" to match the reference translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""सुरुवाती दिनमा"" (in the beginning day)
	* Reference translation: ""early days""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a literal translation of ""सुरुवाती दिनमा"" which means ""in the beginning day"", while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""early days"" to convey the same meaning.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""द सिल्ड बीच तनाव उत्पन्न भएको थियो.""
	* Reference translation: ""Tensions between The Shield erupted due to Punk.""
	* Difference: The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, which makes it difficult to understand the meaning. The reference translation maintains the original word order to convey the intended meaning.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not of high quality. The reference translation provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Nepali sentence. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further translation work.

4. Dates: In the machine translation, the date ""2031"" is written, while in the reference translation, the date ""2031 B.S."" is written.
5. Word choice: In the machine translation, the word ""Heavenly"" is used, while in the reference translation, the word ""late"" is used.
6. Grammar: In the machine translation, the sentence structure is different than in the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence is written in a more straightforward manner, while in the reference translation, the sentence is written in a more formal and complex manner.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation uses simpler language and a more straightforward sentence structure, while the reference translation uses more formal language and a more complex sentence structure. Additionally, the machine translation makes a few errors in spelling and word choice, which can affect the overall quality of the translation. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable source for Nepali-English translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""W Bush"" instead of ""W. Bush"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall readability and accuracy of the translation.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""met"") in the first sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""met with"") to indicate a past event. This is a more accurate representation of the original Nepali sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""third world"" used in the reference translation. This is a common idiom used to refer to developing countries or countries with low economic standards of living.
4. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the second sentence, with ""about"" appearing before ""the Libyans"". In the reference translation, the word order is correct, with ""the Libyans"" appearing after ""W. Bush"".
5. Accuracy: The machine translation completely misses the meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The reference translation accurately conveys the idea that W. Bush proposed that the Libyans enter the Third World.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation.

Machine translation: Species in the holly include: Red, green, yellow and blue colours more commonly used.
Reference translation: Red , green , yellow and blue colors are especially used in Holi .

Step 1: Identify the differences between the source and machine translation:

* The machine translation uses the word ""species"" instead of ""holly"" in the source sentence.
* The machine translation uses the word ""colours"" instead of ""colour"" in the source sentence.
* The machine translation omits the word ""especially"" in the reference translation.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

* The machine translation uses a more general term ""species"" to refer to the holly plant, while the reference translation uses a more specific term ""holly"".
* The machine translation uses the plural form ""colours"" to refer to the different colors used in Holi, while the reference translation uses the singular form ""colour"".
* The machine translation omits the word ""especially"" which emphasizes the use of red, green, yellow, and blue colors in Holi.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation:

* The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source sentence, as it uses a different term to refer to the holly plant and omits an important phrase that emphasizes the use of certain colors in Holi.
* The machine translation also uses a more general term for ""colours"" which may not be accurate for the context of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is of poor quality as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source sentence and uses inappropriate terminology. A better translation would be:

Machine translation: Holi is especially known for the use of red, green, yellow, and blue colours.

This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and uses appropriate terminology for the context.

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in both sentences, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the second sentence to match the verb tense of the original Nepali sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""पनि नाचमा"" which means ""according to"" in Nepali. The reference translation uses ""according to"" to convey the same meaning.
4. Cultural references: The machine translation doesn't include the cultural reference to ""maruni dance"" in the first sentence, which is an important contextual detail in Nepali. The reference translation includes this cultural reference to help readers understand the context of the sentence.
5. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the second sentence to make it more grammatically correct in English. The reference translation maintains the original word order of the Nepali sentence.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the machine translation and the reference translation for the given Nepali sentence.

Machine Translation:

* ""This festival is also known as tilwachura because of the use of til and chiura.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Since sesame and beaten rice are used extensively in this festival, it is also known as Tilvachiura.""

Step 1: Identify the source language (Nepali) and the target language (English)

Both the machine translation and the reference translation are in English, so we can skip this step.

Step 2: Identify the type of translation (direct, indirect, free, formal, informal, etc.)

The machine translation is an indirect translation, as it uses a pre-existing translation memory or rule-based system to generate the translation, rather than a human translator's direct interpretation of the source language text.

Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the translation

Accuracy refers to how closely the translation conveys the meaning and content of the source language text. Here's how the machine translation and the reference translation compare in terms of accuracy:

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation accurately translates the word ""til"" as ""sesame"" and ""chiura"" as ""beaten rice"".
* However, it does not accurately convey the meaning of the phrase ""tilwachura"", which is a compound word in Nepali. The machine translation simply translates each word separately, rather than considering the context and meaning of the phrase as a whole.

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase ""tilwachura"" by translating it as ""Since sesame and beaten rice are used extensively in this festival, it is also known as Tilvachiura.""
* The reference translation also accurately translates the words ""til"" and ""chiura"" as ""sesame"" and ""beaten rice"", respectively.

Step 4: Evaluate the fluency of the translation

Fluency refers to how well the translation reads and sounds in the target language. Here's how the machine translation and the reference translation compare in terms of fluency:

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation has a somewhat awkward and stilted flow, which can make it difficult to understand for non-native speakers.
* The use of the phrase ""because of the use of til and chiura"" is not particularly idiomatic or natural-sounding in English.

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation has a more natural and fluid flow, which makes it easier to understand for non-native speakers.
* The use of the phrase ""Since sesame and beaten rice are used extensively in this festival"" is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English.

Step 5: Evaluate the cultural appropriateness of the translation

Cultural appropriateness refers to how well the translation takes into account the cultural context and nuances of the source language text. Here's how the machine translation and the reference translation compare in terms of cultural appropriateness:

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the source language text, as it simply translates each word separately without considering the broader cultural context.
* The use of the phrase ""tilwachura"" may not be immediately familiar to non-Nepali speakers, as it is a compound word that is specific to the Nepali language and culture.

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation takes into account the cultural context of the source language text by translating the phrase ""tilwachura"" as ""Since sesame and beaten rice are used extensively in this festival"".
* The use of the phrase ""Tilvachiura"" is more culturally appropriate, as it is a more common and widely-used term in Nepali culture.

Based on these evaluations, it is clear that the reference translation is a more accurate, fluent, and culturally appropriate translation of the Nepali sentence than the machine translation. The reference translation takes into account the cultural context and nuances of the source language text, and provides a more natural and idiomatic translation in the target language.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""low in his sight""
	* Reference translation: ""very few people like you in his eyes""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""low in his sight"" to translate the Nepali phrase ""नजरमा विल्कुलै"". However, this phrase is not a direct translation of the original Nepali phrase, which means ""There were very few people like you in his eyes"". The machine translation changes the meaning of the phrase slightly, implying that the men were not highly regarded in the person's eyes, rather than being rare or unique.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is slightly different in the machine translation, with the verb ""were"" in the past tense.
	* Reference translation: The sentence structure is the same in both translations.

The machine translation changes the verb tense from the original Nepali sentence, which is in the present tense. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less idiomatic in English.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""in his eyes"" in the same way as the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: ""in his eyes"" is used to convey the idea that the person finds the men rare or unique.

The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""in his eyes"" to convey the idea that the person finds the men rare or unique, which is not explicitly stated in the machine translation.

4. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the cultural nuance of the original Nepali phrase.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation captures the cultural nuance of the original Nepali phrase, which is a common way of expressing admiration or respect in Nepali culture.

The machine translation does not capture the cultural nuance of the original Nepali phrase, which is a common way of expressing admiration or respect in Nepali culture. The reference translation, on the other hand, captures this nuance and conveys it more accurately in English.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the meaning and cultural nuance of the original Nepali phrase more accurately, while the machine translation changes the meaning slightly and uses less idiomatic language.

3. Names: The machine translation refers to ""the goddess mercury"" and ""Mangaldasji Maharaj"" in the reference translation, while the original Nepali text uses ""Krishna"" and ""Mangaldasji Maharaj"". This suggests that the machine translation may not have accurately translated the names of the religious figures in the original text.
4. Fluency: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation, with awkward phrasing and word choices that can make it difficult to understand the intended meaning.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation (MT):

* The sentence is translated as ""Submerged from planet sufficient space to first space and if guided.""
* The word ""सप्तमस्थान"" (saptamasthān) is translated as ""planet,"" which is incorrect. In Nepali, ""सप्तमस्थान"" specifically refers to the seventh planet from the Sun, which is Saturn.
* The word ""प्रथमस्थान"" (prathamasthān) is translated as ""first space,"" which is also incorrect. In Nepali, ""प्रथमस्थान"" specifically refers to the first house or the ascendant in astrology.
* The phrase ""if guided"" is added at the end of the sentence, which is not present in the original Nepali sentence.

Reference Translation (RT):

* The sentence is translated as ""If all the planets from the seventh place to the first place make auspicious Chhatra Yoga.""
* The word ""सप्तमस्थान"" (saptamasthān) is translated correctly as ""seventh place.""
* The word ""प्रथमस्थान"" (prathamasthān) is translated correctly as ""first place.""
* The phrase ""make auspicious Chhatra Yoga"" is translated correctly. In Nepali, ""Chhatra Yoga"" refers to the astrological influence of the position of the planets in a person's birth chart.

Based on my analysis, the reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation in terms of the translation of the Nepali words and the context of the sentence. The machine translation adds an extra phrase at the end of the sentence, which is not present in the original Nepali sentence. Therefore, I would give a higher rating to the reference translation.

Machine Translation:

* ""Here the convict sent a contestant named keriyar to daman.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Here Convention sent individual named Keriyer for oppression.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""convict"" instead of ""Convention"" in the reference translation.
2. Noun agreement: In the machine translation, the noun ""contestant"" does not agree with the gender of the pronoun ""his"" in the phrase ""his daman."" In the reference translation, the noun ""individual"" agrees with the gender of the pronoun ""his.""
3. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""Here... sent"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""Here Convention... sent"").
4. Meaning: The machine translation seems to be using a more literal translation of the Nepali sentence, while the reference translation provides a more idiomatic and natural-sounding English translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a better understanding of the original Nepali sentence and is more idiomatic in English.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""bail"" instead of ""Narakanta"" in the reference translation. ""Bail"" is a legal term that refers to the release of a person from custody, while ""Narakanta"" is the actual name of the character in the original Nepali text.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""went"") in the first sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""killed""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the second sentence, placing ""Norca"" before ""Ram Lakshman"" in the reference translation. This can make the sentence sound less natural and more awkward.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""फिर्ता ल्याए"" (phirta laiye) in the reference translation. This expression is commonly used in Nepali to indicate that someone has brought something back or returned something.
5. Names: The machine translation uses the name ""Ram Lakshman"" instead of ""Ram Laxman"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the accuracy of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original Nepali text as well as the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding, while the machine translation sounds less idiomatic and may be less understandable to native English speakers.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""novel's predecessor""

The machine translation uses the term ""predecessor,"" which is a more formal and technical term, while the reference translation uses ""preview of novels,"" which is a more informal and conversational term.

2. Tone:
	* Machine translation: ""seems that""
	* Reference translation: ""do not seem to be""

The machine translation uses a more formal tone, while the reference translation uses a more conversational tone.

3. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""it seems that""
	* Reference translation: ""do not seem to be""

The machine translation uses a more formal grammatical structure, while the reference translation uses a more conversational grammatical structure.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""full-fledged novels""
	* Reference translation: ""preview of novels""

The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""full-fledged novels,"" which may not be immediately understandable to non-native speakers. The reference translation uses a more idiomatic expression, ""preview of novels,"" which is more commonly used in Nepali.

5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""novel's predecessor""
	* Reference translation: ""preview of novels""

The machine translation does not take into account cultural references, while the reference translation does. The term ""novel's predecessor"" may not be immediately understandable to non-native speakers, as it is a more formal and technical term.

Overall, the reference translation is more idiomatic, culturally relevant, and conversational, while the machine translation is more formal and technical. Based on these differences, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

Step 1: Read the Source Text
I have read the source text, which is in Nepali: ""यस नक्षत्रको मुख्य ग्रह चन्द्रमा हो र हस्ता शब्दले हात अर्थको द्योतन गर्छ.""

Step 2: Compare with Machine Translation
I have compared the source text with the machine translation, which is: ""The main planet of this nervous system is the moon, and the deliberate word means the hand.""

Step 3: Identify Differences
There are several differences between the source text and the machine translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""nervous system"" instead of ""constellation"" in the source text.
2. Meaning: The machine translation translates ""चन्द्रमा"" as ""moon,"" which is different from the source text's ""नक्षत्र.""
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the source text, placing ""main planet"" before ""of this.""
4. Idiomatic expression: The machine translation uses the phrase ""deliberate word"" instead of the source text's ""हात अर्थको द्योतन.""

Step 4: Compare with Reference Translation
I have compared the machine translation with the reference translation, which is: ""The main planet of this constellation is the moon and the word hasta signifies hand.""

Step 5: Evaluate Quality
Based on the differences identified above, the quality of the machine translation is poor. The machine translation has made several errors in word choice, meaning, and word order, which can lead to confusion and miscommunication. In contrast, the reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali text.

Overall, the machine translation is not reliable for communication purposes and should be used with caution. It is important to rely on high-quality reference translations, such as the one provided in this case, to ensure accurate communication.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the words are rearranged to create a more awkward sentence structure. For example, in the machine translation, ""Each weekday morning"" is separated from ""was a question on the radio"" with a comma, which makes the sentence harder to read and understand. In the reference translation, the words are kept in their original order, which is more natural and easier to read.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is"") to describe the program, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Prepositions: In the machine translation, the preposition ""on"" is used to indicate the time of day, while in the reference translation, the preposition ""by"" is used. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
4. Word choice: In the machine translation, the word ""direct"" is used to describe the question, while in the reference translation, the word ""live"" is used. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the reference translation. For example, in the machine translation, the sentence is structured as a compound sentence with two independent clauses, while in the reference translation, the sentence is structured as a simple sentence with a single independent clause.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and easier to read, while the machine translation is more awkward and difficult to understand. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for any further translation work.

	* Machine translation: ""kathmandu kingdom""
	* Reference translation: ""Kathmandu state""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""Kathmandu kingdom"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Nepali, while the reference translation uses ""Kathmandu state"" which is a more common and idiomatic way to refer to the state of Kathmandu.
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""However, there was no war when he defeated the Kathmandu Kingdom, which was ruled by the kingdom of Jaipur.""
	* Reference translation: ""However, he did not have to wage war when winning the Kathmandu state that was being ruled by Jayprakash Malla.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure with two clauses, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with one main clause.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more common and idiomatic expressions, and the sentence structure is simpler and easier to understand. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses some words and phrases that are not commonly used in Nepali, and the sentence structure is more complex. Therefore, I would give a higher quality score to the reference translation.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Gandhi was again arrested"" is in the present tense, while the reference translation is in the past tense (""Gandhi was arrested again"").
	* Machine translation: The verb ""tried"" in the machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""tried to prevent"").
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the word ""absorbed"" to translate ""उनका अनुयायीहरूलाई उनीबाट पूर्णतया टाढा राखेर"" (the government tried to keep him completely away from his followers). The reference translation uses the word ""influenced"" to translate the same phrase.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""गान्धीजीद्वारा प्रभावित हुनबाट"" (to keep someone completely away from someone else's influence) in the reference translation.
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation is a simple sentence, while the reference translation is a compound sentence with two clauses.
5. Tone:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation has a more formal tone than the reference translation, which has a more conversational tone.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence better, including the idiomatic expression and the tone. The machine translation, on the other hand, simplifies the sentence structure and word choice, but loses some of the cultural and linguistic context.

	* Reference translation: ""Provision has been made under the Act for the registered beneficiaries to support each other financially and mentally."" (Correct use of ""are beneficial"" and ""to support"")
2. Word choice:

	* Reference translation: ""Provision has been made under the Act for the registered beneficiaries to support each other financially and mentally."" (Correct word choice)
3. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is awkward and difficult to understand.
	* Reference translation: The sentence structure is clear and easy to understand.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: "" registered under the act"" (Incorrect idiomatic expression, should be ""registered under the Act"")
	* Reference translation: ""Provision has been made under the Act for the registered beneficiaries to support each other financially and mentally."" (Correct idiomatic expression)
5. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: The translation does not take into account the cultural nuances of the Nepali language.
	* Reference translation: The translation takes into account the cultural nuances of the Nepali language.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, idiomatic, and culturally appropriate. The machine translation, on the other hand, contains several errors that can make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further communication or documentation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source Text: भगवान् विष्णुको मन्दिरमा एक दर्जनको सङ्ख्यामा केरा चढाउनु पर्छ (Bhagavan Vishnuko Mandirma aek darjanko sankhyaama keraa chhadaaunu parchha)
2. Machine Translation: In the temple of the goddess, a number of keras must be offered. (मachine translation)
3. Reference Translation: In the temple of the goddess, a dozens of bananas must be offered. (Reference translation)

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""number"" to translate ""दर्जन"" (darjanko), while the reference translation uses ""dozens"" to translate the same word.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""must be offered"" to translate ""केरा चढाउनु पर्छ"" (keraa chhadaaunu parchha), while the reference translation uses the present continuous tense ""must be offered"" to translate the same sentence.
3. Lexical choice: The machine translation uses the word ""keras"" to translate ""सङ्ख्यामा"" (sankhyaama), which is not a commonly used word in English. The reference translation uses the word ""bananas"" to translate ""सङ्ख्यामा"" (sankhyaama), which is a more common and accurate translation.

Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, and lexical choice. The machine translation uses less common and less accurate words, and the grammar is not as natural as the reference translation. Therefore, I would give a lower rating to the machine translation in this case.

Machine Translation:

* ""This was his disappointment that he would spend at least 15 minutes on the day.""

Reference Translation:

* ""He asked to spend at least 15 minutes a day in this way.""

Here are the differences I found between the two translations:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""disappointment"" to translate the Nepali word ""भन्ने"" (bhannē), while the reference translation uses ""asked"" to translate the same word.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""would spend"") to translate the Nepali sentence, while the reference translation uses the present continuous tense (""spend at least 15 minutes a day"").
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the Nepali sentence, placing ""on the day"" after ""disappointment"" instead of before it.
4. Idiomatic expression: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""in this way"" ( Nepali: ""उनको भनाइ"") used in the reference translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""spend"" in the infinitive form, while the reference translation uses the present participle ""spending"" to indicate the ongoing nature of the action.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the Nepali sentence. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Nepali language better, including the idiomatic expression and the correct verb tense. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

Machine Translation:

* ""In that game, triple h had adjusted to two victories"" - This sentence is grammatically correct, but the use of ""adjusted"" is not the most appropriate translation for the Nepali word ""समायोजन"" (samayojan). ""Adjusted"" means to make changes or adjustments to something, but in this context, it seems to imply that Triple H had adapted to the game. A more accurate translation for ""samayojan"" in this sentence would be ""adjusted"" or ""adapted"".
* ""losing to Ken"" - This part of the sentence is grammatically correct.

Reference Translation:

* ""In that game, Triple H had adjusted to two victories"" - This sentence is a more accurate translation of the Nepali sentence. The use of ""adjusted"" is more appropriate for the context of the sentence, as it implies that Triple H had adapted to the game and won two victories.
* ""losing to Ken"" - This part of the sentence is also grammatically correct.

Overall, the machine translation makes a few errors in the translation of the Nepali sentence. The use of ""adjusted"" instead of ""adapted"" for ""samayojan"" is the most significant difference between the two translations. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation for this sentence.

Machine Translation: ""For the sums, the beauty, and the sansaric happiness.""

* ""Sums"" is not a word in Nepali, so this phrase is incorrect. In Nepali, the word for ""material"" or ""worldly"" things is ""sansar.""
* ""Beauty"" is also not a word in Nepali, so this phrase is incorrect. In Nepali, the word for ""beauty"" is ""sundari.""
* ""Sansaric happiness"" is a bit of a strange phrase, and it's not a direct translation of the Nepali phrase ""sura."" In Nepali, ""sura"" refers to the worldly or material happiness that is considered obstacles for Yogis.

Reference Translation: ""Material happiness, beauty and sura are hurdles to Yogis.""

* This translation is more accurate, as it uses the correct Nepali words for ""material,"" ""beauty,"" and ""sura.""
* The phrase ""hurdles to Yogis"" is a more idiomatic way of expressing the idea that these things are obstacles for Yogis, as opposed to the machine translation's use of ""happiness.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""sampered"" instead of ""similarity"". This is a significant difference as ""sampered"" is not a word in English and does not convey the intended meaning of ""similarity"".
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence is in the past tense (""have been sampered"") whereas in the reference translation, it is in the present tense (""there is similarity"").
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use idiomatic expressions found in the reference translation. For example, the reference translation uses the phrase ""social values ​and beliefs"" which is a common idiomatic expression in English, but the machine translation does not use this phrase.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation is not accurate in conveying the meaning of the original Nepali sentence. The reference translation more accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence by using the phrase ""there is similarity"".

1. Gender roles: The machine translation uses the term ""him"" to refer to men, while the reference translation uses the term ""men"" to refer to the gender. This subtle difference in language choice reflects a more inclusive and gender-sensitive approach in the reference translation.
2. Ownership: The machine translation uses the phrase ""his goat"" to refer to a goat owned by a man, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""their goat"" to refer to a goat owned by both men and women. This change in language choice reflects a more equitable and inclusive view of ownership.
3. Caste and tribe: The machine translation uses the term ""caste"" to refer to the social hierarchy of Nepali society, while the reference translation uses the term ""caste and tribe."" This change in language choice reflects a more nuanced understanding of the complex social dynamics at play in Nepali society.
4. Tone: The machine translation has a more formal and distant tone, while the reference translation has a more conversational and empathetic tone. This difference in tone reflects a more engaging and respectful approach in the reference translation.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""seeing him as just a man's goat"" to convey the idea that women are seen as subordinate to men in some Nepali communities. While this phrase is idiomatic and culturally specific, it may not be immediately clear to non-Nepali speakers. The reference translation avoids this idiomatic expression and instead uses a more straightforward phrase to convey the same idea.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate, inclusive, and culturally sensitive than the machine translation. It avoids gendered language and stereotypes, and instead uses language that is respectful and inclusive of all genders. Additionally, it provides a more nuanced understanding of the complex social dynamics at play in Nepali society.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""woreda"" which is not a commonly used term in Nepali. In Nepali, ""Pachnaali"" is the more commonly used term for a habitation or a settlement.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""is"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""has"" in the present perfect tense.
3. Number agreement: The machine translation uses the indefinite article ""a"" before the number ""hundreds"" which is incorrect. In Nepali, the indefinite article ""a"" is used before singular nouns, not plural nouns.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""of the mallow family"" comes after the noun ""woreda"" which is not the correct word order in Nepali.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation ""mallow family"" is not accurate as ""mallu"" is not a Nepali word. In Nepali, ""Malla"" is the correct term for a family or a clan.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""suburb"" to translate ""समुदायको"" (samudayko), which is not a common word in Nepali. In Nepali, ""suburb"" refers to a residential area on the outskirts of a city, so it doesn't quite fit the context of the sentence. The reference translation uses the word ""colony"" which is a more appropriate word to translate ""समुदायको"" (samudayko).
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""goes on"" to translate ""कस्सीर कलान्तरमा"" (kassir kalaantarma), which is incorrect. The correct translation should be ""became"" or ""turned into"" to match the past tense of the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, which is incorrect. In Nepali, the word order is typically SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), so the sentence should read ""Even the suburb of Kassir community became Kashmir.""
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""kassir arts"" to translate ""काश्मिर"" (kashmir), which is not a common idiomatic expression in Nepali. In Nepali, ""kashmir"" is used to refer to a specific region in India, so it should be translated as ""Kashmir"" without the article ""the"".
5. Cultural context: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the sentence. ""Kassir"" is a colony of the Kass community, and ""Kashmir"" refers to a specific region in India with a unique culture and history.

	The machine translation uses the phrase ""third atonement"" which is not a common way to refer to a movie in Nepali. In Nepali, movies are typically referred to as ""mahotsav"" (महोत्सव) followed by the name of the movie. The reference translation uses this format to refer to the movie.
3. Sentence structure:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""He closed that in running the Indian Rupee Nepalese note as well.""
	* Reference translation: ""He stopped the use of Indian rupee that was circulating like a Nepali note.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the present participle ""running"" instead of the past tense ""stopped"" in the reference translation. This is a common error in machine translations, as they often struggle to capture the nuances of verb tenses and grammatical structures.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""भारतीय रुपियाँ"" (Indian rupee)
	* Reference translation: ""Indian rupee that was circulating like a Nepali note""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the direct translation of ""भारतीय रुपियाँ"" (Indian rupee) without any additional context or clarification. In contrast, the reference translation provides more context by using the phrase ""that was circulating like a Nepali note,"" which helps to clarify the meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""नेपाली नोट सरह चलिरहेकामा"" (He closed the Indian Rupee Nepalese note as well)
	* Reference translation: ""He stopped the use of Indian rupee that was circulating like a Nepali note""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""नेपाली नोट सरह चलिरहेकामा"" (He closed the Indian Rupee Nepalese note as well), which is not commonly used in English. In contrast, the reference translation uses a more straightforward and idiomatic expression, ""He stopped the use of Indian rupee that was circulating like a Nepali note.""
4. Cultural context:
	* Machine translation: ""भारतीय रुपियाँ"" (Indian rupee)
	* Reference translation: ""Indian rupee that was circulating like a Nepali note""
	* Difference: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the sentence, which is that the Indian rupee is not circulating in Nepal. In contrast, the reference translation acknowledges this cultural context by using the phrase ""that was circulating like a Nepali note.""

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation provides more context, uses more idiomatic expressions, and takes into account the cultural context of the sentence, making it a more reliable and high-quality translation.

	* Machine translation: ""Kuniz's family is Jewish"" - Incorrect use of apostrophe. It should be ""Kuniz's family is Jewish"" without an apostrophe.
	* Reference translation: ""Kuniz 's family is Jewish"" - Correct use of apostrophe.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""and according to him"" - Incorrect word choice. It should be ""and according to him"" instead of ""and according to him.""
	* Reference translation: ""and according to them"" - Correct word choice.
3. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""his family also became the cause of leaving the Soviet Union because of the harsh opposition of non - Jewish opponents"" - Incorrect sentence structure. It should be ""his family also became the cause of leaving the Soviet Union due to the harsh opposition of non-Jewish opponents"" instead.
	* Reference translation: ""non-jewish sentiment became the cause of leaving the Soviet Union"" - Correct sentence structure.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""harsh opposition of non - Jewish opponents"" - Incorrect idiomatic expression. It should be ""harsh opposition of non-Jewish people"" instead.
	* Reference translation: ""non-jewish sentiment"" - Correct idiomatic expression.
5. Cultural context:
	* Machine translation: ""Kuniz's family is Jewish"" - Incorrect cultural context. It should be ""Kuniz's Jewish family"" instead.
	* Reference translation: ""Kuniz 's Jewish family"" - Correct cultural context.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, word choice, sentence structure, and cultural context, which can affect the overall accuracy and fluency of the translation. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable source for Nepali-English translation.

Machine Translation:

* Incorrect word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""foxes"" instead of ""lungs"" in the reference translation.
* Grammar mistake: The machine translation uses the present tense ""are"" instead of the past tense ""were"" in the reference translation.
* Incorrect sentence structure: The machine translation puts the verb ""is"" in the wrong position in the sentence, making it difficult to understand.

Reference Translation:

* Correct word choice: The reference translation uses the correct word ""lungs"" instead of ""foxes"".
* Correct grammar: The reference translation uses the past tense ""were"" instead of the present tense ""are"".
* Improved sentence structure: The reference translation puts the verb ""were"" in the correct position in the sentence, making it easier to understand.

Overall, the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation uses correct grammar and word choice, and the sentence structure is improved, making it easier to understand.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""insa"" instead of ""Christ"" in the reference translation. ""Insa"" is not a commonly used term in Nepali, and it seems to be a mistake in the machine translation.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""managed"" in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past participle ""built"" in the sentence. This difference in verb tense may affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""for learning"" is placed after the verb ""managed,"" while in the reference translation, it is placed before the verb.
4. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include any punctuation after the word ""canals,"" while the reference translation includes a period after the word. This may affect the clarity and readability of the sentence.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation seems to have made some errors in the translation. For example, ""insa"" is not a recognized term in Nepali, and ""sumerians"" should be spelled ""Sumerians.""

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""hailing"" instead of ""hailstorm"" in the source sentence. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. In the reference translation, the word ""hailstorm"" is used, which is more accurate and precise.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""presents"") in the source sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""depicted""). This difference in tense can affect the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the painting is still present in the past, rather than being a representation of a past event.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the source sentence, placing ""its expected cold environment"" after ""hailing places"". In the reference translation, the word order is maintained, with ""its expected cold environment"" appearing before ""hailing places"". This difference in word order can affect the clarity and flow of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""a picture of its expected cold environment"" in the source sentence, while the reference translation does. This expression is more natural and idiomatic in Nepali, and it conveys the meaning of the sentence more accurately.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""present"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""depicts"" in the past tense. This difference in verb choice can affect the overall grammar of the sentence, and it may not be as clear or natural in Nepali.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural in Nepali than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more precise language and conveys the meaning of the sentence more clearly, while the machine translation has some minor errors and inaccuracies.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""nevertheless"" to indicate a contrast, while the reference translation uses ""however."" ""Nevertheless"" implies a stronger contrast, while ""however"" is more neutral.
2. Gendered language: The machine translation uses the word ""she"" to refer to Sabitra, which could be seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes. The reference translation uses the gender-neutral term ""her"" instead.
3. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is to be"") to indicate Sabitra's gender, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was""). This could be a result of the machine translation's difficulty in handling verb tenses.
4. Word order: The machine translation rearranges the word order of the original sentence, placing ""the sabitra's"" before ""football playing."" This can make the sentence harder to read and understand.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""to be able to stop"" in the reference translation. This could result in a less natural-sounding translation.

3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""Zita Merana day"" which is not found in the reference translation. This may indicate that the machine translation is not able to capture the nuances of Nepali idioms and expressions.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Maghe Sankranti"" as ""the previous day of the demolition"". Maghe Sankranti is a Nepali festival that falls on the 15th day of the Nepali month of Poush, and it is not related to demolition.

1. Source Text: त्यसैले उनलाई वैद्धिक कालमा मन्त्रद्रष्टा भनेर चिनिन्थ्यो (Tyasaila unlai vedic kaalmaa mantradrasta bhanera chinithyo)
2. Machine Translation: So he was known as a mechanic in the philosophical era.

Differences:

* The machine translation uses the term ""mechanic"" which is not an accurate representation of the original Nepali word ""मन्त्रद्रष्टा"" (mantradrasta). ""मन्त्र"" means ""mantra"" or ""incantation"", and ""द्रष्टा"" means ""seer"" or ""visionary"". So, the machine translation should have used ""mantra seer"" or ""visionary"" instead of ""mechanic"".
* The machine translation also changes the meaning of the sentence. The original Nepali sentence is saying that the person was known as a ""mantra seer"" in the Vedic period, while the machine translation is saying that he was known as a ""mechanic"" in the philosophical era.
3. Reference Translation: Therefore , he was known as a mantra seer in the Vedic period .

Comparison:

* The reference translation accurately represents the original Nepali word ""मन्त्रद्रष्टा"" (mantradrasta) as ""mantra seer"".
* The reference translation also maintains the original meaning of the sentence, which is that the person was known as a ""mantra seer"" in the Vedic period.

Conclusion:

Based on my analysis, the reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali text compared to the machine translation. The machine translation changes the meaning of the sentence and uses an inappropriate term to translate the Nepali word ""मन्त्रद्रष्टा"" (mantradrasta). Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable translation of the Nepali text.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""shakti"" (strength) in the original Nepali text, while the reference translation uses ""shakyat"" (potential). This subtle difference in word choice reflects a deeper difference in the way the translators understood the meaning of the original Nepali text.
2. Tone: The machine translation has a more formal and serious tone, while the reference translation has a more conversational and informal tone. This difference in tone may be due to the translators' interpretation of the intended audience and purpose of the text.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""open to the potential"" in the final sentence, while the reference translation uses ""many ways."" While both expressions convey the same meaning, the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Nepali.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""opens"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""opens up"" in the present tense. This difference in verb choice may be due to the translators' interpretation of the intended meaning of the original Nepali text.
5. Word order: The machine translation places the word ""limited"" before the word ""strength,"" while the reference translation places it after. This difference in word order may be due to the translators' interpretation of the most natural way to express the meaning of the original Nepali text.

Overall, while both translations are grammatically correct, the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Nepali. The machine translation, on the other hand, is more formal and serious in tone, and may not be as effective in conveying the intended meaning of the original text.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""people"" to refer to the entire group, while the reference translation uses ""Chhetri"" to refer to a specific ethnic group. This highlights a difference in terminology and understanding of the source language.
2. Gendered language: The machine translation uses the masculine pronoun ""they"" to refer to the group, while the reference translation uses the gender-neutral pronoun ""they"" to refer to the group. This is a minor difference, but it shows that the reference translation is more inclusive and sensitive to gender issues.
3. Surnames: The machine translation includes the surnames of the people mentioned in the source language, while the reference translation does not. This is a difference in translation strategy, as the machine translation is trying to provide more information, while the reference translation is focusing on the main idea of the sentence.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the source language, placing the verb ""live"" at the end of the sentence. The reference translation maintains the original word order of the source language. This difference highlights the challenge of translating Nepali into English, as the two languages have different grammatical structures.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation includes one ( ""Bhandari surname""). This highlights the challenge of translating cultural references and idiomatic expressions in a way that is both accurate and culturally appropriate.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation.

Step 1: Read the Source Text
I have read the source text, which is ""शतरुद्र संहितामा हनुमानलाई एकादश रुद्रमध्ये एघारौँ रूप हनुमानको मानिएको छ"" (In Satrudra, Hanuman is considered the eleventh of the akkadian rudras).

Step 2: Compare with Machine Translation
Now, let's compare the machine translation with the source text:

Machine Translation: ""In Satrudra, Hanuman is considered the eleventh of the akkadian rudras.""

Reference Translation: ""In the Shatrudra Samhita, Hanuman is considered to be the eleventh incarnation among ekadash rudra.""

Comparison:

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways:

1. Word Choice: The machine translation uses ""akkadian rudras"" instead of ""ekadash rudra"" in the reference translation. ""Akkadian"" is not a word commonly used in Nepali, and it is not clear what language is being referred to. In contrast, ""ekadash rudra"" is a Nepali phrase that means ""eleventh incarnation.""
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""is considered"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""was considered."" This change in verb tense affects the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include any punctuation after ""Hanuman"" in the sentence, while the reference translation includes a comma after ""Hanuman"" to separate the name from the rest of the sentence.

Step 3: Evaluate the Quality
Based on the differences I have identified, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as low. The machine translation has made several errors in word choice, grammar, and punctuation, which can affect the overall meaning and accuracy of the translation.

Recommendations:

To improve the quality of the translation, I would recommend the following:

1. Use Nepali-English dictionaries and glossaries to ensure accurate word choice and meaning.
2. Consult with native Nepali speakers to verify the grammar and punctuation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Sukati Village"" (मान वोगटान) is translated as ""Sukati Village, which lower wogatan intervened"" (उपल्लो वोगटान अन्तरगतपर्ने सुकाटी गाउँमा). The word choice in the machine translation is not accurate, as ""Sukati"" is a proper noun and should not be translated as a common noun.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation correctly translates ""Sukati"" as a proper noun, using the phrase ""Sukati Village"" (सुकाटी गाउँ).
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the present tense in the sentence, which is not appropriate for a historical event that occurred in the past. The sentence should be in the past tense.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the past tense correctly, as it is a historical event that occurred in the past.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not translate the idiomatic expression ""governed by the nobles of wadada"" (वडादशैको नवमीमा) correctly. The phrase ""wadada"" is not a commonly used term in Nepali, and it should be translated as ""noble men"" or ""noble leaders"" to convey the intended meaning.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation translates the idiomatic expression correctly, using the phrase ""noble men"" (नवमीमा).
4. Cultural context:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the sentence, which is important for conveying the correct meaning. The sentence refers to a historical event that occurred in Nepal, and the translation should reflect this cultural context.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation takes into account the cultural context of the sentence, using the phrase ""governed by the nobles of wadada"" (नवमीमा) to convey the idea that the village was governed by noble men, which is a common practice in Nepalese culture.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and culturally appropriate than the machine translation. The reference translation takes into account the historical context of the sentence, uses proper nouns, and translates idiomatic expressions correctly. The machine translation, on the other hand, makes several errors in word choice, grammar, and cultural context, which can lead to a loss of meaning and accuracy in the translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation uses the word ""found"" instead of ""taken"" in the second sentence, which is a minor error.
* The word ""sketch"" is translated as ""छापलाई"" in the machine translation, which is a bit awkward and not the most common way to translate ""sketch"" in Nepali. A more common translation would be ""चित्र"" or ""चित्रका"".

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation uses the word ""taken"" instead of ""found"" in the second sentence, which is the correct usage.
* The translation of ""sketch"" is accurate, as ""चित्र"" or ""चित्रका"" are both common ways to translate ""sketch"" in Nepali.

Overall, the machine translation makes a few minor errors in word choice and grammar, while the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding. However, both translations are still far from perfect, and a professional translator would likely make further improvements to the translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""melody"" to translate ""धार्मिक"" (dharmiik), which is not a very accurate choice. ""धार्मिक"" actually means ""religious"" or ""spiritual"", so a better translation would be ""a religious scene"" or ""a spiritual pool"".
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is"" to translate ""पोखरीमा"" (pokhari), which is incorrect. ""पोखरीमा"" is actually in the past tense, so a better translation would be ""held"" or ""was held"".
3. Word order: In the machine translation, the words ""great"" and ""considered"" are placed in the wrong position. A better translation would be ""a very important scene is held in the pool"".
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""जनै पूर्णिमाको दिन"" (janai purnima ko din), which means ""the day of Janai Purnima"". A better translation would be ""the day of the full moon of Janai"".
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the wrong verb form in the sentence ""which is considered to be very important"". A better translation would be ""which is considered very important"".

Overall, the machine translation is not very accurate and doesn't capture the nuances of the original Nepali sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and idiomatic.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given source:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""astrologer"" to translate ""अश्विनी नक्षत्रको"" (Ashwini Nakshatri), while the reference translation uses ""Ashwapurush"" to translate the same term. This suggests that the machine translation may not have fully captured the nuances of the Nepali language, as ""astrologer"" does not directly correspond to the meaning of ""Ashwapurush"" in Nepali.
2. Gender agreement: In the machine translation, the term ""goddess"" is used to translate ""देवता"" (Devatā), which is a feminine noun in Nepali. However, in the reference translation, the term ""god"" is used, which is masculine. This suggests that the machine translation may not have properly accounted for the gender agreement rules in Nepali.
3. Word formation: The machine translation forms the compound word ""Ashwini Nakshatri"" by combining ""Ashwini"" and ""Nakshatri"", while the reference translation forms the compound word ""Ashwapurush"" by combining ""Ashwapurush"" and ""Ashwinikumar"". This suggests that the machine translation may not have fully understood the compound word formation rules in Nepali.
4. Contextual understanding: The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the context of the sentence, as it translates ""अश्विनी नक्षत्रको"" (Ashwini Nakshatri) as ""astrologer and goddess of astrology"", while the reference translation translates it as ""Ashwapurush and god of Ashwinikumar"". This suggests that the machine translation may not have fully understood the context of the sentence.

Overall, it seems that the machine translation has made several errors in translating the Nepali sentence, particularly in terms of word choice, gender agreement, and contextual understanding. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and nuanced translation of the Nepali sentence.

4. Title capitalization: The machine translation capitalizes the word ""Title"" while the reference translation does not.
5. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include the comma after ""journey"" in the reference translation, while the reference translation does.
6. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""followed"" while the reference translation uses ""follows"".
7. Number agreement: The machine translation uses the singular form ""title"" while the reference translation uses the plural form ""titles"".
8. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is"" while the reference translation uses the past tense ""followed"".

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation has made some errors in word order, article usage, adjective placement, and tense agreement.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""As much as we mind survival and sadness"" - The sentence structure is awkward and unnatural in English. It should be ""As much as we mind survival and sadness.""
	* Reference translation: ""The more we meditate on good deeds and good thoughts"" - This sentence is grammatically correct in English.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""there is a growing approach to survival and sadness"" - The word ""approach"" is not commonly used to describe a feeling or emotion. It should be ""there is a growing awareness of survival and sadness.""
	* Reference translation: ""the more we have mental stability"" - The word ""mental stability"" is not a direct translation of the Nepali word ""मानसिक स्थिरता"" (manasik sthirata). A more accurate translation would be ""the more we have mental clarity"" or ""the more we are mentally clear.""
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""including mental stability"" - This phrase is not a direct translation of the Nepali phrase ""साथसाथै सत्कर्म तथा सद्विचारमा"" (sathasathai sankram tatha sadvicharma). A more accurate translation would be ""including mental well-being"" or ""including mental health.""
	* Reference translation: ""the more we have mental stability as well as a passion for good deeds and good thoughts"" - This sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the Nepali phrase, which emphasizes the importance of mental clarity and a passion for doing good deeds.
4. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: ""survival and sadness"" - The phrase ""survival and sadness"" is not a direct translation of the Nepali phrase ""सत्कर्म र सद्विचार"" (sankram ra sadvichar). A more accurate translation would be ""good deeds and good thoughts"" or ""positive actions and positive thoughts.""

This suggests that the machine translation may not have fully understood the tense of the original sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the verb ""work"" after the noun ""youth,"" while the reference translation puts it before the noun. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and flow of the sentence.
4. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a simple phrase structure (""Some educated youth work...""), while the reference translation uses a more complex phrase structure (""Some educated youths work...""). The reference translation also adds a prepositional phrase (""in village schools and some..."") to provide more context.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""nonprofit offices."" This suggests that the machine translation may not have fully understood the cultural and linguistic nuances of the original sentence.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""wrong"" to translate the Nepali word ""गल्ती"" (galti), which means ""mistake"" or ""error"". However, the reference translation uses the word ""mistake"" to preserve the original meaning of the Nepali sentence.
2. Connotation: The machine translation implies that the writers were intentionally making mistakes, which may not be the intended meaning of the original sentence. The reference translation avoids this connotation by using the phrase ""without mistake"".
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""as they knew the interest"" to translate the Nepali idiomatic expression ""जस्ताको त्यस्तै"" (jastaako tyasta). This phrase is not a direct translation of any English idiom, and the reference translation uses a more literal translation to preserve the original meaning.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""are"" to translate the Nepali verb ""गर्नु"" (garnu), which is in the present tense in Nepali. The reference translation uses the past tense ""could write"" to preserve the original tense of the Nepali sentence.

The reference translation uses a more formal and literal translation of the Nepali phrase, while the machine translation uses a more informal and conversational tone.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is the recipient of the guest"" in the second sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""got good fortune."" This difference in verb tense may be due to the machine translation's inability to accurately convey the nuances of Nepali grammar.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""like meat"" in the second sentence, which is not a direct translation of the Nepali phrase ""निचजातिका मान्छेलाई दान गर्दा."" The reference translation uses a more literal translation of the phrase, ""food such as meat and fish.""
4. Cultural context: The machine translation does not convey the cultural context of the original Nepali phrase.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""wrath"" to translate ""क्रोधित"" (krodhita), which is a more formal and literary term in Nepali. In everyday language, people might use the word ""anger"" or ""fury"" to translate ""क्रोधित"".
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""he heard"") to translate ""यस्तो विवरण सुनेर"" (yasto vivarana sunera), which is in the past tense in Nepali. This is a common error in machine translation, as the software may not be able to accurately detect the tense of the source language.
3. Gender: The machine translation uses the masculine form of the verb ""to curse"" (""he cursed"") to translate ""कुबेरले उसलाई स्त्रीवियोग र मृत्युलोकमा जन्म लिई कोढरोगग्रस्त हुने"" (Kuber got angry with such a description and cursed him to be separated from his wife and born on earth suffering leprosy). In Nepali, the verb ""to curse"" is gender-neutral, so the reference translation uses the gender-neutral form ""उसलाई"" (usalai) to translate ""he/she"".
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence to make it more grammatically correct in English. In Nepali, the word order is typically SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), but in English, it's more common to use SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""जन्म लिई कोढरोगग्रस्त हुने"" (born on earth suffering leprosy) in the reference translation. This is a common problem in machine translation, as the software may not be able to understand the cultural and linguistic nuances of the source language.

	* Reference translation: The sentence takes into account the cultural context of Nepal and the fact that the age of marriage is typically much higher than 17 years old.

Overall, the machine translation is of poor quality compared to the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, word choice, tense, and cultural context, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and culturally appropriate, making it a better choice for communication in Nepali-English translation.

Machine Translation:

* ""Although this novel is not psychoanalytic, his analysis of psychoanalysis has been used in only a few.""

Reference Translation:

* ""His analysis that this novel is not psychological but psychoanalysis is used, is also rational.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""psychoanalytic"" instead of ""psychological"".
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense (""has been used"") while the reference translation uses the present tense (""is used"").
3. Word order: The machine translation rearranges the words in the sentence, placing ""analysis of psychoanalysis"" after ""this novel"".
4. Idiomatic expression: The machine translation uses the phrase ""not psychoanalytic"" which may not be the most idiomatic way to express the idea in Nepali. The reference translation uses the phrase ""not psychological but psychoanalysis is used"" which is more idiomatic.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the meaning of the original sentence, as the novel is not actually psychoanalytic in nature.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or idiomatic as the reference translation. The reference translation better conveys the meaning of the original sentence and uses more appropriate language for a Nepali speaker.

7. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""dot"" to refer to the Doti kingdom, while the reference translation uses the word ""Doti.""
8. Accuracy: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Doti"" as ""dot,"" which is not a correct translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, spelling, punctuation, tense, grammar, and word choice. The reference translation provides a more accurate and nuanced translation of the original Nepali text.

Differences:

1. Word order: The machine translation uses a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the subject ""Ruma Mcmain"" comes before the verb ""said,"" whereas in the reference translation, the verb ""told"" comes before the subject ""Mcmain.""
2. Phrasing: The machine translation uses the phrase ""Over the next week"" to introduce the sentence, while the reference translation uses ""In next week 's RAW"" to introduce the sentence.
3. Names: The machine translation uses the name ""Donald Trump"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses ""डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प"" in the first instance and ""Donald Trump"" in the second instance.
4. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense in both instances, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the second instance.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""back from Donald Trump"" in the second instance.

Based on these differences, it appears that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the original Nepali sentence.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words are arranged in a more random order, whereas in the reference translation, the words are arranged in a more logical and grammatical order. For example, in the machine translation, ""Rajwar"" is placed after ""there"" instead of before it, and ""brother"" is placed after ""Rajwar"" instead of before it.
2. Use of articles: The machine translation uses different articles than the reference translation. For example, in the machine translation, ""the gods"" is translated as ""त्यहाँका"" (tyahankā), whereas in the reference translation, it is translated as ""the deities"". Similarly, ""the brother of Rajwar"" is translated as ""Rajwar 's brother"" in the machine translation, whereas in the reference translation, it is translated as ""Rajwar 's brother as Jhal"".
3. Use of possessive pronouns: The machine translation uses different possessive pronouns than the reference translation. For example, in the machine translation, ""Rajwar's brother"" is translated as ""Rajwar 's brother as Jhal"", whereas in the reference translation, it is translated as ""Rajwar 's brother as Jhal"".
4. Use of adjectives: The machine translation uses different adjectives than the reference translation. For example, in the machine translation, ""gods"" is translated as ""देवताहरु"" (devatāharu), whereas in the reference translation, it is translated as ""deities"".

  As a helpful assistant, I will evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation by analyzing the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

Step 1: Identify the differences in grammar and syntax

* Machine translation: ""Because the majority is also as a major controversial genre, it needs to be defined as a relative of the current.""
* Reference translation: ""Since the epic is also a contemporary genre, it is important to define it in relativity of the present.""

Comparison:

* The machine translation uses the word ""major"" twice, which is not necessary and can be confusing.
* The reference translation uses the word ""contemporary"" correctly, which is a more appropriate term to use in this context.

Step 2: Identify the differences in vocabulary and terminology

* Machine translation: ""महाकाव्य समसामयिक विधाका रूपमा पनि रहेको हुनाले""
* Reference translation: ""Since the epic is also a contemporary genre""

Comparison:

* The machine translation uses the term ""महाकाव्य"" which is the Nepali word for ""epic"", while the reference translation uses the term ""epic"" which is the English equivalent.
* The machine translation uses the term ""समसामयिक विधाका"" which is the Nepali word for ""contemporary genre"", while the reference translation uses the term ""contemporary genre"" which is a more common and widely accepted term in English.

Step 3: Identify the differences in idiomatic expressions and cultural references

* Machine translation: ""it needs to be defined as a relative of the current.""
* Reference translation: ""it is important to define it in relativity of the present.""

Comparison:

* The machine translation uses the phrase ""relative of the current"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in English.
* The reference translation uses the phrase ""in relativity of the present"" which is a more common and idiomatic expression in English that accurately conveys the meaning of the Nepali sentence.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation

Based on the differences identified above, the overall quality of the translation is moderate. While the machine translation captures some of the basic grammar and syntax of the Nepali sentence, it lacks accuracy in vocabulary, terminology, and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Nepali sentence.

Recommendation:

Based on the evaluation, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further editing and refinement. The reference translation provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Nepali sentence, which can help to improve the overall quality of the translation.

Machine Translation:

* ""A comparison of one of these sanctuaries has been said not to be with the academy.""

Reference Translation:

* ""It is said that even one of the holiest places cannot be compared to Ekadashi.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""academy"" which is not a common term in Nepali language. In the reference translation, the word ""Ekadashi"" is used, which is a specific term in Nepali language for a particular type of holy place.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""has been said"" in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""cannot be compared"" to convey a different meaning.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""not to be with"" which is not a common idiomatic expression in Nepali language. In contrast, the reference translation uses the phrase ""cannot be compared to"" which is a more common and idiomatic way to express the idea in Nepali.
4. Cultural context: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the sentence, which is a common criticism of machine translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the term ""Ekadashi"" which is a specific term in Nepali language that refers to a particular type of holy place, and is culturally relevant to the Nepali context.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or culturally relevant as the reference translation in this case. The reference translation provides a more nuanced and culturally appropriate translation of the sentence, while the machine translation falls short in conveying the intended meaning and context.

Machine Translation: ""The sharpest point is the largest after the tenure of the sharpest point.""

Reference Translation: ""Tihar is the one of the biggest festival after Dashain for Hindus.""

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is incorrect. It should be ""The sharpest point is the largest after the tenure of the sharpest point"" instead of ""The sharpest point is the largest after the tenure of the point.""
	* Reference translation: The sentence structure is correct.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: The word ""tenure"" is not commonly used in Nepali language. In Nepali, the word ""धर्मावलम्बी"" (Dharmavalambi) is used to refer to the sharpest point of a knife or any other object.
	* Reference translation: The word ""धर्मावलम्बी"" (Dharmavalambi) is used correctly in the reference translation.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: The phrase ""after the tenure of the sharpest point"" is not a common idiom or expression in Nepali language. In Nepali, the phrase ""after the sharpest point"" (धर्मावलम्बीहरुको दशैं) is used to refer to the festival of Tihar.
	* Reference translation: The phrase ""after the sharpest point"" is used correctly in the reference translation.
4. Cultural context:
	* Machine translation: The sentence does not convey the cultural context of the festival of Tihar, which is one of the most important festivals in Nepal.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation correctly conveys the cultural context of the festival of Tihar, which is a festival of lights and an important occasion for Hindus in Nepal.

Based on the above analysis, it is clear that the machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation. The machine translation uses incorrect grammar, vocabulary, and cultural context, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the standard for Nepali-English translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the machine translation for the given sentence. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source sentence: यद्यपि, उहाँको स्पाइरोमिटरले आयतन मात्र मापन गर्न सक्यो तर वायुप्रवाह मापन गर्न सकेन।
Machine translation: However, his spirometer could only measure rectangles but could not measure airflow.
Reference translation: However, his spirometer could only measure volume but could not measure airflow.

Difference 1: Word choice (rectangles vs. volume)
The machine translation uses the word ""rectangles"" instead of ""volume"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly. The word ""rectangles"" is not a common term in medical contexts, and it may not be immediately clear to a non-expert reader what it refers to. In contrast, ""volume"" is a more common term in medical contexts and is more accurate in this context.

Difference 2: Grammar (could not measure airflow vs. could not measure airflow)
The machine translation uses the phrase ""could not measure airflow"" in both the source sentence and the translation. However, the reference translation uses the phrase ""could not measure airflow"" in the source sentence and ""airflow"" in the translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the clarity and consistency of the translation.

Difference 3: Idiomatic expression (measure rectangles vs. measure volume)
The machine translation uses the phrase ""measure rectangles"" in the source sentence and ""measure volume"" in the translation. While both phrases are grammatically correct, the idiomatic expression used in the reference translation is more common and natural in this context.

Overall, the machine translation has some minor errors in word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expression. While these errors are not significant enough to change the overall meaning of the sentence, they can affect the clarity and naturalness of the translation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a score of 60% for this sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""tibetan clothing"" in the northern region, while the reference translation uses ""Tibetan-style clothing."" This subtle difference in word choice reflects a more nuanced understanding of the cultural context. The reference translation acknowledges that Tibetan-style clothing is not necessarily the same as Tibetan clothing, and that there may be variations in the style of clothing worn in different regions.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""हुन्छन्"" (huunchn) in the first sentence, which is a more informal and colloquial way of expressing the idea of ""being worn."" The reference translation uses the more formal and standard verb ""मिल्ने"" (milne) to convey the same idea. This difference in grammar reflects the level of formality and precision desired in the translation.
3. Cultural context: The machine translation does not provide any context for the term ""Tamangs,"" which is a term used to refer to a specific ethnic group in Nepal. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides additional context by mentioning that Tamangs are a group that lives in the southern region of Nepal. This additional context helps to clarify the meaning of the sentence and avoids any potential misunderstandings.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""लुगा हुन्छन्"" (luga hunchn), which is a more informal and colloquial way of expressing the idea of ""being worn."" The reference translation uses the more standard and formal expression ""लुगा लगाउँछन्"" (luga lagauunchn), which is a more precise and accurate way of conveying the same idea.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and precise than the machine translation in terms of word choice, grammar, cultural context, and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation provides additional context and clarifies the meaning of the sentence, making it a more reliable and trustworthy translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""shadows"" instead of ""students"" in the source text. This is a significant difference, as ""shadows"" doesn't accurately convey the meaning of the original Nepali word ""छात्रहरू"" (chhātrahāru).
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""are"" to describe the students' action, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""joined"" to indicate that the students had already established the Nepal Student Union.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""पनि नेपाल छात्र संघको स्थापना गरी"" (pani Nepāl chhātrapān sambhānā gārī) in the source text. This expression is commonly used in Nepali to refer to the establishment of the Nepal Student Union.
4. Sentence structure: The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text, making it more straightforward and simple. The reference translation maintains the original sentence structure, which is more complex and conveys more nuanced information.
5. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses the word ""establishing"" instead of ""setting up"" or ""founding"" to describe the students' action. While ""establishing"" is a valid word in English, it doesn't quite convey the same meaning as the original Nepali word ""स्थापना"" (sambhānā).

Overall, the machine translation falls short in accurately conveying the meaning and nuances of the original Nepali text. The reference translation, on the other hand, does a better job of capturing the complexity and subtleties of the source text.

4. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a different phrase structure in the second sentence, with ""over a period of 30 years"" appearing as a single unit. In the reference translation, the phrase is broken down into two parts: ""over a period of"" and ""30 years.""
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions in the two sentences, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""aged 65 and above"" in the second sentence.
6. Grammar: The machine translation has some grammatical errors in both sentences.

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""he produced"") instead of the past tense (""he lifted"") in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""first international professional cup"" instead of ""first international title cup"" in the reference translation. This is a difference in idiomatic expression, as ""international professional cup"" is not a common phrase used in English.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation makes a mistake in the word ""Portugal,"" which is spelled incorrectly as ""पोर्चुगलको"" in the machine translation. The correct spelling is ""Portugal.""

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and spelling. The reference translation is more precise and accurate in conveying the intended meaning of the Nepali sentence.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation.

Step 1: Read the Source Text
I have read the source text, which is in Nepali.

Step 2: Compare with Machine Translation
I have compared the machine translation with the source text. Here are the differences I found:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the source text. In the machine translation, ""According to the census of the tamangs"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the source text, it is placed after ""तामाङहरुको धारणा"".
2. ""Tamangs"" vs. ""tamangs"": The machine translation uses ""tamangs"" instead of ""तामाङहरु"" in the source text.
3. ""spoil"" vs. ""धारणा"": The machine translation uses ""spoil"" instead of ""धारणा"" in the source text.
4. ""grain"" vs. ""शिशु"": The machine translation uses ""grain"" instead of ""शिशु"" in the source text.
5. ""mistaken"" vs. ""मिष्टभाषी"": The machine translation uses ""mistaken"" instead of ""मिष्टभाषी"" in the source text.

Step 3: Compare with Reference Translation
I have compared the machine translation with the reference translation. Here are the differences I found:

1. Word order: The reference translation has a similar word order to the source text as the machine translation.
2. ""Tamangs"" vs. ""तामाङहरु"": The reference translation uses ""Tamangs"" instead of ""तामाङहरु"" in the source text.
3. ""spoil"" vs. ""धारणा"": The reference translation uses ""spoil"" instead of ""धारणा"" in the source text.
4. ""grain"" vs. ""शिशु"": The reference translation uses ""grain"" instead of ""शिशु"" in the source text.
5. ""mistaken"" vs. ""मिष्टभाषी"": The reference translation uses ""mistaken"" instead of ""मिष्टभाषी"" in the source text.

Conclusion:
Based on the differences I found, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has made several changes to the word order, vocabulary, and grammar of the source text, which has resulted in a less accurate translation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating compared to the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Ratsih's three successors were"" should be ""Ratan Singh's three sons were"" (subject-verb agreement)
	* Reference translation: Correct
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Kalusih Bomb"" should be ""Kalu Singh Bam"" (correct spelling of the name)
	* Reference translation: Correct
	* Machine translation: ""moonvan bomb"" should be ""Moonvan Bam"" (correct spelling of the name)
	* Reference translation: Incorrect (there is no such name as ""moonvan bomb"")
	* Machine translation: ""nonbahadur bomb"" should be ""Nain Bahadur Bam"" (correct spelling of the name)
	* Reference translation: Correct
3. Phrasing:
	* Machine translation: ""Ratsih's three successors were"" is a bit awkward and wordy, while ""Ratan Singh's three sons were"" is more natural and concise
	* Reference translation: Correct
4. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Kalu Singh Bam"" is not a common phrase in Nepali, it should be ""Kalu Singh"" (omitting the article ""the"" is more common in Nepali)
	* Reference translation: Correct
5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""bomb"" is a term that is not commonly used in Nepali, it should be ""bam"" (the correct term for a bomb in Nepali)
	* Reference translation: Correct

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, vocabulary, and phrasing, which can affect the overall quality of the translation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating than the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""As the damned gan rises"" - This sentence is grammatically incorrect. ""Dammed"" should be ""damned"".
	* Reference translation: ""As the spiritual knowledge increases in Human"" - This sentence is grammatically correct.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""proportion of his positive gan rises"" - This sentence uses the word ""proportion"" incorrectly. The correct word in this context is ""spiritual"".
	* Reference translation: ""positivity also increases in the same proportion"" - This sentence uses the correct vocabulary in this context.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""As the damned gan rises"" - This is an idiomatic expression in Nepali, but the machine translation does not capture its nuance.
	* Reference translation: ""As the spritual knowledge increases in Human"" - This is a more accurate translation of the idiomatic expression in Nepali.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""damned"" has a negative connotation in English, which may not be the intended meaning in the original Nepali text.
	* Reference translation: ""spiritual knowledge"" is a more accurate translation of the Nepali term ""gan"" in this context, as it refers to a deeper understanding of the spiritual nature of humanity.
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The sentence structure and word choice do not convey the same level of fluency and naturalness as the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation falls short in capturing the nuances of the original Nepali text, particularly in terms of vocabulary, idioms, and cultural references. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and natural-sounding translation that preserves the meaning and intent of the original text.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""income"" multiple times, while the reference translation uses the word ""earn"" once. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout, while the reference translation uses the past tense. This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame in which the action is taking place.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""cash was income"" before ""and the cash was marketed in all places."" In the reference translation, the word order is maintained, with ""and the cash was income"" appearing after ""He used to earn cash.""
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""there was no market for ghee everywhere."" This difference can affect the naturalness and fluency of the translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""was"" in the present tense throughout, while the reference translation uses the verb ""used to"" in the past tense. This difference can affect the overall grammar of the sentence.

Based on these differences, it seems that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation maintains the original word order, uses the correct tense, and includes idiomatic expressions that are more natural and fluent. The machine translation, on the other hand, makes some significant changes to the word choice, tense, and word order, which can affect the overall meaning and naturalness of the translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Mr. Sutherland also listened to the bottom of a pedestal, and the eight guys, and the arrows of a hunter, for his God's GOD's sake.""
	* Reference translation: ""Seeing this, Lord Krishna also sat down meditating under a tree and a hunter's arrow hit him at his feet, causing him to go to his Paramdham Gaman.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense in several places, which can make the sentence confusing to read. For example, ""listened"" should be in the past tense to match the context, and ""hit"" should be in the past tense as well. The reference translation correctly uses the past tense in all instances.
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Mr. Sutherland also listened to the bottom of a pedestal, and the eight guys, and the arrows of a hunter, for his God's GOD's sake.""
	* Reference translation: ""Seeing this, Lord Krishna also sat down meditating under a tree and a hunter's arrow hit him at his feet, causing him to go to his Paramdham Gaman.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses some words that are not commonly used in Nepali, such as ""pedestal"" and ""GOD's sake."" The reference translation uses more appropriate and commonly used Nepali words, such as ""tree"" and "" Paramdham Gaman.""
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Mr. Sutherland also listened to the bottom of a pedestal, and the eight guys, and the arrows of a hunter, for his God's GOD's sake.""
	* Reference translation: ""Seeing this, Lord Krishna also sat down meditating under a tree and a hunter's arrow hit him at his feet, causing him to go to his Paramdham Gaman.""
	* Difference: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the original Nepali sentence. For example, "" Paramdham Gaman"" is an idiomatic expression used to describe the act of going to one's final destination or home, which is not conveyed in the machine translation.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""Mr. Sutherland also listened to the bottom of a pedestal, and the eight guys, and the arrows of a hunter, for his God's GOD's sake.""
	* Reference translation: ""Seeing this, Lord Krishna also sat down meditating under a tree and a hunter's arrow hit him at his feet, causing him to go to his Paramdham Gaman.""
	* Difference: The machine translation does not capture the cultural references used in the original Nepali sentence. For example, the reference to ""Paramdham Gaman"" is a cultural reference that is specific to Nepali culture and religion, and is not conveyed in the machine translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not accurate or fluent enough to convey the meaning and cultural context of the original Nepali sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and culturally appropriate translation of the sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""attacks"" (घाइते)
	* Reference translation: ""it attacks"" (आक्रमण गर्छ)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb ""attacks"" (घाइते), which is a more general term that can refer to any type of attack. The reference translation uses the verb ""it attacks"" (आक्रमण गर्छ), which is a more specific term that refers to the subject (it) attacking in self-defense.
2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""after being wounded"" (चलाउने वा प्रत्यक्ष सम्पर्कमा)
	* Reference translation: ""when it is injured"" (प्रतिरक्षाका लागि)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is wounded"" (चलाउने), while the reference translation uses the past tense ""was injured"" (प्रतिरक्षाका लागि). This difference may not have a significant impact on the overall meaning of the sentence, but it can affect the nuance of the translation.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""direct contact"" (प्रत्यक्ष सम्पर्कमा)
	* Reference translation: ""direct contact or teased"" (प्रतिरक्षाका लागि आक्रमण गर्छ)
	* Difference: The machine translation places the word ""direct contact"" (प्रत्यक्ष सम्पर्कमा) at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation places it earlier in the sentence along with ""teased"" (आक्रमण गर्छ). This difference may affect the emphasis of the sentence, with the machine translation placing more emphasis on the direct contact itself, while the reference translation placing more emphasis on the fact that the subject attacks in self-defense regardless of the circumstances.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""runaway"" (चलाउने)
	* Reference translation: ""when it is injured or teased"" (प्रतिरक्षाका लागि)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""runaway"" (चलाउने), which is not a common idiomatic expression in Nepali. The reference translation uses the more common idiomatic expression ""when it is injured or teased"" (प्रतिरक्षाका लागि), which is more natural and idiomatic in Nepali.

Overall, the machine translation has some errors in word choice, tense, word order, and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic in Nepali. Therefore, I would give a lower rating to the machine translation in this case.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""ready"" instead of ""aim"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. In the context of the sentence, ""aim"" implies a more specific and deliberate goal, while ""ready"" can imply a more general state of preparedness.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is said"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was said""). This difference in tense can affect the way the sentence is interpreted, as the past tense implies that the event has already occurred, while the present tense implies that it is ongoing or still true.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence slightly, placing ""if not"" at the beginning of the sentence instead of after ""this"". This can affect the emphasis and flow of the sentence, with the machine translation placing more emphasis on the condition (""if not"") and the reference translation placing more emphasis on the main clause (""his aim was to be ready"").
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""face the non-cooperation movement"" in the reference translation. This is a common idiomatic expression in Nepali that is used to describe the act of participating in a political movement or protest.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""to be"" in the present participle form (""be ready"") while the reference translation uses the verb ""to face"" in the infinitive form (""face the non-cooperation movement""). This difference in verb form can affect the way the sentence is structured and the emphasis it places on different elements of the sentence.

Overall, the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are relatively minor, but they can affect the way the sentence is interpreted and the meaning it conveys. The reference translation is generally more accurate and idiomatic, while the machine translation is more straightforward and literal.

Machine Translation: ""The victim wanders from the roof, and kills her.""

* The machine translation uses the word ""wanders"" instead of ""attacked"" to describe Bhima's action. This is a significant difference as ""wanders"" implies a more casual or random movement, whereas ""attacked"" conveys a more deliberate and aggressive action.
* The machine translation also uses the word ""her"" instead of ""him"" to refer to the person killed. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""series"" instead of ""books"" in the original Nepali text. This is a common error in machine translations, as they often struggle to accurately translate Nepali words that have multiple meanings or nuances.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""he needs to become"") in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""he became""). This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""series"" before ""devotion and nationality"" instead of after it. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less clear.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not accurately translate some idiomatic expressions in the original Nepali text. For example, the phrase ""श्रृङ्गारिक कविताका चाहिँ"" is not easily translatable, and the machine translation does not capture its nuance.
5. Grammar: The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the verb ""to become"" in the present tense.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the machine translation for the given source text. Here's my analysis step by step:

1. Grammar and syntax:
The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as "" Similar to the 2075 celebration"" instead of ""Similarly, the new building of this temple was inaugurated"" in the reference translation.
2. Vocabulary:
The machine translation uses simpler vocabulary than the reference translation. For example, it uses ""programme"" instead of ""program"" in the reference translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation struggles to capture the idiomatic expressions used in the source text. For instance, ""एक कार्यक्रम बिच नयाँ भवनको उद्घाटन गरिएको थियो"" in the source text is not accurately translated as ""a special occasion was held between a programme of new buildings of this temple"" in the machine translation.
4. Cultural references:
The machine translation may not capture the cultural nuances and references in the source text. For example, the reference translation includes ""Chaite Dashain"" which is a Nepali festival, while the machine translation does not include any cultural references.
5. Fluency:
The machine translation may not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. For instance, the machine translation uses ""between a programme of new buildings"" instead of ""inaugurated in a program organised on the occasion of"" in the reference translation.

Based on these analyses, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation lacks the nuances and cultural references present in the source text, and the grammar and syntax are not as fluent.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""event"" instead of ""incident"" in the reference translation. While both words can be used interchangeably, ""incident"" is a more common term in English to refer to a sudden, unexpected occurrence.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""was"" to describe the attack, while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense ""has been"" to indicate that the attack occurred in 2007 and its impact is still being felt.
3. Precision: The machine translation uses the phrase ""most dangerous terrorist attack"" to describe the incident, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""most dangerous terrorist attack in Pakistan's history"" to provide more context and emphasis.
4. Clarity: The machine translation is less clear than the reference translation in conveying the exact nature of the attack. The reference translation specifically mentions ""Karachi bombings"" to provide context and help the reader understand the nature of the attack.
5. Fluency: The machine translation has some awkward phrasing, such as ""after the karachi bombings in 2007"" which is less fluent than the reference translation.
6. Grammar: The machine translation has a grammatical error in the sentence ""This event is the most dangerous terrorist attack after the karachi bombings in 2007"" as ""event"" is not a noun and cannot be used in this context.
7. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use idiomatic expressions found in the reference translation, such as ""most dangerous terrorist attack in Pakistan's history"" which is a common idiomatic expression used to convey the severity of the incident.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate, clear, and fluent than the machine translation. The reference translation provides more context and uses more appropriate language to convey the nature of the incident, making it a better translation of the original Nepali text.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the words ""There are"" are placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, they are placed at the end. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations tend to prioritize word order consistency in the source language, while human translators may choose to place words in a more natural or idiomatic order in the target language.
2. Article usage: In the machine translation, the word ""a"" is used before ""grant"" to indicate that it is a specific grant, while in the reference translation, no article is used. This is because in Nepali, the article ""a"" is often omitted when the noun is clear from the context, as in this case.
3. Tense consistency: In the machine translation, the verb ""constructed"" is in the past tense, while in the reference translation, it is in the present tense. This is because machine translations may not always capture the nuances of verb tense and mood, especially when the source language has a complex tense system.
4. Word choice: In the machine translation, the word ""bow"" is used to translate the Nepali word ""धनुष,"" which can also mean ""arrow."" In the reference translation, the word ""chandrodaya"" is used, which is a more common term for a book of verses in Nepali. This difference highlights the importance of cultural knowledge and contextual understanding in translation.
5. Grammar: In the machine translation, the sentence structure is simpler, with a subject-verb-object word order. In the reference translation, the sentence structure is more complex, with a subject-object-verb word order. This difference reflects the complexity of the Nepali language, which has a rich grammatical system.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation differ in several aspects, including word order, article usage, tense consistency, word choice, and grammar. While machine translations can be useful for getting the general meaning of a text, they often lack the nuance and cultural context that human translators can provide.

Machine Translation: ""Restorations and amount of deficiency also taken by style science as a positive feature""

* The word ""restorations"" is not a correct translation of the Nepali word ""पुनरुक्तिहरू"" (punarukthiharu). The correct translation for this word is ""repetitions.""
* The phrase ""amount of deficiency"" is not a correct translation of the Nepali phrase ""मात्रागत विचलनलाई"" (matra gata vichalnalai). The correct translation for this phrase is ""quantitative deviations.""
* The word ""positive feature"" is not a direct translation of the Nepali word ""शैली विज्ञानले"" (shaili vijnanale). The correct translation for this word is ""stylistic features.""

Reference Translation: ""Repetitions and quantitative deviations are also taken as positive features by stylistics""

* The translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali text.
* The word ""repetitions"" is the correct translation of the Nepali word ""पुनरुक्तिहरू"" (punarukthiharu).
* The phrase ""quantitative deviations"" is the correct translation of the Nepali phrase ""मात्रागत विचलनलाई"" (matra gata vichalnalai).
* The word ""positive features"" is a more accurate translation of the Nepali word ""शैली विज्ञानले"" (shaili vijnanale).

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Nepali text than the machine translation. The machine translation makes several errors in the translation of key words and phrases, which can affect the overall meaning and accuracy of the translation.

Machine Translation:

* ""A Nimbat regularly burns never to gumba.""

Reference Translation:

* ""A never-ending candle burns regularly in the monastery.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""Nimbat"" instead of ""candle"" in the reference translation.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""burns"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""burned"").
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the subject ""Nimbat"" is in the nominative case, while in the reference translation, the subject ""candle"" is in the accusative case.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""never-ending candle"" used in the reference translation.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the sentence, which refers to a specific religious practice in Nepal.

Overall, the machine translation falls short in accurately conveying the meaning and cultural context of the original sentence. The reference translation provides a more accurate and culturally relevant translation of the sentence.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the subject ""The marriage of the sixth Shivaji Maharaj"" comes first, followed by the verb ""was held,"" while in the reference translation, the subject ""Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj"" comes first, followed by the verb ""was married.""
2. Use of articles: The machine translation uses the article ""the"" before ""sixth Shivaji Maharaj,"" while the reference translation does not use any article.
3. Spelling: The machine translation has a different spelling for the name ""Siwai"" than the reference translation, which spells it as ""Saiwai.""
4. Date: The machine translation has a different date than the reference translation. The machine translation gives the date as ""14 May 1640,"" while the reference translation gives the date as ""14 May 1640.""
5. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""was held"" to describe the marriage, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""was married.""
6. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""following"" to describe the bride, while the reference translation uses the word ""Nimbaler.""
7. Grammar: The machine translation has a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a passive voice construction, while the reference translation uses an active voice construction.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, spelling, date, tense, and word choice. However, it's worth noting that machine translation can be a useful tool for getting a general idea of the meaning of a text, but it may not always produce accurate translations, especially for complex or nuanced texts.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""aaphne"" instead of ""his own company"" in the reference translation. ""Aaphne"" is not a commonly used word in Nepali, and it seems to be a mistake in the machine translation.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""began broadcasting"") in both sentences, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""began broadcasting in his competitor's area"") to indicate that the action of broadcasting had already taken place.
3. Word order: In the machine translation, the word order is different than in the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""Hulk Hogan"" comes before ""in aaphne company,"" while in the reference translation, it comes after.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""in his competitor's area"" in the reference translation. This is a common expression used in Nepali to indicate the location or territory of a competitor.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""illustrated"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense verb ""admitted.""

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Nevertheless neither the maiden nor the maiden stopped being agreed between the companies."" (Incorrect use of ""nevertheless"" - it should be ""nevertheless"" instead of ""never the less"")
	* Reference translation: ""Neither the civil war ended not the political parties sat down for settlement."" (Correct use of ""neither...nor"" and ""not"" in the correct places)
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""maiden"" (Incorrect - the correct word in Nepali is ""janmadh"" or ""janmi"")
	* Reference translation: ""civil war"" (Incorrect - the correct term in Nepali is ""janjagatik ko yuddha"")
3. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The sentence is structured differently than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a compound sentence with two independent clauses, while the reference translation uses a simple sentence with a main clause and a subordinate clause.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""sat down for settlement"" (Incorrect - the correct idiomatic expression in Nepali is ""sat down for dialogue"" or ""sat down for talks"")
5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the sentence, which is important in Nepali language. The phrase ""janjagatik ko yuddha"" specifically refers to the civil war in Nepal, which is a sensitive topic in the country.

Overall, the machine translation is of poor quality compared to the reference translation. The machine translation makes several grammatical errors, uses incorrect word choices, and fails to capture the cultural context of the sentence. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and culturally appropriate translation of the Nepali sentence.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Improvements in administration initiated""
	* Reference translation: ""Trend like establishment of Public Service Commision""

The machine translation uses the word ""improvements"" to indicate a general enhancement or betterment, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""trend like"" to convey a more specific and consistent pattern.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""such as the establishment of a population service commission and swat judiciary""
	* Reference translation: ""after reforms in administration and independent judiciary""

The machine translation uses a subordinate clause to list two specific examples of improvements, while the reference translation uses a more concise and straightforward sentence structure to convey the same idea.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""सुधार गरी"" (suudhar garne)
	* Reference translation: ""Public Service Commision""

The machine translation uses a Nepali idiomatic expression ""सुधार गरी"" (suudhar garne), which means ""establishment"" or ""formation,"" while the reference translation uses the more formal and standardized term ""Public Service Commision.""

4. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: ""लोक सेवा आयोग र स्वातन्त्र न्यापालिकाको स्थापना""
	* Reference translation: ""the establishment of a Public Service Commision and independent judiciary""

The machine translation seems to struggle with the sentence structure and word choice, resulting in a less fluent and less natural-sounding translation compared to the reference translation.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""जुन ठाउँको"" (jun thaunko)
	* Reference translation: ""Banni""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""jun"" (water) instead of ""Banni"" (a place name) in the reference translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""which is bestowed upon it""
	* Reference translation: ""saying that the place where the weight of water and soil is equal, is the best""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a more literal translation of the Nepali phrase ""उत्तम हुन्छ"" (utram hunchha), which means ""equal weight,"" whereas the reference translation uses a more idiomatic expression ""saying that the place where the weight of water and soil is equal, is the best.""
4. Sentence structure:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""यसले भण्डारन मूल्य बढाउँछ"" (This increases the repository price) is in the present tense, which is correct. However, the verb ""रूपमै"" (it is) is in the wrong tense. It should be in the present tense as well.

2. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the word ""मूल्य"" (price) instead of ""रूपमै"" (value). While ""मूल्य"" can mean ""price"" in some contexts, it is not the most appropriate word to use in this sentence.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the word ""रूपमै"" (value) correctly.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not translate the idiomatic expression ""यसले भण्डारन"" (This increases) correctly. The correct translation of this expression is ""यो बढाउनुभ्यो"" (It increases).
	* Reference translation: The reference translation translates the idiomatic expression correctly as ""यो बढाउनुभ्यो"" (It increases).
4. Cultural and contextual nuances:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural and contextual nuances of the sentence. For example, the phrase ""यसले भण्डारन"" (This increases) is a common idiomatic expression in Nepali that is used to indicate that something is becoming more expensive or valuable.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation captures the cultural and contextual nuances of the sentence by using the phrase ""यो बढाउनुभ्यो"" (It increases), which is a more accurate translation of the original Nepali sentence.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of grammar, vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, and cultural and contextual nuances. While the machine translation is mostly correct in terms of grammar and syntax, it falls short in terms of word choice, idiomatic expressions, and cultural and contextual nuances.

3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""match the special guest"" which is not commonly used in Nepali language. In contrast, the reference translation uses a more common idiomatic expression ""obtain special auspicious results"".
4. Cultural context: The machine translation seems to be using a more literal translation of the Nepali sentence, without taking into account the cultural context of the phrase ""Rahu"". In Hindu mythology, Rahu is considered a malevolent planet, and the phrase ""position of Rahu"" is often used to describe a difficult or challenging situation.

* ""Celebrated"" is not a correct translation of the Nepali verb ""तशरीक"" (tasharik) as it does not convey the same meaning in English. In Nepali, ""तशरीक"" means ""to prepare"" or ""to make ready"".

Reference Translation:

* ""Last three days"" is a more accurate translation of the Nepali phrase ""तेल्छ तीन दिन"" as it conveys the idea that the event or activity took place over a specific period of time.
* ""Jilhij"" is a correct translation of the Nepali word ""जिलहिज"" as it means ""date"" or ""time"" in English.
* ""Tasharik"" is a correct translation of the Nepali verb ""तशरीक"" as it means ""to prepare"" or ""to make ready"" in English.

Based on my analysis, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Nepali language better and conveys the intended meaning more clearly in English.

756	"<s>[INST]<<SYS>>You are a helpful assistant.<</SYS>>A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: In the machine translation, the word ""smell"" is used, while in the reference translation, the word ""smell of fat"" is used. This suggests that the reference translation is more accurate in terms of capturing the nuances of the original Nepali sentence.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in both clauses, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the second clause. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""smell of fat"" which is commonly used in Nepali. This is a significant difference, as the idiomatic expression is an important aspect of Nepali language and culture.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""the smell of the spark"" comes after the verb ""is coming,"" while in the reference translation, it comes before the verb. This difference in word order can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
5. Cultural references: The reference translation uses the term ""grain"" instead of ""corn,"" which is the more commonly used term in Nepali. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the accuracy of the translation.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic compared to the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Nepali sentence better, including the use of idiomatic expressions and cultural references. The machine translation, on the other hand, makes some significant errors in word choice, grammar, and word order. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable translation of the Nepali sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""मेजर"" (majer) instead of ""महाजनर"" (mahajanar) to translate ""major"". This is a common mistake in machine translations, as they often struggle to accurately translate Nepali words with complex meanings.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense (""grew up"") to translate ""सन् १९८८मा"" (1988), while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense (""was promoted to"") to translate the same sentence. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Name spelling: The machine translation spells the name of the general as ""Rodrigues Ochoa"", while the reference translation spells it as ""Rodrigej Ochao"". This is a more significant difference, as the name of the general is an important detail in the sentence.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence to make it more grammatically correct in English. The reference translation places the verb ""began"" before the subject ""General Rodrigej Ochao"", while the machine translation places it after the subject.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not accurately translate the idiomatic expression ""एक उच्च पदमा"" (ek unchha padma), which means ""a high position"". The reference translation uses the more common English idiom ""higher position"".
6. Grammar: The machine translation uses the incorrect form of the verb ""appoint"" in the sentence. It should be ""appointed"" instead of ""appoint"".

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, tense, name spelling, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. However, it is important to note that machine translations are improving rapidly, and this may not be a significant difference in the future.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""waved"" to translate ""नाच"" (naach), which is a more casual and informal way of saying ""dance"". In contrast, the reference translation uses ""get excited"" to translate ""भएर बसेकाहरू"" (bhare basekaharu), which is a more formal and literary way of saying ""those fed up with"".
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is waved"" to translate ""नाच आरम्भ गर्ने"" (naach aarambh garne), which should be in the past tense to match the context of the sentence. The reference translation uses the past tense ""got excited"" to translate ""भएर बसेकाहरू"" (bhare basekaharu).
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""initiate"" to translate ""आरम्भ गर्ने"" (arambh garne), which is a more formal and literary way of saying ""beginning"". In contrast, the reference translation uses the verb ""start"" to translate ""आरम्भ गर्ने"" (arambh garne), which is a more informal and conversational way of saying ""beginning"".
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""waved again"" to translate ""नाच आरम्भ गर्ने"" (naach aarambh garne), which is not a common or idiomatic way of saying ""dance begins"". In contrast, the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""get excited"" to translate ""भएर बसेकाहरू"" (bhare basekaharu), which is a more common and idiomatic way of saying ""those fed up with"".

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation in this case. The machine translation uses more formal language and idiomatic expressions that are not commonly used in everyday conversation, while the reference translation uses more informal language and idiomatic expressions that are more commonly used in spoken Nepali.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word "" flagship"" to describe Ukraine, while the reference translation uses the word ""dress"" to describe the singer's outfit. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is seen"") to describe the singer's appearance in the video, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was seen""). This difference in verb tense is not significant, but it can affect the overall flow of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""a bike rider also appears"" to describe the singer's appearance in the video, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""the singer is seen wearing a dress that resembles the flag of Ukraine."" This difference in phrasing can affect the overall meaning and nuance of the sentence.
4. Cultural references: The machine translation does not include any cultural references, while the reference translation includes a reference to Ukraine's flag. This difference can affect the overall meaning and context of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. While the differences are minor, they can affect the overall quality and accuracy of the translation. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher rating than the machine translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation:

* ""Bajrang and bajhang are the same as starakshur and dhupre / Dadhimast.""

Reference Translation:

* ""As Bajrang and Bajhang are the same, Taraksur and Khapare / Dademasht are the same.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""starakshur"" and ""dhupre"" instead of ""Taraksur"" and ""Khapare"" in the reference translation.
2. Phrase structure: The machine translation separates the two phrases with a comma, while the reference translation uses a conjunction to connect them.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the second phrase, with ""Bajhang"" coming before ""Dadhimast"" in the machine translation, while it is the other way around in the reference translation.
4. Accent marks: The machine translation does not include the accent marks in the Nepali words, while the reference translation does.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, phrase structure, word order, and accent marks. The reference translation provides a more faithful representation of the original Nepali sentence.
