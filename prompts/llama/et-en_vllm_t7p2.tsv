  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Neid viimaseid asju ei pruugi mõistuspärane toimija soovida"" becomes ""These last things may not be wanted by a rational player"" in the machine translation. The sentence structure is slightly different, with the verb ""to be"" moved to the end of the sentence in the machine translation.
	* Reference translation: ""Õieti ei tohi soovida"" keeps the original Estonian sentence structure, with the verb ""to be"" in the second position.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the phrase ""rational player"" instead of ""rational actor"" in the reference translation. While ""player"" is a common term in English for a person who participates in a game or activity, it may not be the most appropriate term in this context, as it could imply a more casual or recreational approach to decision-making.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the term ""rational wish-maker"" instead of ""rational player"". This term better captures the idea of a person who makes decisions based on reason and logic, rather than emotions or whims.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the phrase ""in order to be a rational wish"" in the final sentence, while the reference translation uses ""in order to make a rational wish"". The reference translation is more idiomatic in English, as ""make a wish"" is a common phrase used to express the idea of expressing a desire or hope.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not include any cultural references or nuances that may be specific to Estonian or European culture. The reference translation, on the other hand, includes a cultural reference to ""mõistuspärane"", which is a term used in Estonian to refer to a person who is skilled in making decisions or solving problems.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic in English compared to the machine translation. While the machine translation is grammatically correct, it lacks the cultural nuances and word choices that are specific to the Estonian language and culture. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for any further communication or translation needs.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""It is important to decide what a difference there is between what he has done and the actions that show us the gravity of the murder."" (incorrect use of ""what"" and ""actions"")
	* Reference translation: ""It is important to decide how big a difference there is between what he has done and the actions that show us the gravity of the murder."" (correct use of ""how big"" and ""actions"")
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""mida ta tegi"" (incorrect use of ""ta"" instead of ""he"")
	* Reference translation: ""what he has done""
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""ta tegi"" (incorrect use of ""ta"" instead of ""he"")
	* Reference translation: ""he has done""
4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone is more formal and lacks the nuances of the original sentence.
	* Reference translation: The tone is more informal and conveys a sense of gravity and importance.
5. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""selle vahel"" (incorrect use of ""selle"" instead of ""the"")
	* Reference translation: ""the gravity of the murder""

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, vocabulary, and idiomatic expressions, which can affect the overall meaning and tone of the sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and conveys the intended meaning more clearly.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, moving ""Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych"" to the end of the sentence. In the reference translation, the words are in the correct order.
2. Accusative case: In the machine translation, ""peaministri"" is in the accusative case, while in the reference translation, it is in the nominative case. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Name forms: The machine translation uses the full form of ""Viktor Janukovõtšiga"" instead of the shortened form ""Viktor Janukovych"" used in the reference translation.
4. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""Kiev"", while the reference translation uses the indefinite article ""a"".
5. Plural nouns: The machine translation changes the plural form of ""peaministri"" to ""peaministrite"", while the reference translation uses the correct plural form ""peaministrit"".
6. Verb tense: The machine translation uses the present tense for both ""met"" verbs, while the reference translation uses the past tense for the first ""met"" verb and the present tense for the second ""met"" verb.
7. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""Ukraina"" instead of ""Ukraine"" in the reference translation.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of grammar, word choice, and spelling. However, it's worth noting that machine translation can be a useful tool for getting the general meaning of a text, especially for languages that are not one's native language.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""There is no Estonian diplomatic representation or honorary consul in the country.""
	* Reference translation: ""There is no Estonian diplomatic mission or honorary consul in the country.""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""diplomatic representation"" instead of ""diplomatic mission"" in the reference translation. This may be due to a difference in terminology or a misunderstanding of the context.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Eesti diplomaatilist esindust ega aukonsulit riigis ei ole.""
	* Reference translation: ""There is no Estonian diplomatic mission or honorary consul in the country.""

The machine translation uses the genitive case incorrectly in the phrase ""Eesti diplomaatilist esindust ega aukonsulit riigis."" In Estonian, the correct phrase would be ""Eesti diplomaatilist esindus riigis.""

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Eesti diplomaatilist esindust ega aukonsulit riigis ei ole.""
	* Reference translation: ""There is no Estonian diplomatic mission or honorary consul in the country.""

The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""diplomaatilist esindust"" in the reference translation. This phrase is a compound word in Estonian that means ""diplomatic mission.""

4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Eesti diplomaatilist esindust ega aukonsulit riigis ei ole.""
	* Reference translation: ""There is no Estonian diplomatic mission or honorary consul in the country.""

The machine translation and the reference translation have different sentence structures. The machine translation uses a longer sentence with more clauses, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence with fewer clauses.

5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: ""Eesti diplomaatilist esindust ega aukonsulit riigis ei ole.""
	* Reference translation: ""There is no Estonian diplomatic mission or honorary consul in the country.""

The machine translation does not convey the same level of fluency as the reference translation. The reference translation sounds more natural and idiomatic in English, while the machine translation sounds more stilted and unnatural.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have significant differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, sentence structure, and fluency. The reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding, while the machine translation is less accurate and sounds less fluent in English.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Some Islamic chemists already knew that some metals would become more difficult when they bought.""
	* Reference translation: ""Some Islamic chemists already knew that some metals would become heavier when they rust.""

The machine translation uses the word ""difficult"" to translate the Estonian word ""roostetades,"" which means ""to become heavier."" However, the reference translation uses the word ""heavier"" to better convey the meaning of the original text.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Some Islamic chemists already knew that some metals would become more difficult when they bought.""
	* Reference translation: ""Some Islamic chemists already knew that some metals would become heavier when they rust.""

The machine translation uses the present tense ""already knew"" to translate the Estonian verb ""mõned islami keemikud teadsid,"" which is in the past tense in the original text. Additionally, the machine translation uses the verb ""bought"" instead of ""rust,"" which is the correct translation of the Estonian word ""roostetades.""

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Some Islamic chemists already knew that some metals would become more difficult when they bought.""
	* Reference translation: ""Some Islamic chemists already knew that some metals would become heavier when they rust.""

The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""roostetades"" in the original text, which means ""to become heavier"" in a metaphorical sense. The reference translation uses the phrase ""when they rust"" to convey this meaning more accurately.

4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""Some Islamic chemists already knew that some metals would become more difficult when they bought.""
	* Reference translation: ""Some Islamic chemists already knew that some metals would become heavier when they rust.""

The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the original text, which refers to the idea that metals become heavier over time due to rusting. The reference translation captures this cultural reference more accurately.

Overall, the machine translation falls short in conveying the meaning and nuances of the original Estonian text, particularly in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. The reference translation provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Estonian text.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kuningad"" (kings) vs. Reference translation: ""chronicle of Renner""
	* Machine translation: ""eestlastega"" (to the Estonians) vs. Reference translation: ""Renner's chronicle""

	* Machine translation: ""piirasid"" (restricted) vs. Reference translation: ""besieged""
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""kuningad eestlastega edasi ja piirasid Tallinnat kümne tuhande mehega"" vs. Reference translation: ""According to the chronicle of Renner, the kings then...""
	* Machine translation: ""kuningad"" is in the singular form, while the reference translation uses the plural form ""kings"" to match the subject of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kuningad eestlastega"" vs. Reference translation: ""Renner's chronicle""
	* Machine translation: ""piirasid"" vs. Reference translation: ""besieged""
	* Machine translation: ""kümne tuhande"" vs. Reference translation: ""ten thousand men""
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""kuningad eestlastega edasi ja piirasid Tallinnat kümne tuhande mehega"" vs. Reference translation: ""According to the chronicle of Renner, the kings then...""
	* Machine translation: The word order is different in the machine translation, with ""kuningad"" coming before ""eestlastega"" instead of after it.
5. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone and style of the machine translation are more formal and literal, while the reference translation is more informal and conversational.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have different word choices, grammatical structures, idiomatic expressions, and tones. The reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding, while the machine translation is more formal and literal.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""The Popperi démarches criterion between science and pseudo-science stipulated that theory must be homogenised.""
	* Reference translation: ""Popper 's demarcation criterion between science and pseudo-science stipulated that theory must be falsified.""

The machine translation uses the word ""homogenised"" instead of ""falsified"". This is a common mistake in machine translation, as ""homogenised"" means to make something uniform or consistent, while ""falsified"" means to prove something false.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""et teooria peab olema falsifitseeritav.""
	* Reference translation: ""and theory must be falsifiable.""

The machine translation uses the word ""falsifitseeritav"" instead of ""falsifiable"". While both words are related to the idea of testing or proving something false, ""falsifitseeritav"" is a more formal and technical term in Estonian, while ""falsifiable"" is a more common and natural-sounding term in English.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""et teooria peab olema falsifitseeritav.""
	* Reference translation: ""and theory must be falsifiable.""

As mentioned earlier, the machine translation uses the word ""falsifitseeritav"" instead of ""falsifiable"". This is another example of a machine translation mistake, as ""falsifitseeritav"" is not a common or natural-sounding expression in English.

4. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""The Popperi démarches criterion between science and pseudo-science stipulated that theory must be homogenised.""
	* Reference translation: ""Popper 's demarcation criterion between science and pseudo-science stipulated that theory must be falsified.""

As mentioned earlier, the machine translation uses the word ""homogenised"" instead of ""falsified"". This is a significant difference in word choice, as ""homogenised"" does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The machine translation makes several mistakes in grammar, vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, and word choice, which can affect the overall quality of the translation. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and natural-sounding option.

Machine Translation:

* ""Water is relatively clean"" is a good translation of the Estonian phrase ""Vesi on suhteliselt puhas"". However, the wording is a bit awkward and could be improved.
* ""even though some places are gathering sludge"" is a good translation of the Estonian phrase ""kuigi mõnda kohta koguneb muda"". However, the wording is a bit wordy and could be simplified.

Reference Translation:

* ""Water is relatively clean"" is a good translation of the Estonian phrase ""Vesi on suhteliselt puhas"". The wording is simple and clear, and it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence.
* ""even though sludge gathers in some places"" is a good translation of the Estonian phrase ""kuigi mõnda kohta koguneb muda"". The wording is more concise and natural-sounding than the machine translation, and it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The machine translation has some minor errors and awkward wording, while the reference translation is more polished and natural-sounding.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation uses the word order ""The General Affairs Council has made the final preparations to direct the draft EU budget to the European Council."" while the reference translation uses ""The General Affairs Council has made the final preparations to forward the draft EU budget to the European Council meeting.""

The machine translation's word order is different from the reference translation because it puts the object ""draft EU budget"" after the verb ""direct,"" while the reference translation places it before the verb ""forward."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and readability of the sentence.

2. Prepositions: The machine translation uses ""to direct"" instead of ""to forward"" in the second sentence, which is a more literal translation of the Estonian original. However, the reference translation uses ""forward"" to convey a more accurate meaning in English.

3. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense ""has made"" to indicate that the General Affairs Council is currently preparing the budget, while the reference translation uses the future tense ""will forward"" to indicate that the budget will be presented to the European Council at a future meeting.

4. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""draft EU budget"" instead of ""EU budget draft"" in the second sentence, which is a more literal translation of the Estonian original. However, the reference translation uses ""EU budget draft"" to convey a more accurate meaning in English.

5. Grammar: The machine translation uses a passive voice construction in the second sentence, which can make the sentence less clear and less concise than the reference translation.

Overall, while the machine translation is grammatically correct, it does not convey the same level of clarity and accuracy as the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and uses more natural language structures, which makes it easier to understand for a native English speaker. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source: Mileetose koolkonna filosoofide järgi pärinevad kõik asjad ühest ürgalgest.
Machine Translation: According to the philosophers in Mileetos School, all the things come from one spinary.
Reference Translation: All things come from one primordial origin, according to the philosophers of the Milesian school.

Differences:

* The machine translation uses the word ""spinary"" instead of ""primordial origin"". This is a significant difference as ""spinary"" is not a word in English and does not convey the same meaning as ""primordial origin"".
* The machine translation also changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""come from"" after ""things"" instead of before it. This can make the sentence harder to understand and may not be the most idiomatic way to express the idea.
* The reference translation uses the phrase ""Milesian school"" to indicate the philosophical tradition being referred to, while the machine translation does not provide any context or clarification for the reader.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or clear as the reference translation. The use of a non-existent word and the altered word order make the sentence harder to understand, and the lack of context for the reader reduces the clarity of the translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Complex theories vs. simple and obvious facts:
	* Machine translation: ""simple and obvious facts must be returned""
	* Reference translation: ""we must return to simple and obvious facts""

The machine translation changes the wording of the original sentence slightly, using the phrase ""simple and obvious facts"" instead of ""must be returned"". This change may have been made to make the sentence more idiomatic in English, but it also changes the meaning of the sentence slightly. In the reference translation, the phrase ""must be returned"" is more literal and conveys a sense of obligation or necessity, whereas in the machine translation, the phrase ""simple and obvious facts"" is more of a statement of fact.

2. Juurest vs. juurde:
	* Machine translation: ""juurest"" is translated as ""facts""
	* Reference translation: ""juurde"" is translated as ""facts""

In this case, the machine translation and reference translation are identical, so there is no difference in quality.

3. Töötama vs. tuleb:
	* Machine translation: ""töötama"" is translated as ""must develop""
	* Reference translation: ""tuleb"" is translated as ""must be developed""

Again, the machine translation and reference translation are slightly different in their wording, but the meaning is the same. The machine translation uses the verb ""töötama"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""tuleb"" in the infinitive form.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice and sentence structure. The machine translation makes some changes to the original sentence that alter its meaning, and it also uses less idiomatic language in some places. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

Machine Translation: ""And if so, the loan will try to identify them straight away.""

* The machine translation uses the phrase ""try to identify them straight away"" which is a bit awkward and not as natural as the reference translation.
* The word ""straight away"" is not a common way to express the idea of ""at once"" in Estonian, so it may not be the most accurate or natural translation.

Reference Translation: ""And if so, Laine will try to identify them at once.""

* The reference translation uses the name ""Laine"" which is the correct name for the person or entity being referred to in the sentence.
* The phrase ""at once"" is a more natural and common way to express the idea of ""immediately"" in Estonian, so it's a more accurate translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural as the reference translation in this case. The reference translation uses more common and natural phrasing, and correctly uses the name ""Laine"" in the sentence.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""vaevles"" (suffered) is not a common word in English, and it is not clear from the context what kind of suffering is being referred to. In the reference translation, ""suffered"" is used, which is a more common and natural way to express the idea.
	* Machine translation: ""perioodiliste"" (periodic diseases) is not a common phrase in English, and it would be better to use ""periodic illnesses"" or ""chronic diseases"" instead.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure in the machine translation is not as clear as in the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence is long and complex, with multiple clauses, which can make it harder to understand. In contrast, the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a clear subject and verb.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""in the hands of"" to convey the idea of Darwin's illnesses not preventing him from working.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The word order in the machine translation is different from the reference translation. In the machine translation, the verb ""had"" is placed after the noun ""life,"" which is not the usual word order in English. In the reference translation, the verb is placed before the noun.
5. Tone:
	* Machine translation: The tone of the machine translation is more formal and objective, while the tone of the reference translation is more informal and conversational.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more common and idiomatic expressions, and the sentence structure is simpler and easier to understand. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses some less common words and phrases, and the sentence structure is more complex and harder to follow.

	Explanation: The machine translation uses the plural form ""they"" instead of the singular form ""the deported"" in the reference translation.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kogesid"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""deported"" (correct)
	Explanation: The machine translation uses the word ""kogesid"" which means ""deported"" in Estonian, but the reference translation uses the English word ""deported"" to maintain consistency in the translation.
3. Tense:
	* Machine translation: present tense ""experienced"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: past tense ""experienced"" (correct)
	Explanation: The machine translation uses the present tense ""experienced"" to describe the past event of deportation, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""experienced"" to maintain consistency in the translation.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""kohutavaid elamistingimusi"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""terrible living conditions"" (correct)

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given source text:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Araabia Liiga lõpetas ametlikult vaatlusmissiooni Süürias."" (The Arab League officially completed its observation mission in Syria.)
	* Reference translation: ""The Arab League officially completed its observation mission in Syria.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""ametlikult"" instead of ""officially"" in the reference translation. ""Ametlikult"" is an Estonian word that means ""officially"", but it is not a direct translation of the English word.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""liiga"" (league)
	* Reference translation: ""Arab League""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""liiga"" instead of the English name ""Arab League"".
3. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""vaatlusmissiooni"" (observation mission)
	* Reference translation: ""observation mission""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""vaatlusmissiooni"" instead of the English word ""observation mission"".
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Süürias."" (Syria.)
	* Reference translation: ""in Syria.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a prepositional phrase ""in Syria"" to provide more context, while the machine translation uses a standalone noun ""Süürias"".
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation seems to struggle with the word order in the sentence, resulting in an awkward and unnatural sentence structure.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation has a more natural and fluid sentence structure, with the words in the sentence arranged in a more logical order.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, vocabulary, and word choice, and the sentence structure is awkward and unnatural. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and has a more natural flow.

Machine Translation: ""One of the most original symbols of the architectural architecture of Minos is its unique pillars.""

Reference Translation: ""One of the most original symbols of the architecture of the Minoan culture is its unique pillars.""

Here are the differences I found between the two translations:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""architectural architecture"" instead of ""Minoan culture"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly.
2. Phrase structure: The machine translation separates the phrase ""of Minos"" from the noun ""pillars"" with a comma, while the reference translation does not use a comma. This is a stylistic difference, but it can affect the readability of the sentence.
3. Unique vs. original: The machine translation uses the term ""unique pillars"" instead of ""original symbols of the architecture of the Minoan culture."" While both terms can be translated as ""original,"" the machine translation uses a more general term that could apply to any structure, while the reference translation uses a term that specifically refers to the Minoan culture.
4. Word order: The machine translation puts the adjective ""original"" before the noun ""symbols,"" while the reference translation puts it after the noun. This is a minor difference in word order, but it can affect the emphasis of the sentence.

Overall, the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are relatively minor, but they can affect the accuracy and readability of the translation. The reference translation is more specific and accurate in terms of the cultural context and the word choice, while the machine translation is more general and may not convey the same level of detail and nuance.

	* Machine translation: ""He asked the Montréal journalist Michael Woloschuk to get clarity in his life."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""He hired a Montréal journalist Michael Woloschuk to get clarity about his father's life."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong verb form in the sentence, which is a common mistake in Estonian-English translation. The correct verb form is ""hired"" instead of ""asked.""

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Montréal journalist"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Montréal journalist Michael Woloschuk"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong word choice for the profession of the journalist. The correct word is ""journalist,"" not ""Montréal journalist.""

3. Punctuation:
	* Machine translation: ""He asked the Montréal journalist Michael Woloschuk to get clarity in his life."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""He hired a Montréal journalist Michael Woloschuk to get clarity about his father's life."" (correct)

The machine translation lacks punctuation at the end of the sentence, which can make it difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation includes a period at the end of the sentence, which makes it easier to read and understand.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""get clarity in his life"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""get clarity about his father's life"" (correct)

The machine translation uses an idiomatic expression that is not commonly used in English. The correct idiomatic expression is ""get clarity about something,"" which is used to describe the act of gaining understanding or insight into a particular topic or situation.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation uses the correct verb forms, word choice, punctuation, and idiomatic expressions to convey the intended meaning of the sentence. The machine translation, on the other hand, contains several errors that can make it difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Normal science in general is keeping the philosophy away, and rightly so."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Normal science in general is keeping a distance from philosophy, and probably rightly so."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong word order in the second clause, which results in an awkward and unnatural sentence structure. The reference translation maintains the correct word order and syntax, making the sentence easier to read and understand.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""hoiab"" (meaning ""away"") is not a suitable translation for the Estonian word ""filosoofiast"" (meaning ""philosophy"").
	* Reference translation: ""probably rightly so"" is a more accurate translation of the Estonian phrase "" ja küllap õigusega"" (meaning ""and probably rightly so"").

The machine translation uses the word ""hoiab"" to translate ""filosoofiast"", which is not a common or idiomatic usage of the word. The reference translation uses a more appropriate phrase to convey the intended meaning.

3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""keeping a distance"" in the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""keeping a distance"" to convey the idea of maintaining a separation or gap between philosophy and normal science.

The machine translation does not recognize the idiomatic expression used in the reference translation, which can result in a less natural and less accurate translation.

4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the Estonian phrase, which may not be immediately familiar to English speakers.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation provides a more culturally appropriate translation by using the phrase ""probably rightly so"", which is more likely to be understood by English speakers.

The machine translation does not consider the cultural context of the Estonian phrase, which may result in a less accurate and less natural translation.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the reference translation is more accurate and natural than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Estonian phrase more effectively, including the idiomatic expression, cultural references, and grammatical structure.

3. Pronouns: The machine translation uses the pronoun ""her"" to refer to Annemai, while the reference translation uses the pronoun ""she"".
4. Prepositions: The machine translation uses the preposition ""to"" to indicate the location where Annemai will receive customers, while the reference translation uses the preposition ""at"".
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""customers"" while the reference translation uses the word ""clients"".
6. Grammar: The machine translation has a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with a subordinate clause.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has some errors in word order, tense, pronouns, prepositions, and word choice, which can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and idiomatic, with a better understanding of the Estonian language and culture.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""järgijad"" (incorrect)

	* Explanation: The machine translation uses the word ""järgijad"" which means ""thoughts"" or ""ideas"" in Estonian, while the reference translation uses the word ""way"" to convey the meaning of the original sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""uskuma"" (incorrect)

2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""umbes 30 õhulööki"" (around 30 hours)

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""umbes 30 õhulööki"" which means ""around 30 hours"" in Estonian, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""about 30 air strikes"" which is a more common way to express the same idea in English.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Valitsusväed tõrjusid mässulised"" (government forces rejected)

5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""mässuliste positsioonidele linnast väljas anti ka umbes 30 õhulööki"" (given around 30 hours)
	* Reference translation: ""given about 30 air strikes""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian grammar structure ""linnast väljas"" (given around) which is not common in English, while the reference translation uses the more common English grammar structure ""given about"".

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the Estonian sentence. The machine translation uses more informal language and idiomatic expressions, which can make it harder to understand for non-native speakers. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for any further communication or translation needs.

2. Gender agreement: In the machine translation, the pronoun ""her"" is used to refer to Margna's girlfriend, which is incorrect because Margna's girlfriend is not explicitly mentioned as a female in the source text. In the reference translation, the pronoun ""his"" is used, which is correct because Margna's girlfriend is referred to as ""his"" in the source text.
3. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""wants"") to describe Margna's desire to marry his girlfriend, while the reference translation uses the future tense (""will get married""). This difference in tense is due to the different grammatical structures of the two languages.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""abielluda"" (meaning ""wife"") instead of ""naisega"" (meaning ""girlfriend""), which is the word used in the source text. This difference in word choice may be due to the machine translation's limited vocabulary or its inability to understand the nuances of the source text.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""Marele reisi Marokosse"" (meaning ""a trip to Morocco"") used in the source text. This is a common expression in Estonian that may be difficult for a machine translation system to recognize.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the source text.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""feeling"" instead of ""impulse"". While both words can be translated as ""tung"" in Estonian, the reference translation uses ""impulse"" to better convey the intended meaning in English.
2. Idiomatic expression: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""this feeling does not mean that the truth is something else"" which is not a direct translation of the Estonian phrase ""et tõsi on miski muu"". The reference translation uses a more literal translation of the Estonian phrase, ""this impulse does not mean that something else is true"".
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""does not mean"" instead of the past tense ""meant"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence slightly, placing ""as Wittgenstein says"" at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the quotation mark. This is a stylistic difference and does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source Text: Tundub, et sellel kaalutlusel on eriline jõud Jimi juhtumil.
Machine Translation: It seems that this consideration has a special force in the case of Jim.
Reference Translation: It seems that this consideration has a special weight in Jim 's case.

Difference 1: Word Choice (Force vs. Weight)
The machine translation uses the word ""force"" to translate ""eriline jõud,"" while the reference translation uses ""weight."" The choice of word depends on the context and the intended meaning. In this case, ""weight"" might be a better choice because it implies a greater importance or significance in Jim's case.

2. Grammar and Sentence Structure
The machine translation and reference translation have similar sentence structures, with a subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern. However, the machine translation uses the present tense (""has"") to translate ""on eriline jõud,"" while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense (""has a special weight""). The choice of tense depends on the context and the intended meaning. In this case, the present perfect tense might be more appropriate to convey the idea that the consideration has been having a special weight in Jim's case for some time.

3. Idiomatic Expressions
The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""eriline jõud"" in the same way as the reference translation. ""Eriline jõud"" is an Estonian idiom that can be translated as ""special weight"" or ""greater importance."" The reference translation uses a more idiomatic expression to convey the intended meaning.

4. Cultural References
The machine translation does not take into account any cultural references or nuances in the source text. The reference translation, on the other hand, captures the cultural context of the source text by using the phrase ""Jimi juhtumil,"" which refers to Jim's personal circumstances or situation.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the source text better, including the choice of word, grammar and sentence structure, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references.

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""coal"" (kool) twice, while the reference translation uses both ""coal"" (kool) and ""sawdust"" (savu).
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""It tested"" (Ka testas)
	* Reference translation: ""He experimented"" (Hell on experimented)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb ""tested"" (Ka testas) in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""experimented"" (Hell on experimented) in the past tense.
3. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""sails"" (laevad)
	* Reference translation: ""bricks"" (kivikud)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""sails"" (laevad), which is not a word that is commonly used in Estonian. The reference translation uses the word ""bricks"" (kivikud), which is a more appropriate translation for the context.
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""among other things"" (kuna other things)
	* Reference translation: ""among other things, coal"" (kuna other things, kool)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a more general sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more specific sentence structure to indicate that the experimenter was specifically interested in coal.
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""mortar"" (müriseguga)
	* Reference translation: ""masonry"" (müris)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""mortar"" (müriseguga), which is not a common idiomatic expression in Estonian. The reference translation uses the word ""masonry"" (müris), which is a more appropriate translation for the context.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, vocabulary, sentence structure, and idiomatic expressions.

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""mongolite"" instead of ""Mongol incursions"" in the reference translation.
3. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""jäi mongolite retkedest"" (remained unaffected by the Mongol incursions)
	* Reference translation: ""gained strength""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""jäi mongolite retkedest"" instead of ""gained strength"" in the reference translation.
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Selle pearivaal Nikaia jäi mongolite retkedest kõrvale ja kogus jõudu Balkani poolsaarel."" (The main rival of Nicea remained unaffected by the Mongol incursions and gained strength on the Balkan peninsula.)
	* Reference translation: ""Its main rival, Nicea, was not affected by the Mongol incursions and gained strength on the Balkan peninsula.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a longer sentence with more clauses, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence with fewer clauses.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in grammar, vocabulary, word choice, and sentence structure. The reference translation is generally more accurate and idiomatic in Estonian, while the machine translation has some errors and inaccuracies.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""hospitality medicine"" (machine translation) vs. ""abstinence therapy"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: The machine translation uses a more general term ""hospitality medicine"" to translate ""võõrutusravil steroidide sõltuvuse tõttu"", which doesn't accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. The reference translation uses ""abstinence therapy"" to better convey the idea of Joonatan being on a treatment program for steroid dependence.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Image was a hospitality medicine"" (machine translation) vs. ""Joonatan was on abstinence therapy"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: The machine translation uses a subject-verb-object word order, which is different from the reference translation's subject-verb word order. In the machine translation, ""Image"" is the subject, ""was"" is the verb, and ""hospitality medicine"" is the object, while in the reference translation, ""Joonatan"" is the subject, ""was"" is the verb, and ""abstinence therapy"" is the object.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""dependence of steroids"" (machine translation) vs. ""dependence on steroids"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: The machine translation uses a more literal translation of the Estonian phrase ""steroidide sõltuvuse tõttu"", which doesn't capture the idiomatic meaning of the phrase. The reference translation uses the more common English idiom ""dependence on steroids"" to convey the idea of Joonatan's reliance on steroids.
4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation has a more formal and impersonal tone, while the reference translation has a more conversational and personal tone.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original sentence better, including the idiomatic expressions and the tone of the text. The machine translation, on the other hand, struggles to convey the meaning and tone of the original sentence, and its word choices and grammar are less natural-sounding.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""There is also poaching, including the killing of rare animals for feed or the sale of ski.""
	* Reference translation: ""There is also poaching, including the killing of rare animals for food or for sale as souvenirs.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""feed"" instead of ""food"" in the second sentence, which is incorrect. The reference translation uses the correct word ""food"" to indicate that the rare animals are being hunted for human consumption.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""sealhulgas haruldaste loomade tapmist""
	* Reference translation: ""rare animals""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""loomade"" which means ""made"" or ""produced"" in Estonian, but in this context, it should be ""haruldaste"" which means ""rare"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""söögiks või suveniirina müümiseks""
	* Reference translation: ""as souvenirs""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""söögiks või suveniirina müümiseks"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more common phrase ""as souvenirs"".
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""poaching, including the killing of rare animals for feed or the sale of ski.""
	* Reference translation: ""poaching, including the killing of rare animals for food or for sale as souvenirs.""
	* Difference: The machine translation is not accurate in its translation of the word ""poaching"". The correct term in English is ""poaching"", not ""poaching,"". Additionally, the machine translation is also not accurate in its translation of the word ""rare animals"", which should be translated as ""rare animals"" not ""rare"".

Based on the above analysis, it is clear that the machine translation is not of high quality and requires significant improvement. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and idiomatic in its translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""One in three of these walls may include urban areas.""
	* Reference translation: ""The walls of one of the three may contain stronghold foundations.""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""urban areas,"" which is a bit vague and doesn't accurately convey the meaning of the Estonian phrase ""linnusevundamente."" The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the phrase ""stronghold foundations,"" which is a more accurate translation of the Estonian phrase ""linnusevundamente.""

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""One in three of these walls may include urban areas.""
	* Reference translation: ""The walls of one of the three may contain stronghold foundations.""

The machine translation uses the present tense ""may include"" to translate the Estonian verb ""sisaldada,"" which is in the imperfective mood. The reference translation uses the present tense ""may contain"" to translate the Estonian verb ""sisaldada,"" which is in the imperfective mood.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""One in three of these walls may include urban areas.""
	* Reference translation: ""The walls of one of the three may contain stronghold foundations.""

The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""linnusevundamente"" in the Estonian phrase, which means something like ""deeply rooted"" or ""firmly established."" The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the phrase ""stronghold foundations,"" which is a more accurate translation of the Estonian idiom.

4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""One in three of these walls may include urban areas.""
	* Reference translation: ""The walls of one of the three may contain stronghold foundations.""

The machine translation doesn't take into account the cultural context of the Estonian phrase, which is likely to be more relevant to a local audience. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses language that is more culturally appropriate and relevant to the Estonian context.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Estonian language and culture better, making it a more reliable and effective translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice and terminology:
	* Machine translation: ""Liralpolkovnik"" is translated as ""Chief of General Assistance"" instead of ""Chief of the General Staff"" (which is the correct term in English).
	* Machine translation: ""Grigori Pedtshenko"" is translated as ""General Liralpolkovnik Grigori Pedtshenko"" instead of ""Admiral General Grigori Pedtshenko"" (which is the correct term in English).
2. Grammar and sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is different in the machine translation, with the verb ""announced"" placed in the middle of the sentence instead of at the end.
	* Machine translation: The word order in the sentence is different, with ""Ukraine"" coming before ""General Liralpolkovnik Grigori Pedtshenko"" instead of after it.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The phrase ""kaitsejõudude kindralstaabi"" is translated as ""Defence Forces"" instead of ""Armed Forces"" (which is the more common term in English).
4. Names and titles:
	* Machine translation: ""Grigori Pedtshenko"" is translated as ""General Liralpolkovnik Grigori Pedtshenko"" instead of ""Admiral General Grigori Pedtshenko"" (which is the correct term in English).
5. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: The name of the person resigning is incorrect in the machine translation, with ""Grigori Pedtshenko"" being used instead of ""Admiral General Grigori Pedtshenko"".

Overall, the machine translation is not very accurate compared to the reference translation. There are several errors in word choice, grammar, and terminology, which can make the translation difficult to understand for a native English speaker. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a low rating, around 2 or 3 out of 10.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""background condition"" to translate ""taustatingimus"", while the reference translation uses ""amplifier"". This difference in word choice may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""background condition"" implies a more general or indirect connection between the client and the favourable reason, while ""amplifier"" suggests a more direct or intense connection.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the passive voice in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the active voice. In the machine translation, the sentence reads ""The client is a background condition that makes a favourable reason stronger than it would otherwise be"", while in the reference translation, it reads ""The amplifier is a background condition that makes a favourable reason stronger than it would otherwise be"". The difference in grammar may affect the emphasis and focus of the sentence, with the passive voice potentially giving more attention to the client itself, rather than the action of the amplifier.
3. Idiomaticity: The machine translation uses the phrase ""soosiva põhjendi"", which is an idiomatic expression in Estonian, but may not be immediately familiar to English speakers. The reference translation avoids this idiomatic expression and uses a more straightforward translation, ""a favourable reason"". While both translations are grammatically correct, the idiomatic expression in the machine translation may affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the sentence.
4. Clarity: The machine translation is less clear and concise than the reference translation. The machine translation uses more words to convey the same meaning, and the sentence structure is less straightforward. For example, in the machine translation, the sentence reads ""The client is a background condition that makes a favourable reason stronger than it would otherwise be"", while in the reference translation, it reads ""The amplifier is a background condition that makes a favourable reason stronger than it would otherwise be"". The reference translation is more direct and to the point, making it easier to understand the meaning of the sentence.

Overall, while both translations are grammatically correct, the reference translation is more natural and idiomatic in Estonian, while the machine translation is less clear and concise. To improve the quality of the translation, the machine translation could benefit from more attention to word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions, as well as a more direct and concise sentence structure.

1. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, moving ""you can talk meaningfully"" to the end of the sentence. In the reference translation, the word order is preserved, with ""you can talk meaningfully about E's activities.""
2. Pronouns: The machine translation uses the pronoun ""you"" instead of ""you can,"" which is more formal and less common in spoken Estonian. In the reference translation, ""you can"" is used to maintain the same level of formality.
3. Tense: The machine translation changes the tense of the sentence, using the present tense (""doubtful whether you can"") instead of the past tense (""doubtful whether you could"") in the reference translation.
4. Possessive form: The machine translation changes the possessive form of the noun ""activities"" to ""E's activities,"" while the reference translation uses the more common possessive form ""E 's activities.""
5. Punctuation: The machine translation adds a comma after ""doubtful"" to separate the two clauses, while the reference translation does not use a comma.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of grammar, word order, and punctuation. The reference translation is more formal and idiomatic, while the machine translation is more informal and has some grammatical errors.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""tales of clean gold"" instead of the reference translation's ""solid balls of pure gold."" This suggests that the machine translation may not have fully understood the meaning of the original Estonian phrase, which is more literal and specific.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are weighed"") instead of the reference translation's past tense (""weigh""). This may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately convey the tense of the original sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the adverb ""below"" at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation places it earlier in the sentence. This may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately preserve the word order of the original sentence.
4. Phrase structure: The machine translation separates the phrase ""of pure gold"" into two separate phrases, while the reference translation keeps it as a single phrase. This may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately recognize and translate longer phrases.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""alla 100 000 kg"" (which means ""under 100 000 kg""), while the reference translation does. This may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately recognize and translate idiomatic expressions.

Overall, the machine translation falls short in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, fluency, accuracy, and cultural nuances. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more natural and accurate translation of the original Estonian sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""It has been assumed"" (machine translation) vs. ""It has been assumed that"" (reference translation)
	* Machine translation: ""oma poliitilist huvi"" (machine translation) vs. ""their political interest"" (reference translation)
	* Machine translation: ""selles piirkonnas"" (machine translation) vs. ""the region"" (reference translation)
	* Machine translation: ""rünnata riialaste väge"" (machine translation) vs. ""to attack the forces from Riga"" (reference translation)
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The verb tense is inconsistent in the machine translation, with ""has been assumed"" in the first sentence and ""intended"" in the second sentence. In contrast, the reference translation maintains a consistent verb tense throughout.
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the passive voice in the second sentence, while the reference translation uses the active voice.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""kavatseti demonstreerida"" (to demonstrate) in the source text, which is a common way to express the idea of showing or proving something.
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not translate ""riialaste"" (forces from Riga) correctly, as it should be translated as ""Riga-based forces"" or ""forces from Riga"".
4. Contextual understanding:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not fully understand the context of the source text, as it assumes that ""demonstreerida"" (to demonstrate) refers to a general political interest in the region, rather than a specific demonstration of interest in the forces from Riga.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the original Estonian text. The machine translation makes several errors in word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions, which can result in a loss of meaning and clarity. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more reliable and accurate translation of the Estonian text.

Machine Translation: Bulgaria held early parliamentary elections.

* The machine translation uses the word ""Bulgaria"" instead of ""Bulgaarias"" in the source text.

* The translation is more specific and accurate than the machine translation, as it includes the additional information that the elections were held early.

Overall, the machine translation is lacking in accuracy and specificity compared to the reference translation. The machine translation uses the wrong spelling of the country's name and does not include the additional information provided in the reference translation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating than the reference translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""emmodus"" instead of ""emotsiot"", which is the correct Estonian word for ""emotion"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the wrong verb form in the sentence. The Estonian sentence is in the present tense, but the machine translation uses the past tense (""were ultimately political...""). This can make the sentence sound less natural and less accurate.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't quite capture the idiomatic expression used in the Estonian sentence. The phrase ""on lõppkokkuvõttes poliitilised ning olulised meie võimutunde seisukohast"" is a bit awkward in English, but it conveys the idea that emotions are important in terms of our sense of power. The machine translation doesn't quite capture this nuance.
4. Sentence structure: The machine translation changes the sentence structure compared to the reference translation. The Estonian sentence is a simple sentence, while the machine translation breaks it up into two separate clauses. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less clear.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Estonian sentence better, and it is more idiomatic in English.

1. Word choice: In the machine translation, the word ""ice"" is used instead of ""persistence"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. In the context of the sentence, ""ice"" doesn't quite convey the same idea as ""persistence.""
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""can"") instead of the past tense (""could"") in the reference translation. This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame of the action being described. The use of the present tense in the machine translation makes it seem like the new theory is still in the process of linking old theories, whereas the reference translation implies that the linking has already been done.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence slightly, placing ""link old theories"" after ""new theory"" instead of before it. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall flow of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""link old theories"" instead of the more idiomatic ""build on existing theories."" This is a more significant difference, as it affects the way the sentence conveys the idea of the new theory being related to existing knowledge.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation gets the overall meaning of the sentence correct, but there are some minor errors in the word choice and grammar. For example, ""energy jäävuseteooria"" should be ""energy persistence theory"" in the reference translation.

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a score of 60% and the reference translation a score of 80%.

The machine translation uses the word ""benefit"" instead of ""good"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. ""Benefit"" has a more general connotation, encompassing both material and intangible advantages, while ""good"" has a broader meaning, including moral or ethical excellence.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""peab olema hüve üldiselt""
	* Reference translation: ""must be the good in general""

The machine translation uses the infinitive phrase ""peab olema hüve üldiselt"" instead of the passive construction ""must be the good in general"" in the reference translation. This difference in grammar structure can affect the sentence's overall meaning and flow.

3. Idiomatic expressions:

	* Reference translation: ""of greater importance than that of another""

The machine translation uses the Estonian idiomatic expression ""rohkem tähtsust kui teise omal"" instead of the more literal ""of greater importance than that of another"" in the reference translation. While both expressions convey the same meaning, the idiomatic expression may sound more natural in Estonian.

4. Word order:

The machine translation may have confused the two place names, which is a common issue in machine translations.
4. Tense: The machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation is in the past tense. This is a more significant difference, as the tense can change the meaning of the sentence entirely. The machine translation may have struggled to convey the correct tense in this case.

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""ühendus"" (perhaps) instead of ""ühendus"" (perhaps one can agree) in the reference translation.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kahe ühevõrra"" (two good alternatives)
	* Reference translation: ""two good alternatives""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""ühevõrra"" (alternatives) instead of ""alternatives"" in the reference translation.
3. Phrasing:
	* Machine translation: ""siis kumbki valik võib olla õigustatud ja mõistlik"" (and each option can be justified and reasonable)
	* Reference translation: ""and each option can be justified and reasonable""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""kumbki"" (and) instead of ""and"" in the reference translation.
4. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation flows smoothly and is easy to read.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation also flows smoothly and is easy to read.
	* Difference: Both translations are fluent and easy to read, but the machine translation may not capture the nuances of the original sentence as well as the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation captures the overall meaning of the sentence, but there are some minor differences in grammar, word choice, and phrasing compared to the reference translation. However, both translations are still quite good and could be used in different contexts depending on the desired level of formality or accuracy.

59	"<s>[INST]<<SYS>>You are a helpful assistant.<</SYS>>A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Slipperi"" is translated as ""resignation"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""Slipper."" This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the present tense (""further weakened"") to describe the impact of Slipper's resignation, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""weakened"") to indicate that the impact has already occurred. This is a more accurate representation of the original Estonian sentence, which is in the past tense.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""nõrgendas veelgi"" in the original Estonian sentence. This expression is not easily translatable, but it roughly means ""to a great extent"" or ""to a significant degree."" The reference translation includes this idiomatic expression, which helps to convey the intended meaning of the sentence.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence slightly, placing ""Slipperi"" after ""Prime Minister Julia Gillard's."" In the original Estonian sentence, the word order is different, with ""Slipperi Julia Gillard's"" appearing before ""Prime Minister Julia Gillard's."" This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall clarity of the sentence.
5. Tone:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation has a more formal tone than the reference translation. The reference translation uses more informal language, which is more appropriate for a news article.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the idiomatic expressions and word order of the original Estonian sentence more closely, and it has a more appropriate tone for a news article. The machine translation, on the other hand, has some minor errors in word choice and grammar, and it lacks the nuances of the original Estonian sentence.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Several Gulf states were recognised"" (singular)
	* Reference translation: ""Several Gulf states had recognised"" (plural)

The machine translation uses the singular form ""were recognised"" to match the original Estonian sentence, while the reference translation uses the plural form ""had recognised"" to match the meaning of the sentence.

2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""In the past"" (simple past tense)
	* Reference translation: ""In the past"" (simple past tense)

Both the machine translation and the reference translation use the simple past tense to convey the same meaning.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Syria's highest power""
	* Reference translation: ""Syria's power""

The machine translation places the phrase ""Syria's highest power"" after the verb ""were recognised"", while the reference translation places it before the verb.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""representative of Syria's highest power""
	* Reference translation: ""representative of Syria's power""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""representative of Syria's highest power"", which is not a common idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more common phrase ""representative of Syria's power"".

5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""coalition as the representative""
	* Reference translation: ""coalition as representing""

The machine translation uses the preposition ""as"" in the wrong position, which can make the sentence sound less natural in English. The reference translation uses the preposition ""as representing"" to convey the correct meaning.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation better conveys the meaning of the original Estonian sentence and uses more idiomatic expressions. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kuid"" (Estonian) vs. ""indecision"" (English)
		+ In the machine translation, the word ""kuid"" is translated as ""indecision,"" which is a more formal and technical term in English. However, in this context, ""kuid"" could also be translated as ""hesitation"" or ""lack of decision,"" which might be more appropriate.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Mikhail Asen I"" (Estonian) vs. ""Mikhail Asen allowed"" (English)
		+ In the machine translation, the name ""Mikhail Asen I"" is translated as a single sentence, which is not the usual way to express this idea in English. In English, it would be more common to say ""Mikhail Asen allowed"" or ""Mikhail Asen made a decision.""
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""võimaldas"" (Estonian) vs. ""won back"" (English)
		+ In the machine translation, the word ""võimaldas"" is translated as ""won back,"" which is a more common way to express this idea in English. However, in Estonian, the word ""võimaldas"" can also mean ""to gain control of"" or ""to regain,"" which might be more appropriate in this context.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""tagasi võita"" (Estonian) vs. ""back all its lost territory"" (English)
		+ In the machine translation, the phrase ""tagasi võita"" is translated as ""back all its lost territory,"" which is a more formal and literal way to express this idea in English. However, in English, it's more common to say ""reclaim its lost territory"" or ""regain its lost land.""
5. Names and places:
	* Machine translation: ""Nikaial"" (Estonian) vs. ""Nicaragua"" (English)
		+ In the machine translation, the name ""Nikaial"" is translated as ""Nicaragua,"" which is the more common spelling in English. However, in Estonian, the name ""Nikaial"" is also commonly used to refer to Nicaragua.
6. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""välja arvatud"" (Estonian) vs. ""with the exception of"" (English)
		+ In the machine translation, the phrase ""välja arvatud"" is translated as ""with the exception of,"" which is a more common way to express this idea in English. However, in Estonian, the phrase ""välja arvatud"" can also mean ""except for"" or ""excluding.""

Overall, the machine translation has some errors and inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The word choice, grammar, word order, idiomatic expressions, names and places, and tense all differ between the two translations. Therefore, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as relatively low.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""conception"" (machine translation) vs. ""formation of concepts"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: The machine translation uses the word ""conception"" which is more general and can refer to any idea or notion, while the reference translation uses ""formation of concepts"" which is more specific and refers to the process of creating or developing concepts.
2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""is"" (machine translation) vs. ""is closer"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is"" to indicate that historical conception is closer to reality, while the reference translation uses the present perfect ""is closer"" to convey that the historical formation of concepts is closer to reality at this moment.
3. Modality:
	* Machine translation: ""than"" (machine translation) vs. ""than that of"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: The machine translation uses ""than"" to compare historical conception with natural science, while the reference translation uses ""than that of"" to specify that the comparison is between historical formation of concepts and natural science.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""perception of reality"" (machine translation) vs. ""reality"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: The machine translation places ""perception of reality"" after ""historical conception"", while the reference translation places ""reality"" before ""historical conception"".
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kujutamisele"" (machine translation) vs. ""depiction of reality"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""kujutamisele"" which doesn't have an exact English equivalent, while the reference translation uses ""depiction of reality"" to convey the same meaning.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation and the reference translation have different levels of quality. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic, while the machine translation has some errors in word choice, tense, and word order. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher rating than the machine translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""tooth"" instead of ""teeth"" in the reference translation. This is a common mistake in machine translation, as it often struggles to distinguish between singular and plural nouns.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are"") for the verb ""to be"" in the reference translation, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""were""). This is a more accurate representation of the original Estonian sentence.
3. Lexical errors: The machine translation uses ""snowless"" instead of ""bony tail"" in the reference translation. This is a significant error, as ""snowless"" does not make sense in this context and does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Estonian sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""olid näiteks hambad"" in the reference translation. This expression is a common way to describe something that is unique or exceptional, and it is not easily translated into English.

	* Machine translation: ""hands"" (kätes) is translated as ""hands"" (langes) in the reference translation.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is different in the two translations. The machine translation has a more complex sentence structure with multiple clauses, while the reference translation has a simpler sentence structure with a subject-verb-object word order.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""black hole"" (musta kuum) is not a common idiomatic expression in Estonian, and it may not be immediately clear to a native English speaker. In the reference translation, the phrase ""Imperial treasury chest"" (keiserlik varalaegas) is used instead, which is a more common and idiomatic expression in English.
4. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""bulgaarlaste"" (Bulgarians) is not a commonly used term in English, and it may not be immediately clear to a native English speaker. In the reference translation, the phrase ""the victorious Bulgarians"" (voitlikud Bulgarians) is used instead, which is a more common and idiomatic expression in English.
5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The reference to ""the crown and the cross"" (kroon ja rist) may not be immediately clear to a native English speaker, as these are religious symbols that are not commonly used in English. In the reference translation, the phrase ""the Imperial treasury chest"" (keiserlik varalaegas) is used instead, which is a more common and idiomatic expression in English.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, vocabulary, and cultural references. While the machine translation may be able to generate a sentence that is grammatically correct, it may not always produce the most idiomatic or culturally appropriate translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Modality: The most significant difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of modal verbs. The machine translation uses the verb ""is"" to indicate the difference between the two things, while the reference translation uses the modal verb ""must"" to convey the same idea. The use of ""must"" adds more emphasis and precision to the translation, making it more accurate and idiomatic.
2. Fashionability: The machine translation uses the term ""fashionable"" to describe the difference between the two things, while the reference translation uses the term ""modal difference."" While both terms could be used to convey the idea of a difference in approach or style, the reference translation uses a more technical and precise term that is more commonly used in linguistic contexts.
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""thing"" to refer to the two things being compared, while the reference translation uses the term ""asja."" While both words could be used to refer to a thing or an object, the reference translation uses a more specific and technical term that is more commonly used in Estonian language.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense to describe the difference between the two things, while the reference translation uses the infinitive form of the verb ""to be."" While both tenses could be used to convey the idea of a difference, the reference translation uses a more formal and precise tense that is more commonly used in Estonian language.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The use of modal verbs, precise word choice, and formal grammar all contribute to a more polished and professional translation. While the machine translation is still understandable, it lacks the nuance and precision of the reference translation, which is why I would give it a lower quality rating.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""See on kohutav, kuid see on oluline osa kollektiivsest julgeolekust."" (The sentence is in the present tense, but the verb ""see"" is in the infinitive form.)
	* Reference translation: ""This is terrible, but it is an important part of collective security."" (The sentence is in the present tense and the verb ""is"" is in the third person singular form.)
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""kohutav"" (awful)
	* Reference translation: ""terrible""
	* Machine translation: ""oluline"" (awful)
	* Reference translation: ""important""
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""see on kohutav"" (literally ""see on awful"")
	* Reference translation: ""This is terrible""
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The sentence is longer and more complex than the reference translation.
5. Fluency and naturalness:
	* Machine translation: The sentence sounds unnatural and awkward, with the use of the infinitive form of the verb ""see"" and the word ""oluline"" which doesn't quite fit the context.
	* Reference translation: The sentence sounds more natural and fluent, with the use of the present tense and the correct word choice.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation. The machine translation has more grammatical errors, uses less idiomatic expressions, and the sentence structure is less natural and fluent. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating than the reference translation.

Machine Translation: ""The accessories have a legal obligation not to make incorrect recommendations.""

Reference Translation: ""The broker has a legal obligation not to make incorrect recommendations.""

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""accessories"" instead of ""broker"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. In this case, the reference translation is more accurate.
2. Gender agreement: In Estonian, nouns have different forms depending on their gender. The machine translation uses the masculine form ""on"" for the noun ""recommendations"", while the reference translation uses the feminine form ""anda"". This is a more accurate reflection of the original Estonian sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""not to make incorrect recommendations"" is placed after the noun ""accessories"", while in the reference translation, it is placed before the noun. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""make incorrect recommendations"" instead of the more idiomatic ""give wrong advice"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall fluency of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, gender agreement, word order, and idiomatic expressions. However, it is important to note that machine translation is a complex task and can be affected by many factors, including the quality of the training data and the complexity of the sentence.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Peamised keskkonnaprobleemid"" is translated as ""The main environmental problems"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""The main environmental problems in Portugal"" to provide more context.
	* Machine translation: The verb tenses in the source text are maintained in the machine translation, but the reference translation changes the verb tense to match the target language. For example, ""keskkonnaprobleemid"" is in the singular form in the source text, but the reference translation uses ""problems"" in the plural form to match the English syntax.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses more general vocabulary than the reference translation. For example, ""soil erosion"" is translated as ""soil loss"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""soil erosion"" to provide more detail.
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses ""industry"" as the translation for ""industria"" in the source text, while the reference translation uses ""manufacturing"" to provide more context.
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses ""vehicles"" as the translation for ""vehekul"" in the source text, while the reference translation uses ""cars"" to provide more context.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""pinnase erosioon"" in the source text, which means ""soil loss due to erosion"". The reference translation uses ""soil erosion"" to provide a more accurate translation.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the cultural reference to ""coastal areas"" in the source text, which is important for understanding the context of the environmental problems in Portugal.
5. Fluency and readability:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation is less fluent and less readable than the reference translation. The machine translation uses more formal language and does not convey the same level of detail and nuance as the reference translation.

Overall, the reference translation provides a more accurate and nuanced translation of the source text than the machine translation. While the machine translation captures some of the key terms and concepts, it does not fully convey the context and detail of the original text.

2. Machine Translation: However, differences in courage do not create a new kind of new kind.
3. Reference Translation: However, differences in courage do not create a new kind.

Comparison:

* The machine translation and reference translation both translate ""Aga julguse sügavuse erinevused"" as ""differences in courage.""
* However, the machine translation adds the phrase ""new kind"" at the end of the sentence, which is not present in the reference translation.
* The reference translation simply translates the sentence as is, without adding any extra words.

Evaluation:

* The machine translation introduces a grammatical error by adding a new phrase at the end of the sentence, which is not present in the original Estonian text.
* The reference translation accurately translates the sentence without introducing any errors.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Estonian text than the machine translation. The machine translation introduces a grammatical error and also changes the meaning of the sentence slightly by adding the phrase ""new kind.""

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the verb ""called"" is in the past tense, but it is in the present tense in the reference translation.
2. Prepositions: The machine translation uses the preposition ""to"" before ""victims of the floods"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses the preposition ""for"" in the first instance and ""to"" in the second instance.
3. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""victims of the floods"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses the indefinite article ""a"" in the first instance and the definite article ""the"" in the second instance.
4. Tense consistency: The machine translation has a inconsistent tense, using the past tense in ""called for assistance"" but the present tense in ""victims of the floods"". The reference translation maintains a consistent tense throughout the sentence.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""Bangladeshis"" instead of ""Bangladeshis people"" or ""Bangladesh population"" which is more common and natural in English.
6. Grammar: The machine translation has a grammatical error in the phrase ""kutsus ta üles abistama"", it should be ""kutsus ta üles abistamine"" which is the correct Estonian grammar.
7. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation doesn't use idiomatic expressions like ""to call for assistance"" which is a common idiomatic expression in English.
8. Cultural references: The machine translation doesn't take into account the cultural context of the sentence, the phrase ""victims of the floods"" is more appropriate than ""victims of the floods in Bangladesh"".

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not of high quality and does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Estonian sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and natural translation of the Estonian sentence into English.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is different from the source text and reference translation in that it adds the word ""two"" to the phrase, which is not present in the original text. This suggests that the machine translation may not have fully captured the meaning of the source text.

2. The source text uses the word ""võimalikud"" which means ""possible."" The machine translation and reference translation both translate this word as ""two.""

Comparison:

* The source text uses the word ""võimalikud,"" which means ""possible."" The machine translation and reference translation both translate this word as ""two.""

Conclusion:
The machine translation and reference translation are the same in this case, as both translate the word ""võimalikud"" as ""two.""

3. The source text uses the word ""hoiakut,"" which means ""approaches."" The machine translation and reference translation both translate this word as ""approach.""

Comparison:

* The source text uses the word ""hoiakut,"" which means ""approaches."" The machine translation and reference translation both translate this word as ""approach.""

Conclusion:
The machine translation and reference translation are the same in this case, as both translate the word ""hoiakut"" as ""approach.""

Based on this analysis, it appears that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the source text. The machine translation adds an extra word (""two"") to the phrase, and also translates the word ""võimalikud"" as ""two"" instead of ""possible."" Additionally, both the machine translation and reference translation translate the word ""hoiakut"" as ""approach,"" which is the correct translation. However, the machine translation is not able to capture the nuances of the source text as well as the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""led"" (verb)
	* Reference translation: ""set off"" (verb)

The machine translation uses the verb ""led"" to indicate the movement of the military, while the reference translation uses ""set off"" to convey a more dynamic and action-packed meaning.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""in the hands of"" (preposition)
	* Reference translation: ""between"" (preposition)

The machine translation uses the preposition ""in the hands of"" to indicate the location of the French and Prussian troops, while the reference translation uses ""between"" to indicate the location of the scuffle.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""jalaväe kähmluse"" (Estonian idiom)
	* Reference translation: ""scuffle"" (English idiom)

The machine translation uses the Estonian idiom ""jalaväe kähmluse"", which doesn't have an direct English equivalent. The reference translation uses the English idiom ""scuffle"" to convey a similar meaning.

4. Tone:
	* Machine translation: neutral tone
	* Reference translation: more dynamic and action-packed tone

The machine translation maintains a neutral tone throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses more vivid language to convey the excitement and intensity of the situation.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation uses more idiomatic language and a more dynamic tone to convey the meaning of the original Estonian sentence. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses more formal language and a more neutral tone, which can make it sound less natural and less engaging to the reader.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""The Pasteur has shown that a whole dog who had been dried up and destroyed by a dead dog of rabies has not been infected with rabies."" (incorrect use of ""who"" instead of ""which"")
	* Reference translation: ""Pasteur showned that a healthy dog, who was injected with dried and milled spinal cord of a dog who died of rabies, was not infected with rabies."" (correct use of ""which"" to refer to the dog)
2. Word choice and terminology:
	* Machine translation: ""süstitud marutaudi"" (incorrect use of ""süstited"" instead of ""dried up"")
	* Reference translation: ""dried and milled spinal cord"" (correct use of ""milled"" to indicate the process of grinding)
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kellele oli süstitud marutaudi"" (incorrect use of ""kellele"" instead of ""a whole dog"")
	* Reference translation: ""a healthy dog"" (correct use of a general term to refer to a dog in a specific context)
4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone of the machine translation is more formal and academic, while the reference translation is more conversational and informal.
5. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation incorrectly states that the dog was ""not infected with rabies,"" while the reference translation correctly states that the dog was ""not infected with rabies.""

Overall, the machine translation contains several errors in grammar, word choice, and idiomatic expressions, which affect the accuracy and readability of the translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and idiomatic, and conveys the intended meaning of the original Estonian text more effectively.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Fatalisness"" is not a commonly used term in English, and it may not be immediately clear to readers what it means. A more common term in English for this concept is ""fatalism.""
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the term ""fatalism"" consistently throughout the text.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure in the machine translation is not entirely correct. The verb ""to be"" is in the present tense, but it should be in the past tense to match the time frame of the sentence.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the past tense consistently throughout the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The phrase ""mingit pistmist"" is not a commonly used idiomatic expression in English, and it may not be immediately clear to readers what it means. A more common idiomatic expression in English for this concept is ""a drop of time.""
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""a drop of time"" to convey the same meaning.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The phrase ""tõde"" in the machine translation could be translated as ""truth,"" but it also has connotations of ""fate"" or ""destiny"" in Estonian. The reference translation captures this nuance by using the phrase ""truth has nothing to do with the passing of time.""
	* Reference translation: The reference translation captures the cultural nuance of the Estonian phrase ""tõde,"" which carries a sense of inevitability or predetermination.
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation may not be as fluent or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The sentence structure and word choice may feel awkward or unnatural to English speakers.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation is more fluent and natural-sounding, with a more consistent sentence structure and word choice.

Overall, while the machine translation may be accurate in terms of the individual words and phrases used, it may not be as effective in conveying the nuances of the original Estonian text. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more fluent and natural-sounding, and captures the cultural nuances of the Estonian phrase more effectively.

	* Machine translation: ""paigutada"" (to place) vs. ""to have been placed"" (reference translation)
4. Tone:
	* Machine translation: uses a more formal tone vs. a more conversational tone in the reference translation

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The machine translation uses more formal language and awkward phrasing, which can make it harder to understand the intended meaning. In contrast, the reference translation uses more idiomatic expressions and a more conversational tone, which can make it easier to understand and more enjoyable to read.

Overall, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation. The machine translation has some errors in word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions, which can affect the overall clarity and naturalness of the translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""proposed to Wagner"" vs. Reference translation: ""proposed to Wagner""
		+ The machine translation uses the phrase ""proposed to Wagner"" which is more formal and less common in spoken Estonian. The reference translation uses the more common and informal ""proposed to Wagner"".
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""his fight group should have moved on to the city's shores"" vs. Reference translation: ""his fight group would have moved on in the city along the bank of Emajõgi""
		+ The machine translation uses the present perfect tense ""should have moved on"" which is less common in Estonian. The reference translation uses the past simple tense ""would have moved on"" which is more common in Estonian.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Alfons Rebane tegi Wagnerile ettepaneku"" vs. Reference translation: ""Alfons Rebane proposed to Wagner""
		+ The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, which is less common in Estonian. In Estonian, the subject usually comes before the verb.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: "" restricting the bridge's head"" vs. Reference translation: ""surrounding the bridgehead""
		+ The machine translation uses the phrase ""restricting the bridge's head"" which is less common in Estonian. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic ""surrounding the bridgehead"".

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""of the Power Left"" are placed at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, they are placed at the beginning.
2. Phrase structure: The machine translation has a different phrase structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""Second Livestock"" is translated as a single phrase, while in the reference translation, it is broken down into two separate phrases: ""Second"" and ""Livestock"".
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""Left"" instead of ""Livestock"" to translate the Estonian word ""maaker"". This is a significant difference, as ""maaker"" in Estonian refers to a specific type of animal, rather than a location.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the genitive case. This is a difference in grammar structure, as the machine translation uses the present tense to indicate the location of the creative cabin, while the reference translation uses the genitive case to indicate ownership.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""teine loomingumajake"" in the Estonian source text. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations may not always be able to capture the nuances of idiomatic expressions in the source language.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have significant differences in terms of word order, phrase structure, word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions. These differences suggest that the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the Estonian source text.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""tegelane"" (which means ""starts"") instead of the more common word ""alguses"" (which means ""begins"").
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the incorrect verb form in the first sentence, which is a common mistake in Estonian grammar. The correct verb form should be ""alguses esimeses lõigus öeldakse.""
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""esimeses lõigus"" (which means ""first time"") correctly. The reference translation uses the more common phrase ""esimeses kord"" (which means ""first time"").

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""mere fact"" instead of ""bare fact"" in the reference translation. While ""mere"" can also mean ""only,"" it has a slightly different connotation, implying that the fact is unadorned or uncomplicated. In contrast, ""bare"" emphasizes the simplicity and nakedness of the fact, without any additional embellishments.
2. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""kõrvale jätta"" (apart from cultural values), which is an idiomatic expression in Estonian. The reference translation uses the more literal phrase ""tõeseks vaid paljas fakt"" (apart from cultural values, only a bare fact remains true in history). While both phrases convey the same meaning, the machine translation may not be as idiomatic or natural-sounding in English.
3. Word order: In the machine translation, the phrase ""siis jääb ajaloos"" (only a mere fact remains true in history) is reversed compared to the reference translation. In Estonian, the word order is typically SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), but in the machine translation, it is SV (Subject-Verb-Object). This can make the sentence sound less natural in English.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the phrase ""jääb ajaloos"" (remains true). This may be a difference in translation strategy, as the machine translation may be more likely to use the present tense to convey a general or ongoing idea, while the reference translation may be more likely to use the past tense to convey a completed or historical idea.
5. Fluency: The machine translation may not be as fluent or natural-sounding as the reference translation, particularly in the phrase ""kõrvale jätta"" (apart from cultural values). This may be due to the limitations of machine translation algorithms, which can struggle with idiomatic expressions and subtle nuances of language.

Overall, while the machine translation is grammatically correct and conveys the basic meaning of the sentence, it may not be as idiomatic or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation is more fluent and conveys a more nuanced understanding of the Estonian language and culture.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

1. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""He was in office until 1889"" is moved to the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed at the beginning.
2. Tense: The machine translation changes the tense of the sentence from past to future. In the machine translation, ""was appointed"" is in the future tense, while in the reference translation, it is in the past tense.
3. Personal pronouns: The machine translation uses the personal pronoun ""he"" instead of ""Alfred Sharpe"" in the reference translation.
4. Punctuation: The machine translation adds a comma after ""1889"" in the reference translation, while the reference translation does not have any punctuation after the year.
5. Grammar: The machine translation changes the grammar of the sentence by adding a verb ""appointed"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense form of the verb ""appoint"" to match the tense of the rest of the sentence.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, tense, personal pronouns, punctuation, and grammar. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Science can dictate and change the way in which it works in some respects, but it cannot add value, so it is not a moral cry."" (incorrect use of ""dictate"" and ""add value"")
	* Reference translation: ""Science can guide morals and change its direction in some respects, but it cannot accommodate morals, and consequently, moral philosophy, either."" (correct use of ""guide"" and ""accommodate"")
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""moraali"" (Estonian for ""morals"") is translated as ""value"" in the machine translation, which is not the most accurate translation. In this context, ""moraali"" refers to ethical principles or moral standards.
	* Reference translation: ""moraalifilosoofiat"" (Estonian for ""moral philosophy"") is translated as ""moral philosophy"" in the reference translation, which is a more accurate translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""mahutada"" (Estonian for ""to add"") is not a common or idiomatic expression in English, and it does not convey the same meaning as ""add value"". A more idiomatic expression in English would be ""to enhance"" or ""to improve"".
	* Reference translation: ""soega ka mitte moraalifilosoofiat"" (Estonian for ""and consequently, moral philosophy, either"") is a more idiomatic expression in English, as it uses the phrase ""consequently,"".
4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation has a more formal and academic tone, which may not be suitable for all contexts. The reference translation has a more conversational and natural tone, which is more appropriate for everyday language use.

Overall, the machine translation has several errors and inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate, idiomatic, and natural-sounding in English. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further communication or publication.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""It forced the French out"" comes before ""and at about the same time,"" whereas in the reference translation, it's the other way around. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with word order and sentence structure.
2. Use of ""out"" vs. ""forced"": The machine translation uses the word ""out"" instead of ""forced"" in the first sentence. While ""out"" can be a valid translation of the Estonian word ""prantslased,"" it doesn't convey the same level of force or urgency as ""forced."" In the reference translation, the word ""forced"" is used to convey a stronger sense of urgency and action.
3. ""and"" vs. ""ja"": The machine translation uses the word ""and"" in both sentences, while the reference translation uses the Estonian word ""ja"" in the first sentence and the English word ""and"" in the second sentence. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall flow and readability of the translation.
4. ""Sokolnitzi"" vs. ""Sokolnitz"": The machine translation uses the spelling ""Sokolnitzi"" in the second sentence, while the reference translation uses ""Sokolnitz."" This is a more significant difference, as ""Sokolnitzi"" is not a valid Estonian word, and ""Sokolnitz"" is the correct spelling.
5. Grammar and syntax: The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the lack of a verb in the second sentence (""It forced the French out, and at about the same time it attacked...""). The reference translation corrects these errors and uses more complex sentence structures to convey the meaning more accurately.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. While machine translations can be useful for getting the general meaning of a text, they often struggle with nuances of language and cultural context, which can lead to inaccuracies and misunderstandings. Therefore, it's important to have a human translator review and edit machine-translated text to ensure that it meets the desired level of quality and accuracy.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""mainly targeted at foreign populations""
	* Reference translation: ""some mainly targeted at foreign populations""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""mainly targeted at foreign populations,"" while the reference translation uses ""some mainly targeted at foreign populations."" This difference may be due to the machine translation's tendency to oversimplify complex sentences or to prioritize brevity over accuracy.

2. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Osa neist on üleriigilised, osa regionaalsed, osa suunatud peamiselt välisriikide elanikkonnale.""
	* Reference translation: ""Some of them are nationwide, some regional, some mainly targeted at foreign populations.""

The machine translation keeps the word order of the Estonian sentence, while the reference translation rearranges the words to better convey the meaning in English. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations may not always prioritize the most natural word order in the target language.

3. Phrase structure:
	* Machine translation: ""osä neist on üleriigilised""
	* Reference translation: ""some of them are nationwide""

The machine translation omits the word ""osä"" (some) in the Estonian sentence, which is a common mistake in machine translations. The reference translation includes the word ""some"" to make the sentence clearer and more natural-sounding in English.

4. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""osä neist on üleriigilised, osa regionaalsed, osa suunatud peamiselt välisriikide elanikkonnale.""
	* Reference translation: ""Some of them are nationwide, some regional, some mainly targeted at foreign populations.""

The machine translation keeps the grammatical structure of the Estonian sentence, while the reference translation rephrases the sentence to better convey the meaning in English. For example, the machine translation uses the plural form of the verb ""to be"" (osä) to indicate that multiple things are being described, while the reference translation uses the singular form (some) to make the sentence clearer and more natural-sounding.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. While the machine translation captures some of the meaning of the Estonian sentence, it makes several errors in word choice, word order, phrase structure, and grammar. As a helpful assistant, I would recommend using a human translator for high-quality translations, rather than relying solely on machine translation.

5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""oli"" in the present tense, which is the correct form for the verb in Estonian. However, the reference translation uses the verb ""tunnetest"" in the past tense, which is the correct form for the verb in Estonian when referring to a past action.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. While it may be able to provide a basic understanding of the sentence, it lacks the nuance and detail that a human translator can provide.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation uses a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""the former prime minister and opposition leader"" is placed at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed at the beginning.
2. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""Benazir Bhutto,"" while the reference translation does not use any article.
3. Tense agreement: The machine translation uses the present tense ""have lifted"" to describe the action of lifting the house arrest, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""had lifted"" to describe the completed action.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""tühistasid"" (lifted) instead of ""kehtestatud"" (lifted) in the reference translation. ""Tühistasid"" is a more formal and literal translation of the English word ""lifted,"" while ""kehtestatud"" is a more idiomatic and natural-sounding translation in Estonian.
5. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a longer phrase structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence is structured as ""The Pakistani authorities have lifted the house arrest placed on the former prime minister and opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto,"" while in the reference translation, it is structured as ""The Pakistani authorities have lifted the house arrest placed on Benazir Bhutto.""
6. Grammar: The machine translation uses the passive voice in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the active voice. In the machine translation, the sentence is structured as ""The house arrest was lifted by the Pakistani authorities on Benazir Bhutto,"" while in the reference translation, it is structured as ""The Pakistani authorities lifted the house arrest on Benazir Bhutto.""

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word order, article usage, tense agreement, word choice, phrase structure, and grammar. The reference translation is generally more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Estonian, while the machine translation is more formal and literal.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""mässu õhutamises"" (incitement to riots)
	* Reference translation: ""inciting riots""
	
The machine translation uses the word ""õhutamises"" which is the Estonian word for ""riots"". However, the reference translation uses the more common English phrase ""inciting riots"".

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""neid mässu õhutamises"" (they are accused of incitement to riots)
	* Reference translation: ""they are accused of inciting riots""
	
The machine translation uses the genitive case ""neid"" to indicate possession, while the reference translation uses the direct object ""they"" to indicate the accused.

3. Spelling:

	* Reference translation: ""Rafael Correa"" (with an ""a"" in the first ""Rafael"")
	
The machine translation spells the name of the President differently than the reference translation.

4. Phrasing:
	* Machine translation: ""süüdistatakse"" (they are accused)
	* Reference translation: ""are accused""
	
The machine translation uses the verb ""süüdistatakse"" which is the Estonian verb for ""to be accused"", while the reference translation uses the more common English phrase ""are accused"".

5. Word order:

	* Reference translation: ""In the home country, they are accused of inciting riots""
	
The machine translation changes the word order to ""kodumaal süüdistatakse"", which means ""in the home country"" in Estonian, while the reference translation keeps the original word order.

1. Grammar and syntax:
The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the verb ""recognise"" (should be ""recognize"") and the lack of an article before ""hypothesis"". The reference translation, on the other hand, has correct grammar and syntax.
2. Vocabulary:
The machine translation uses the word ""hypothesis"" incorrectly. In this context, the Estonian word ""hüpotees"" means ""theory"" or ""hypothesis"", but the machine translation uses the word ""hypothesis"" directly, which is not accurate. The reference translation uses the correct word ""hüpotees"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""millega me võtame"" (which means ""we will discuss"") and translates it as ""we accept a certain proposition"". The reference translation captures this idiomatic expression correctly.
4. Cultural references:
The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the Estonian language and translates ""abduktsioon"" (which means ""deliberation"" or ""debate"") as "" Abdution"", which is not a correct translation.
5. Fluency and naturalness:
The machine translation sounds unnatural and lacks fluency, especially in the second sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, sounds more natural and fluent.

Based on these analyses, I would give the machine translation a score of 3/10 and the reference translation a score of 8/10.

This is a significant error, as the phrase ""mere thought"" is a common idiom in English that means ""just a thought"" or ""with no effort."" The reference translation correctly uses this idiomatic expression.
4. Cultural references:
The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the source text. The phrase ""maailmas olemasolevast"" is a reference to the Estonian proverb ""Maailm on olemasolevast,"" which means ""The world is not as it seems.""

	* Reference translation: ""The upper secondary school's"" (üldsekundäärne skooli)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the indefinite article ""a"" before ""school"", which is not necessary in English. The reference translation uses the definite article ""the"" to provide a more accurate and context-appropriate translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation differ in several aspects, including word choice, tense, word order, idioms and expressions, and grammar. The reference translation provides a more accurate and natural-sounding translation, while the machine translation has some errors and inaccuracies that can make it harder to understand the meaning.

Machine Translation: ""One option would also now be to deny that there is a requirement to merge at all.""

* The machine translation uses the word ""merge"" instead of ""love"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""merge"" has a different meaning than ""love"" in this context.
* The machine translation also uses the word ""now"" twice, which is unnecessary and can make the sentence sound repetitive.
* The sentence structure is also different in the machine translation, with the verb ""deny"" placed at the end of the sentence instead of in the middle.

Reference Translation: ""One option would also now be to deny that there is a requirement to love at all.""

* The reference translation uses the correct word ""love"" instead of ""merge"" in the machine translation.
* The sentence structure is also more natural and idiomatic in the reference translation, with the verb ""deny"" placed in the middle of the sentence.
* The use of ""now"" in the reference translation is also more appropriate, as it indicates that the option of denying the requirement to love is a current or present possibility.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The differences in word choice, sentence structure, and meaning make it clear that the machine translation is not a reliable or high-quality translation.

3. Word order: The machine translation moves the word ""self"" to the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation keeps it in the middle.
4. Idiomatic expression: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""based on qualities"" to convey the idea of love that is not just based on feelings, but also on the qualities of the person. The machine translation does not use this idiomatic expression.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses a more formal and literal translation of the Estonian sentence, while the reference translation uses a more natural and idiomatic English translation.

2. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""viia"" (meaning ""world"") is not a common word in Estonian, and it doesn't convey the same meaning as the reference translation's ""teleologically significant world"".
	* Reference translation: ""teleologically significant"" is a more formal and technical term in English, while the Estonian phrase ""teleoloogiliselt tähendusliku"" is more idiomatic and conveys a similar meaning.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kaotamine"" (meaning ""chaos"") is not a common idiomatic expression in Estonian, and it doesn't convey the same meaning as the reference translation's ""loss of a teleologically significant world"".
	* Reference translation: ""loss of a teleologically significant world"" is a more idiomatic expression in English, while the Estonian phrase ""kaotamine"" is more literal and doesn't convey the same nuance.
4. Cultural references:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""the independence of the courts"" is placed after the verb ""was declared,"" whereas in the reference translation, it is placed before the verb. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with word order and sentence structure.
2. Use of passive voice: The machine translation uses the passive voice in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the active voice. In the machine translation, ""the independence of the courts was declared"" is in the passive voice, while in the reference translation, ""four senior judges were declared"" is in the active voice. This difference can affect the clarity and naturalness of the translation.
3. Use of prepositions: The machine translation uses different prepositions than the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""of the courts"" is used after ""independence,"" while in the reference translation, ""of the office"" is used after ""judges."" This difference may be due to the machine translation's struggle to accurately convey the nuances of prepositional phrases.
4. Grammar and syntax: The machine translation has some grammatical errors that the reference translation does not have. For example, in the machine translation, the verb ""was declared"" is in the present tense, while in the reference translation, it is in the past tense. Additionally, the machine translation has a sentence fragment in the second sentence, which is not present in the reference translation.
5. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses some words that are not present in the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the word ""sobibatuks"" instead of ""sobibatuse,"" which is the Estonian word for ""judges."" This difference may be due to the machine translation's limited vocabulary or its inability to accurately convey the nuances of Estonian terminology.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have significant differences in terms of word order, use of passive voice, prepositions, grammar and syntax, and vocabulary. While the machine translation may be able to generate a rough translation of the sentence, it is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the primary source for Estonian-English translation.

5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""millega avaldati"" (to demonstrated) in the reference translation.
6. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the present tense for the verb ""toimus"" in the first sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""toimus"" in the second sentence.
7. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the word ""redundancies"" instead of ""ulatuslike koondamiste vastu"" (large-scale redundancies planned) in the reference translation.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Estonian language better, including the proper noun ""Prantsusmaal"", the consistent tense, and the idiomatic expressions.

5. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone is more formal and academic, while the reference translation is more conversational and informal.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation and the reference translation have different levels of quality. The machine translation has more errors and inaccuracies, and the language used is less natural and less idiomatic. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and natural-sounding, and it better conveys the intended meaning of the original text.

Overall, I would give the machine translation a lower rating (e.g. 3/5) and the reference translation a higher rating (e.g. 4.5/5).

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source Text: Fundamentaalseid printsiipe nimetas Lakatos uurimisprogrammi kõvaks tuumaks.
Machine Translation: The fundamental principles were described in Lakato as the core of the research programme.
Reference Translation: Lakatos called the fundamental principles the hard core of the research program.

Difference 1: Word order

The machine translation keeps the original word order of the source text, while the reference translation rearranges the words to better convey the meaning. In this case, the reference translation uses ""Lakatos called"" instead of ""The fundamental principles were described"" to emphasize the person responsible for the concept.

Difference 2: Use of ""as""

The machine translation uses ""as"" to indicate a comparison, while the reference translation omits it. In the source text, ""printsiipe"" (principles) is compared to ""kõvaks"" (programme), but the reference translation does not include this comparison.

Difference 3: Word choice

The machine translation uses ""core"" instead of ""hard core"" to translate ""kõvaks"". While both words can be translated as ""core"", ""hard core"" is a more idiomatic expression in English, and the reference translation captures this nuance better.

Difference 4: Grammar

The machine translation uses the present tense in ""The fundamental principles were described"", while the reference translation uses the past tense in ""Lakatos called"". This difference in verb tense is due to the different grammatical structures of the two languages.

Difference 5: Idiomatic expressions

The reference translation includes an idiomatic expression ""hard core"" to convey the idea that the fundamental principles are the essential part of the research program. The machine translation does not include this expression, which may make the translation sound less natural to an English speaker.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the source text more accurately and conveys the meaning more clearly in English.

The machine translation often uses less formal language and makes more mistakes in the translation, which can affect the overall quality of the translation.

Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating than the reference translation, perhaps a 3 or 4 out of 10.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the verb ""wash"" is placed after the noun ""hands,"" while in the reference translation, it is placed before the noun ""hands."" This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with word order and sentence structure.
2. Prepositions: The machine translation uses the preposition ""in"" to indicate the location where the hands are washed, while the reference translation uses the preposition ""in a shared bowl."" This difference may be due to the fact that the machine translation is not able to understand the context of the sentence and the meaning of the preposition ""in.""
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not translate the idiomatic expression ""süüakse käega"" correctly. The reference translation translates it as ""Nsima is eaten with hands,"" which is a more accurate translation of the original Estonian phrase. Machine translations often struggle with idiomatic expressions and cultural references, as they may not be able to understand the nuances of the language.
4. Grammar: The machine translation has a grammatical error in the sentence. The verb ""are cooked"" should be in the plural form ""are cooked"" instead of ""are cooked with their hands."" This is a common error in machine translations, as they may not be able to correctly identify the subject-verb agreement in a sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, prepositions, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. While machine translations can be useful for getting the general meaning of a sentence, they often struggle with the nuances of language and cultural references, which can lead to inaccuracies and misunderstandings. Therefore, it is important to use reference translations as a basis for checking the accuracy of machine translations.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Grammar and syntax:
The machine translation and reference translation have the same grammatical structure and sentence structure. Both sentences are in the active voice and have the same word order. Therefore, there is no difference in this aspect.
2. Vocabulary:
The machine translation uses more formal and literal translations of words, while the reference translation uses more idiomatic and natural-sounding expressions. For example, the machine translation uses ""decisive and profound difference"" instead of ""significant and profound difference"" used in the reference translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the source text. For example, the phrase ""armastuse objekti loomust"" in the source text is not translated literally in the machine translation, but rather as ""the nature of the object of love"" which sounds less natural in English. In contrast, the reference translation captures the idiomatic expression ""armastuse objekti loomust"" and translates it as ""the nature of the object of love"" which sounds more natural in English.
4. Cultural references:
The machine translation does not take into account cultural references and nuances, while the reference translation does. For example, the phrase ""armastuse objekti loomust"" in the source text is a cultural reference to a traditional Estonian love song, which is not translated in the machine translation. In contrast, the reference translation captures this cultural reference and translates it as ""the nature of the object of love"" which is more appropriate for an English-speaking audience.
5. Fluency and readability:
The reference translation is more fluent and readable than the machine translation. The machine translation uses more formal and literal translations of words, which can make it sound less natural and less fluent in English. In contrast, the reference translation uses more idiomatic and natural-sounding expressions, which makes it sound more fluent and easier to read in English.

Based on these analyses, it is clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the source text better, including idiomatic expressions, cultural references, and fluency. The machine translation, on the other hand, is more literal and less natural-sounding in English.

2. Word order: In the machine translation, the words ""our children"" are placed after the verb ""are"" instead of before it, as in the reference translation. This can change the emphasis of the sentence slightly.
3. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a longer phrase ""our home country or our personal ambitions"" instead of the shorter phrase ""homeland"" in the reference translation. This can affect the flow of the sentence and the way the reader processes the information.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""seems different"" instead of the more idiomatic ""seems to be different"" in the reference translation. This can affect the naturalness and fluency of the translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the present and past tenses to convey the different aspects of the situation. This can affect the way the sentence is perceived by the reader.

Overall, while the machine translation is generally understandable, there are some differences in word choice, phrase structure, and idiomatic expressions that can affect the quality of the translation.

The machine translation uses the present tense to translate the Estonian sentence, which is in the past tense. This is a more significant error, as it affects the time frame in which the actions are taking place.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""new storms and wind flags were made""
	* Reference translation: ""new towers and vanes were made""
	
The machine translation changes the word order of the Estonian sentence, placing ""storms"" and ""wind flags"" before ""were made."" In the reference translation, the word order is reversed, with ""towers"" and ""vane"" appearing before ""were made."" This difference in word order can affect the clarity and flow of the translation.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""new storms and wind flags""
	* Reference translation: ""new towers and vanes""
	
The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression used in the Estonian sentence, which refers to the making of new towers and vanes. This can result in a less natural-sounding translation.
5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Uue torni ja tuulelipu tegemisel peeti neid vigu silmas""
	* Reference translation: ""Uue torni ja tuulelipu tegemisel peetsi neid vigu silmas""
	
The machine translation uses the accusative case for the noun ""torni"" (""tower""), while the reference translation uses the genitive case (""peetsi""). Additionally, the machine translation omits the word ""neid"" (""those""), which is present in the reference translation. These errors can affect the accuracy and clarity of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation contains several errors that can affect the quality of the translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and natural-sounding translation of the Estonian sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""dramatic situation"" (machine translation) vs. ""tense situation"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: The machine translation uses the word ""dramatic"" to convey a sense of urgency and excitement, while the reference translation uses ""tense situation"" to convey a sense of tension and uncertainty.
2. Verb tense consistency:
	* Machine translation: ""sent"" (machine translation) vs. ""sent"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: Both the machine translation and the reference translation use the past tense of the verb ""send"", but the machine translation uses the same verb form twice in a row, which can make the sentence sound repetitive and less natural.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""when Napoleon saatis ekspeditsiooniväed purustama Haiti revolutsiooni"" (machine translation) vs. ""when Napoleon sent the expeditionary forces to break the revolution in Haiti"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, placing the subject ""Napoleon"" before the verb ""sent"", while the reference translation places the verb ""sent"" before the subject ""Napoleon"". This can make the sentence sound less natural and more awkward.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""ekspeditsiooniväed"" (machine translation) vs. ""expeditionary forces"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""ekspeditsiooniväed"", which doesn't have an exact English equivalent. The reference translation uses the phrase ""expeditionary forces"", which is a more common and idiomatic way to express this idea in English.
5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""purustama"" (machine translation) vs. ""broke"" (reference translation)
	* Reason: The machine translation uses the Estonian verb ""purustama"", which means ""to break"", but in this context, it doesn't convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The reference translation uses the verb ""broke"" to indicate that Napoleon's expeditionary forces successfully broke the revolution in Haiti.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, verb tense consistency, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. While the machine translation conveys the basic meaning of the sentence, it doesn't always use the most natural or idiomatic English expressions, which can make it sound less fluent and less accurate.

Reference Translation:

* ""In turn , the parish government applied to the police to check the charges.""

Differences:

1. Use of ""government of the government"" vs. ""parish government"": The machine translation uses the phrase ""government of the government,"" which is not a correct or idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic phrase ""parish government.""
2. Use of ""to check the charges"": The machine translation uses the phrase ""to check the charges,"" which is a more formal and literal translation of the Estonian phrase. However, the reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic phrase ""to check the charges.""

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and conveys the meaning of the Estonian sentence more clearly and naturally in English.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""mandate"" (UPM)
	* Reference translation: ""League of Nations""

The machine translation uses the term ""UPM"" instead of ""League of Nations"". This is a clear difference, as ""UPM"" is not a commonly used term in English to refer to the League of Nations. The reference translation uses the more widely recognized term ""League of Nations"".

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Iraq, which joined in 1932, was the first Member State to have been the mandate of the UPM.""
	* Reference translation: ""Iraq, which joined in 1932, was the first member state that had been a mandate territory of the League of Nations.""

The machine translation uses the present perfect tense (""had been"") to indicate that Iraq was a mandate territory at some point in the past, while the reference translation uses the past simple tense (""was"") to indicate that Iraq was a mandate territory at a specific point in time (1932).

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Iraq, which joined in 1932, was the first Member State to have been the mandate of the UPM.""
	* Reference translation: ""Iraq, which joined in 1932, was the first member state that had been a mandate territory of the League of Nations.""

The machine translation uses a different word order than the reference translation. The reference translation places the word ""first"" before the verb ""had been"", while the machine translation places it after the verb.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""mandate of the UPM""
	* Reference translation: ""mandate territory of the League of Nations""

The machine translation uses the term ""mandate of the UPM"", which is not a commonly used idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more widely recognized term ""mandate territory of the League of Nations"".

Overall, the machine translation contains several differences compared to the reference translation, including word choice, grammar, word order, and idiomatic expressions. These differences suggest that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""as it views it"" (MT) vs. ""because reason connects it"" (RT)

4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone and style of the machine translation are more formal and literal, while the reference translation is more conversational and idiomatic.

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.

The machine translation uses the passive voice ""must aim"" instead of the active voice ""believes"" in the reference translation. Additionally, the machine translation adds unnecessary words ""more closely"" and ""through negotiation"" which are not present in the reference translation.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""leviku peatamist"" (uprising)
	* Reference translation: ""uprising""

The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""leviku peatamist"" which means ""rebellion"" or ""uprising"", while the reference translation uses the English word ""uprising"" directly.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""võitmist vägede kogumiseks"" (to gain time through negotiation)
	* Reference translation: ""to gain time through negotiation""

The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""võitmist vägede kogumiseks"" which means ""to gain time through negotiation"", while the reference translation uses the simpler English phrase ""to gain time through negotiation"".

4. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""ta"" (to)
	* Reference translation: ""he"" (he believes)

The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""ta"" (to) instead of the personal pronoun ""he"" in the reference translation.

5. Sentence structure:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""practices"" (mingi praktika) is translated as ""it gives"" (see tahes). This is a significant difference, as ""practices"" in the source text refers to the actions or activities being described, while ""it gives"" is a verb that implies a more abstract or intangible concept.
	* Reference translation: ""practices"" is correctly translated as ""practices"" (mingi praktika) in the reference translation.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure in the machine translation is different from the source text. In the source text, the sentence is structured as a complex sentence with a subordinate clause, while in the machine translation, it is structured as a simple sentence with a subject-verb-object word order.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the same sentence structure as the source text, with a complex sentence that includes a subordinate clause.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""on tugevam kui mis tahes põhjend"" (which means ""as strong as the reason for doing so""). This expression is not directly translatable, and the machine translation does not provide a suitable equivalent.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation captures the idiomatic expression correctly, using the phrase ""the reason it gives"" to convey the intended meaning.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the phrase ""mingi praktika,"" which in Estonian refers to a specific type of folk healing practice. The machine translation does not provide a suitable equivalent for this term.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation captures the cultural context of the phrase correctly, using the term ""folk healing practices"" to convey the intended meaning.

Overall, the machine translation falls short in capturing the nuances of the source text, particularly in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Estonian text.

		+ The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""See ebaõnnestub,"" which is a more literal translation of the English sentence. However, the reference translation rephrases the sentence to make it more clear and natural in English.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, tense consistency, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. While the machine translation is mostly accurate, there are some areas where it could be improved, such as using more idiomatic expressions and rephrasing the sentence for better clarity and naturalness in English.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""In 1265"" are placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, they are placed after the names of the places.
2. Names of places: The machine translation has different names for some of the places mentioned in the source text. For example, the machine translation calls the place ""Caesarea"" while the reference translation calls it ""Caesarea, Haifa and Arsuf"". Similarly, the machine translation calls ""Safad"" while the reference translation calls it ""Safadi"".
3. Tense: The machine translation is in the past tense, while the reference translation is in the present tense. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle to convey the nuances of tense and aspect in languages.
4. Grammar: The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the plural form of the verb ""were"" in the sentence ""In 1265, Baibars Caesarea, Haifa and Arsufi were seized"". In the reference translation, the verb is in the singular form, which is more accurate.
5. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses some words that are not commonly used in English, such as ""seized"" instead of ""occupied"". This can make the translation sound less natural and less accurate.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, names of places, tense, grammar, and vocabulary. The reference translation is more faithful to the original source text and conveys the meaning more clearly.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""Andrus Ansip alustas"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed after ""Eesti peaminister"". This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with word order and sentence structure.
2. Article usage: In the machine translation, the definite article ""the"" is used before ""United States"", while in the reference translation, it is not used. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Names: The machine translation has a slight difference in the spelling of the names ""Andrus Ansip"" and ""Richard Cheney"". In the machine translation, the name ""Andrus"" is spelled with an ""s"", while in the reference translation, it is spelled with a ""c"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the accuracy of the translation.
4. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense for the verb ""meeting"", while the reference translation uses the past tense. This is a difference in verb tense, which can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""alustas"" (began) instead of ""käivitas"" (began) in the reference translation. This is a difference in word choice, which can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
6. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a different phrase structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""among others"" is separated from the verb ""meeting"" with a comma, while in the reference translation, it is not. This is a difference in phrase structure, which can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have several differences in word order, article usage, names, tense, word choice, and phrase structure. These differences can affect the accuracy and fluency of the translation, and they highlight the limitations of machine translation compared to human translation.

1. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, moving ""where there were Hutu refugees"" to the end of the sentence. In the reference translation, the word order is maintained, with ""where the Hutu escaped"" coming after ""initially invaded"".
2. Phrase structure: The machine translation breaks up the long phrase ""kust hutud põgenesid Tansaaniasse"" into two separate phrases: ""kust hutud põgenes"" and ""Tansaaniasse"". In the reference translation, the phrase is kept intact.
3. Tense: The machine translation changes the tense of the sentence, shifting from the past tense (""invaded"") to the present tense (""invade""). In the reference translation, the tense is maintained, using the past tense (""invaded"").
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""refugees"" instead of the more specific ""Hutu refugees"". While ""refugees"" is a valid translation of the Estonian word ""põgened"", it doesn't convey the same level of specificity as ""Hutu refugees"".
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""to Tanzania"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""escaped to Tanzania"").

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, phrase structure, tense, word choice, and grammar. While the machine translation is understandable, it lacks the nuance and precision of the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and tone. Here are some areas where the machine translation could be improved:

1. Word choice: The machine translation could have used more idiomatic expressions, such as ""status symbols"" instead of ""surroundings of status.""
2. Grammar: The machine translation could have used more accurate verb forms, such as ""grow"" instead of ""growing.""
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation could have used more idiomatic expressions, such as ""consider them to be status symbols"" instead of ""consider them to be surroundings of status.""
4. Tone: The machine translation could have conveyed a more appropriate tone, such as ""reluctant to slaughter"" instead of ""are not happy to kill.""

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. However, it's important to note that machine translation is a complex task and can be challenging to produce high-quality translations, especially for languages with complex grammar and syntax rules like Estonian.

Machine Translation:

* ""Namely-right 175px"" instead of ""Grand Duchy of Lithuania"" in the first sentence.

Reference Translation:

* ""Grand Duchy of Lithuania"" instead of ""Lithuanian current"" in the first sentence.
* ""Grand Principality of Lithuania"" instead of ""Lithuanian current"" in the second sentence.

Comparison:

* The machine translation uses the term ""Lithuanian current"" instead of ""Grand Duchy of Lithuania"" in both sentences, which is not accurate. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania was a historical state that existed from the 13th to the 18th century, while ""Lithuanian current"" refers to the modern-day Republic of Lithuania.
* The machine translation also uses the term ""Namely-right 175px"" instead of ""Grand Principality of Lithuania"" in the first sentence, which is not a correct translation of the original text.

Conclusion:

Based on the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation, it is clear that the machine translation is not accurate in its translation of the Estonian text. The machine translation uses incorrect terminology and misunderstands the context of the text. Therefore, I would not recommend using the machine translation for any important or professional purposes.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""tailored"" instead of ""tailored to"" in the reference translation. ""Tailored"" is a more formal and technical term, while ""tailored to"" is a more common and idiomatic way to express the idea.
2. Word order: In the machine translation, the phrase ""so people need less to adapt to computers"" is placed at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed after the verb ""need"". This slight difference in word order can affect the overall flow and clarity of the sentence.
3. Phrasing: The machine translation uses the phrase ""on vähem tarvis arvutitega kohaneda"" (on less effort to adapt to computers), while the reference translation uses ""arvutitega kohaneda"" (to computers). The reference translation uses a more literal translation of the Estonian phrase, while the machine translation uses a more idiomatic English phrase.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the present continuous tense (""are more tailored...""). This difference in verb tense can affect the overall meaning and nuance of the sentence.
5. Idioms and expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""computer operations"", while the reference translation uses ""computers"". This difference in phrasing can affect the overall meaning and nuance of the sentence, as ""computer operations"" is a more technical term, while ""computers"" is a more common and everyday term.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, word order, phrasing, grammar, and idioms. While the machine translation is generally understandable, there are some areas where it could be improved to better convey the intended meaning and nuance of the Estonian original.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""It is difficult to say that alternative medicine here cannot be produced by knowledge unless there is a theory about what takes scientific findings into account.""
	* Reference translation: ""It is difficult to say that alternative medicine cannot produce knowledge , if there is no theory about what turns scientific findings into knowledge.""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""takes scientific findings into account,"" while the reference translation uses ""turns scientific findings into knowledge."" The reference translation is more accurate, as ""turns into knowledge"" is a more idiomatic expression in English.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""et alternatiivmeditsiin ei saa toota teadmist""
	* Reference translation: ""It is difficult to say that alternative medicine cannot produce knowledge""

The machine translation uses the verb ""saa"" (can) in the sentence, while the reference translation uses ""say"" (difficult to say). The reference translation is more accurate, as ""say"" is a more common and idiomatic verb in English.

3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""teooriat selle kohta""
	* Reference translation: ""what turns scientific findings into knowledge""

The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""teooriat selle kohta,"" which doesn't have a direct English equivalent. The reference translation uses the phrase ""what turns scientific findings into knowledge,"" which is a more common and idiomatic expression in English.

4. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation produces a sentence that is grammatically correct but sounds a bit stilted and unnatural in English.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation produces a sentence that is more fluent and natural-sounding in English.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more idiomatic expressions and grammar, and the sentence flows better in English.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Today, it is only the first order of the city.""
	* Reference translation: ""Today, only the first floor of the fortress remains.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""order"" instead of ""floor"". This is a common mistake in machine translations, as they often struggle to understand the nuances of language and may replace words with incorrect synonyms.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Today, it is only the first order of the city.""
	* Reference translation: ""Today, only the first floor of the fortress remains.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the wrong grammatical structure in the sentence. In Estonian, the sentence should be in the genitive case, which is indicated by the word ""of"" in the reference translation. The machine translation, however, uses the nominative case, which is indicated by the word ""it"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Today, it is only the first order of the city.""
	* Reference translation: ""Today, only the first floor of the fortress remains.""
	* Difference: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression used in the reference translation. In Estonian, the phrase ""linnusest alles vaid esimene korrus"" means ""of the fortress remains only the first floor"", which is a common idiomatic expression used to describe a specific part of a building. The machine translation does not understand this expression and replaces it with a literal translation of ""order"".
4. Context:
	* Machine translation: ""Today, it is only the first order of the city.""
	* Reference translation: ""Today, only the first floor of the fortress remains.""
	* Difference: The machine translation does not take into account the context of the sentence. The sentence is part of a larger text that describes the current state of a fortress, and the reference translation reflects this context by using the phrase ""of the fortress remains"". The machine translation, on the other hand, treats the sentence as a standalone phrase and does not consider the broader context.

Overall, the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation in this case. The machine translation makes several errors in word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and context, which result in an inaccurate and less natural-sounding translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Gruusias"" (Georgia) is translated as ""Georgia"" in the reference translation.

	* Machine translation: ""kaitsejõudude"" (borders of power) is translated as ""power"" in the reference translation.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is different in the two translations. The machine translation has a more complex sentence structure with multiple clauses, while the reference translation has a simpler sentence structure with a single main clause.
	* Machine translation: The verb tense is different in the two translations. The machine translation uses the past tense (""was arrested"") while the reference translation uses the present tense (""acting in excess of his powers"").
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""ületamises"" (excess of powers), which is included in the reference translation.
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""kahtlustus"" (suspicion) as ""suspicion"" in the reference translation.

Based on these differences, it appears that the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Estonian text better, including the use of the idiomatic expression ""ületamises"" and the correct verb tense for the verb ""acting"". The machine translation, on the other hand, makes some errors in word choice and grammar, which can affect the overall accuracy of the translation.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation uses more informal language and word choices, and the grammar and phrasing are not as natural-sounding. Additionally, the machine translation omits the word ""and"" in the second sentence, which can make the sentence structure less clear. Overall, the reference translation is more polished and professional-sounding, while the machine translation is more rough and informal.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""The disease from Darwin was never fully diagnosed"" - The sentence structure is incorrect, and ""from Darwin"" should be in the genitive case.
	* Reference translation: ""The disease that Darwin suffered from was never fully diagnosed"" - The sentence structure is correct, and ""suffered from"" is in the correct case.
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""ei osatud"" (never fully diagnosed) - The word ""osatud"" is not a word in English, and the correct word is ""diagnosed"".
	* Reference translation: ""no attempt to cure it was very successful"" - The word ""cure"" is not the best translation for ""panna"" in this context, as ""panna"" means ""diagnosis"" or ""diagnose"". A more accurate translation would be ""no attempt to diagnose it was very successful"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""katse seda ravida polnud"" - The phrase ""katse seda ravida"" is not a common or idiomatic expression in English, and the correct phrase would be ""no attempt to cure it was successful"".
	* Reference translation: ""no attempt to diagnose it was particularly successful"" - The phrase ""particularly successful"" is a more accurate translation of ""kuigi edukas"" in this context, as it conveys a more nuanced meaning.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""Darwini poolt"" - The term ""Darwini poolt"" is not a commonly used term in English, and the correct term is ""Darwin's disease"".
	* Reference translation: ""Darwin's disease"" - This term is more accurate and culturally relevant, as it refers to the specific disease that Charles Darwin suffered from.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of grammar, vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. The reference translation provides a more nuanced and culturally relevant translation of the original Estonian text.

Machine Translation:

* The author, Ene Mikkelson, was awarded the prize for the 'Katkuhaud'.

Reference Translation:

* The writer, Ene Mikkelson, was awarded the prize for the novel 'Katkuhaud'.

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, the phrase ""Preemia pälvis kirjanik"" is translated as ""The author,"" which is a bit awkward and doesn't convey the same level of respect as the reference translation. In Estonian, ""pälvis"" means ""writer,"" so it would be more accurate to translate it as ""The writer.""
2. In the machine translation, the word ""Katkuhaud"" is translated as ""the 'Katkuhaud'"", which is unnecessary and makes the sentence longer than it needs to be. In Estonian, the word ""Katkuhaud"" is a proper noun, so it should be translated as a proper noun without the quotes.
3. In the machine translation, the verb tense is inconsistent. The sentence starts in the present tense with ""was awarded,"" but then switches to the past tense with ""the prize."" To maintain consistency, it would be better to translate it as ""The writer, Ene Mikkelson, was awarded the prize for the novel 'Katkuhaud'.""

Overall, the machine translation is not very accurate and lacks nuance, especially when it comes to the use of proper nouns and verb tense consistency. The reference translation is more precise and captures the nuances of the original Estonian sentence better.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Egena"" (in the source) is translated as ""one of the main preoccupations"" (in the machine translation). However, the reference translation uses ""one of the main contenders"" to better convey the meaning of the original sentence.
2. Grammar:

	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the past tense (""was"") to translate the verb ""kujunenud"", which is more accurate.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""Saksa ordu"" (in the source), which means ""the German Order"". A more accurate translation would be ""the Teutonic Order"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""Livimaa haru"" (in the source), which means ""the Livonian branch"".
4. Names and places:

4. Name translation: The machine translation translates ""Paavst"" as ""Pope"", while the reference translation translates it as ""The Pope"".
5. Location translation: The machine translation translates ""Keenia"" as ""Kenya"", while the reference translation translates it as ""Kenyan Hindus"".

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""markers"" instead of ""Marxists"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly. In the context of the sentence, ""markers"" could refer to any group of people who are marking or evaluating something, whereas ""Marxists"" specifically refers to a political ideology.
2. Tone: The machine translation has a more neutral tone, while the reference translation has a slightly more positive tone. This is because the reference translation uses the word ""only"" to emphasize that highly optimistic Marxists are the only ones who trust the materialistic version, which implies a more positive assessment of the translation.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the phrase ""who are in favour of its materialistic version."" This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""mainly trusted,"" which is a more formal and literal translation of the Estonian phrase ""peamiselt ainult äärmiselt."" In contrast, the reference translation uses the more idiomatic expression ""highly optimistic Marxists.""
5. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, placing the verb ""trusted"" after the subject ""It."" In the reference translation, the word order is more typical of English, with the verb ""are"" appearing before the subject ""highly optimistic Marxists.""

Overall, the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are relatively minor, but they do affect the overall meaning and tone of the sentence. The reference translation is more idiomatic and conveys a more positive assessment of the translation, while the machine translation is more neutral and literal.

In the reference translation, the sentence is structured as ""The women of three different generations are having serious talk."" which is more clear and concise.
* There are several grammar mistakes in the machine translation. For example, ""erineva"" should be ""three different generations"" in English. Additionally, ""naised"" should be ""women"" in English.
* The word choice is not accurate in the machine translation. In the machine translation, ""maha"" is used instead of ""serious talk"". ""Maha"" means ""big"" in Estonian, so it doesn't make sense in this context. In the reference translation, ""serious talk"" is used, which is a more accurate translation of the Estonian phrase ""tõsise jutuajamine"".

Reference Translation:

The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses idiomatic expressions such as ""hope"" and ""lootnud"" to convey the intended meaning.

5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: does not take cultural references into account
	* Reference translation: takes cultural references into account

The machine translation does not take cultural references into account, while the reference translation acknowledges the cultural context of the original Estonian sentence, using the phrase ""Aino oleks lootnud"" which is a more appropriate way to express the idea in English.

Based on these differences, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as moderate, while the reference translation is of high quality. The reference translation provides a more accurate and nuanced translation of the original Estonian sentence, taking into account cultural references and using idiomatic expressions.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""The Roma estimate that it would take ten years to build the Hyperlop between San Francisco and Los Eliles."" (incorrect use of ""Roma"" instead of ""Musk"")
	* Reference translation: ""Musk estimated that it would take ten years to build a Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles."" (correct use of ""Musk"")
2. Word choice and terminology:
	* Machine translation: ""Hyperlop"" instead of ""Hyperloop"" (incorrect term)
	* Reference translation: ""Hyperloop"" (correct term)
3. Punctuation and capitalization:
	* Machine translation: no punctuation after ""San Francisco"" and ""Los Eliles"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: punctuation after ""San Francisco"" and ""Los Angeles"" (correct)
4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: the tone is more formal and distant, while the reference translation is more conversational and friendly
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: no idiomatic expressions (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""ten years"" (correct idiomatic expression)

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, word choice, and punctuation, which can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and natural-sounding, with proper grammar, word choice, and punctuation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""irrespective of race and sex"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses ""irrespective of race and sex"" in the first instance and ""irrespective of race, sex"" in the second instance. This difference in wording may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does show a slight variation in the way the phrase is phrased.
2. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include any punctuation after the word ""sex"" in the second instance, while the reference translation includes a comma after ""sex"". This may make the sentence slightly harder to read and understand, as the comma helps to separate the two clauses of the sentence.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in both instances, while the reference translation uses the present tense in the first instance and the past tense in the second instance. This difference in verb tense may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does show a slight variation in the way the sentence is structured.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions in either instance, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""are equal"" in both instances. This difference in language use may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does show a slight variation in the way the sentence is phrased.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation does not include any cultural references, while the reference translation includes a cultural reference to the phrase ""all people, irrespective of race and sex, are equal"" which is a common phrase used in many cultures. This difference in cultural reference may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does show a slight variation in the way the sentence is phrased.

Overall, the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are relatively minor and do not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence. However, the reference translation does provide a more nuanced and culturally appropriate phrasing of the sentence, which may be important for conveying the intended meaning in certain contexts.

2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense consistently throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the present tense for the first part of the sentence (""On 31 March"") and the past tense for the second part of the sentence (""stopped registering..."").
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""filiaal"" instead of ""branch"" in the reference translation. This may be due to a difference in terminology or style guides.
4. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a more literal translation of the Estonian sentence, while the reference translation uses a more idiomatic and fluent English sentence structure. For example, the machine translation uses the phrase ""uute klientide registreerimise"" (new customers' registration), while the reference translation uses the phrase ""opening deposits"".
5. Grammar: The machine translation has a few grammatical errors, such as the use of the singular verb ""stopped"" instead of the plural verb ""stopped"".

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation.

Step 1: Identify the differences between the source text and the machine translation.

The source text is: ""Alates 1960ndatest sai tavaliseks järeldada, et adekvaatsem teaduse teooria peab lähtuma teoreetilise raamistiku mõistmisest.""

The machine translation is: ""Since the 1960s, it was common practice to conclude that a more adequate scientific theory must be based on an understanding of the theoretical framework.""

The differences between the two are:

* In the source text, the word ""tavaliseks"" is translated as ""since"" in the machine translation, but it could be translated as ""from that time"" or ""from the 1960s"" to provide more context.
* In the machine translation, the phrase ""adekvaatsem teaduse teooria"" is translated as ""a more adequate scientific theory"", but it could be translated as ""a more advanced scientific theory"" or ""a more sophisticated scientific theory"" to better convey the meaning.
* In the machine translation, the phrase ""peab lähtuma teoreetilise raamistiku mõistmisest"" is translated as ""must be based on an understanding of the theoretical framework"", but it could be translated as ""must be grounded in theoretical frameworks"" or ""must be based on a thorough understanding of theoretical frameworks"" to provide more clarity.

Step 2: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Based on the differences identified in Step 1, the machine translation could be improved in several areas:

* Contextualization: The machine translation could provide more context for the word ""tavaliseks"" to help the reader understand the time period being referred to.
* Clarity: The machine translation could be clearer in conveying the meaning of ""adekvaatsem teaduse teooria"" by using a more precise term such as ""a more advanced scientific theory"".
* Accuracy: The machine translation could be more accurate in translating ""peab lähtuma teoreetilise raamistiku mõistmisest"" by using the phrase ""must be grounded in theoretical frameworks"" instead of ""must be based on an understanding of the theoretical framework"".

Overall, the machine translation could benefit from more contextualization, clarity, and accuracy in conveying the meaning of the source text.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.

The reference translation is: ""Since the 1960s, it was common practice to conclude that a more adequate scientific theory must be based on an understanding of the theoretical framework.""

The reference translation is more accurate and clear than the machine translation in several areas:

* Contextualization: The reference translation provides more context for the word ""tavaliseks"" by specifying the time period being referred to.
* Clarity: The reference translation is clearer in conveying the meaning of ""adekvaatsem teaduse teooria"" by using a more precise term such as ""a more adequate scientific theory"".
* Accuracy: The reference translation is more accurate in translating ""peab lähtuma teoreetilise raamistiku mõistmisest"" by using the phrase ""must be based on an understanding of the theoretical framework"" instead of ""must be grounded in theoretical frameworks"".

Overall, the reference translation is a more accurate and clear translation of the source text than the machine translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""cross-border"" instead of ""beyond empirical definitions."" While ""cross-border"" can be a valid translation of the Estonian phrase ""teispool empiirilisi määratlusi,"" it doesn't quite convey the same meaning as ""beyond empirical definitions.""
2. Idiomatic expression: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""beyond empirical definitions"" to convey the idea that something is not limited or defined by empirical data or observations. The machine translation doesn't quite capture this nuance, as ""cross-border"" is more of a geographical term than a philosophical or conceptual one.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""must"" in the imperative mood, while the reference translation uses the verb ""must"" in the indicative mood. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and naturalness of the translation.

Overall, while the machine translation is grammatically correct, it doesn't quite capture the nuances of the original Estonian sentence in the same way as the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and conveys the intended meaning more clearly.

2. Punctuation: The machine translation adds a comma after ""Finland"" in the phrase ""the prime ministers of the United Kingdom, the Nordic countries and the Baltic States met,"" which is not present in the reference translation.
3. Accuracy of translation: The machine translation gets the name of the city wrong, translating it as ""Espos"" instead of ""Espoo."" The correct translation of the Estonian name ""Espoo"" is ""Esbo"" in English.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense for the verb ""met,"" whereas the reference translation uses the past tense to indicate that the meeting took place in the past.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""the prime ministers of the United Kingdom, the Nordic countries and the Baltic States"" in the same way as the reference translation does.

	* Reference translation: ""it is somehow perceived, experienced""

The machine translation uses the present continuous tense (""is being pushed through"") instead of the present simple tense (""is perceived, experienced"") in the reference translation. This makes the sentence sound less natural and less accurate.

3. Idiomatic expressions:

* ""kõneisik"" should be ""spoke"" instead of ""President Obama"" (the correct translation of the verb ""kõneisik"" is ""spoke"")
* ""lükkas"" should be ""accusations"" instead of ""these accusations"" (the correct translation of the noun ""lükkas"" is ""accusations"")
* ""süüdistused"" should be ""rejected"" instead of ""reject these accusations"" (the correct translation of the verb ""süüdistused"" is ""rejected"")

Reference Translation: President Obama 's spokesman rejected these accusations.

* The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation.
* The machine translation makes a few minor errors in word choice and grammar, but overall the reference translation is more fluent and natural-sounding in Estonian.

Overall, the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation, and it better conveys the intended meaning of the original sentence in Estonian.

Machine Translation:

* ""After almost a week of recess"" is translated as ""Õnnetuspaigal viibis pärast ligi nädalast vaheaega""
* ""OSCE vaatlejate rühm"" is translated as ""the group of OSCE observers""
* ""was also present after the accident"" is translated as ""vaheaega ka OSCE vaatlejate rühm""

Reference Translation:

* ""After almost a week of recess"" is translated as ""After almost a week of recess"" (no change)
* ""OSCE vaatlejate rühm"" is translated as ""the group of OSCE observers"" (no change)
* ""was also present at the accident site"" is translated as ""was also present at the accident site"" (no change)

Comparison:

* The machine translation uses the phrase ""pärast ligi nädalast vaheaega"" which is a literal translation of ""after almost a week of recess"", but it sounds unnatural in English. A more natural way to translate this phrase would be ""after almost a week of recess"".
* The machine translation uses the phrase ""OSCE vaatlejate rühm"" which is a literal translation of ""the group of OSCE observers"", but it sounds unnatural in English. A more natural way to translate this phrase would be ""the group of OSCE observers"".
* The machine translation uses the phrase ""vaheaega ka OSCE vaatlejate rühm"" which is a literal translation of ""was also present after the accident"", but it sounds unnatural in English. A more natural way to translate this phrase would be ""was also present at the accident site"".

Overall, the machine translation makes some errors in grammar and word choice, and the phrasing sounds unnatural in English. The reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""The whole life of human beings should be ranked for the supreme and ultimate purpose of human life."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""The whole life of human beings should be set to the supreme and ultimate purpose of human life."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the verb ""ranked"" instead of ""set"", which is the correct verb in this context.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""inimese kogu elu"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""human beings' whole life"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the word ""inimese"" (meaning ""of or relating to the mind"") instead of ""human beings"", which is the correct term in this context.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""järjestada inimelu ülimale ja viimsele eesmärgile"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""to the supreme and ultimate purpose of human life"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the phrase ""järjestada inimelu ülimale ja viimsele eesmärgile"" which is not a correct or idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic phrase ""to the supreme and ultimate purpose of human life"".

4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""The whole life of human beings should be ranked for the supreme and ultimate purpose of human life."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""The whole life of human beings should be set to the supreme and ultimate purpose of human life."" (correct)

The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation, which is more idiomatic and natural in English.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and uses more appropriate grammar and word choice, making it a better translation of the original Estonian sentence.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""I was surrounded by a person who was also Queen"" - The sentence structure is incorrect, and ""a person who was also Queen"" is not a grammatically correct phrase.
	* Reference translation: ""The Tower was surrounded while the King was there"" - This sentence has a correct sentence structure and the phrase ""while the King was there"" is grammatically correct.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kus viibis ka kuningas"" - The word ""viibis"" is not a correct translation of ""surrounded"" in English. A more accurate translation would be ""surrounded by"".
	* Reference translation: ""the Tower was surrounded"" - This translation uses the correct word ""surrounded"" to convey the meaning of the original Estonian sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kus viibis ka kuningas"" - The phrase ""ka kuningas"" is not an idiomatic expression in English, and it doesn't convey the same meaning as the original Estonian sentence.
	* Reference translation: ""the King was there"" - This translation uses an idiomatic expression that is more natural in English, and it conveys the same meaning as the original Estonian sentence.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""I was surrounded by a person who was also Queen"" - This sentence doesn't take into account the cultural context of the original Estonian sentence, which refers to a historical event in Estonia.
	* Reference translation: ""the Tower was surrounded while the King was there"" - This translation takes into account the cultural context of the original Estonian sentence and conveys the same meaning in a more accurate way.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more accurate grammar, word choice, and idiomatic expressions, and it takes into account the cultural context of the original Estonian sentence.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""umbes kilomeetri sügavusel metaaniplahvatus"" (about a kilometre depths)
	* Reference translation: ""at about one kilometre in the Donetsk Oblast""

The machine translation uses the word ""sügavusel"" (about) instead of ""metaaniplahvatus"" (at about) in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Donetski oblastis Zasjadko söekaevanduses"" (Donetski Oblastis Zmindko coal mine)
	* Reference translation: ""Donetsk Oblast, Zasyadko coal mine""

The machine translation uses the genitive case incorrectly in ""Donetski oblastis Zasjadko"", which should be in the nominative case. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less accurate.

3. Phrasing:
	* Machine translation: ""umbes kilomeetri sügavusel metaaniplahvatus"" (about a kilometre depths)
	* Reference translation: ""at about one kilometre in the Donetsk Oblast""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""umbes kilomeetri sügavusel"" (about a kilometre) instead of ""at about one kilometre"" in the reference translation. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less accurate.

4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Zasjadko söekaevanduses"" (Zindko coal mine)
	* Reference translation: ""Zasyadko coal mine""

The machine translation puts the word ""Zasjadko"" before ""söekaevanduses"" (coal mine), while the reference translation puts it after. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less accurate.

5. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""Zasjadko söekaevanduses"" (Zindko coal mine)
	* Reference translation: ""Zasyadko coal mine""

The machine translation gets the name of the mine wrong, using ""Zasjadko"" instead of ""Zasyadko"". This can make the sentence sound less accurate and less reliable.

Overall, the machine translation has several errors in word choice, grammar, phrasing, word order, and accuracy. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and natural-sounding. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further translation work.

	* Reference translation: ""two Buk missile systems""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""kaks Buk raketisüsteemi"" which is the Estonian phrase for ""two Buk missile systems"". The reference translation uses the more general term ""missile systems"" instead.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""on interventide valduses kaks Buk raketisüsteemi""
	* Reference translation: ""the intervention authorities hold two Buk missile systems""
	* Difference: The machine translation reverses the word order in the sentence, placing ""interventide valduses"" (intervention authorities) before ""kaks Buk raketisüsteemi"" (two Buk missile systems).
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""nõuniku andmetel""
	* Reference translation: ""adviser""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""nõuniku andmetel"" which is not a direct translation of the English term ""adviser"".

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""war in Libya"" (MT) vs. ""war in Livonia"" (Ref)
		+ The machine translation uses the word ""Libya"" instead of ""Livonia"". This is likely due to a mistake in the training data or a misunderstanding of the context.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""he was quite successful in the war in Libya"" (MT) vs. ""he was quite successful in the war in Livonia"" (Ref)
		+ The machine translation uses the present tense ""was"" instead of the past tense ""was"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall fluency of the translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""oma kantsleri"" (MT) vs. ""his Chancellor"" (Ref)
		+ The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""oma kantsleri"" instead of the English phrase ""his Chancellor"". This is a common mistake in machine translation, as the system may not have enough data to recognize idiomatic expressions.
4. Noun agreement:
	* Machine translation: ""Jan Zamoyskiga"" (MT) vs. ""Jan Zamoyski"" (Ref)
		+ The machine translation uses the singular form ""Jan Zamoyskiga"" instead of the plural form ""Jan Zamoyski"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall accuracy of the translation.
5. Sentence structure:

		+ The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with multiple clauses, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a single clause.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, noun agreement, and sentence structure. However, it's important to note that machine translation is a challenging task, and even high-quality machine translation systems can make mistakes.

1. Word choice: In the machine translation, the word ""küsima"" (ask) is translated as ""consider."" However, in the reference translation, the word ""küsima"" is translated as ""consider that."" This difference in word choice may affect the nuance of the sentence, as ""küsima"" has a more tentative connotation than ""consider.""
2. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""as such,"" which is a common idiomatic expression in English, but it may not be the most idiomatic way to translate the Estonian phrase ""tundeid kui niisuguseid."" In the reference translation, the phrase is translated as ""prejudices,"" which is a more literal and idiomatic way to convey the meaning of the Estonian phrase.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense. This difference in verb tense may affect the time frame of the action being described, with the machine translation implying that the person is currently asking whether he can consider people's unpleasant feelings, while the reference translation implies that the person has already considered that people's unpleasant feelings are prejudices.
4. Word order: The machine translation places the verb ""ask"" at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation places it at the beginning.

3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""is being carried"" while the reference translation uses the present simple ""is worn."" The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as the fabric is not being carried, but rather worn.
4. Idioms: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""on the skirts"" in English. In Estonian, the phrase ""kangatükk"" is used to describe something that is worn on the skirt, and this is not easily conveyed in English.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Esthonia"" (2 times)
	* Reference translation: ""Estonia"" (3 times)

The machine translation uses the spelling ""Esthonia"" twice, while the reference translation uses the spelling ""Estonia"" three times. This is a minor difference, but it's important to be consistent in the spelling of the country's name throughout the translation.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""this name was mostly written in English by Esthonia""
	* Reference translation: ""this name was mostly written in English as Estonia""

The machine translation uses a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. The machine translation places the prepositional phrase ""in English"" after the verb ""was,"" while the reference translation places it before the noun ""name."" This is a more common and idiomatic way of expressing the idea in English.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""lõpuni"" (Estonian) -> ""end of"" (English)
	* Reference translation: ""inglise keeles"" (Estonian) -> ""in English"" (English)

The machine translation uses literal translations of some Estonian phrases, which can sound unnatural in English. For example, the machine translation uses the Estonian word ""lõpuni"" (which means ""end of"") and translates it literally as ""end of"" in English. Similarly, the machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""inglise keeles"" (which means ""in English"") and translates it literally as ""in English"" in English. In contrast, the reference translation uses more idiomatic and natural-sounding expressions in English.

4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""aastate lõpuni kirjutati seda nime inglise keeles""
	* Reference translation: ""Until the end of the 1930s, this name was mostly written in English as Estonia""

The machine translation and the reference translation have different word orders. The machine translation places the adverb ""aastate"" (meaning ""until"") before the verb ""kirjutati"" (meaning ""was written""), while the reference translation places it after the verb. Additionally, the reference translation uses a more natural word order in English, with the adverb ""Until"" appearing at the beginning of the sentence.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Both Presidents promised to work together to convince Iran to abandon the nuclear programme."" (incorrect use of ""to"" instead of ""to convince"")
	* Reference translation: ""Both Presidents promised to work together to convince Iran to abandon the nuclear program."" (correct use of ""programme"" instead of ""program"")

	* Reference translation: ""Both Presidents""
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""lubasid"" (incorrect use of ""lubasid"" instead of ""promised"")
	* Reference translation: ""promised""
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""Iraani"" (incorrect use of ""Iran"" instead of ""Iranian"")
	* Reference translation: ""Iranian""
5. Fluency:

Machine Translation: ""Artistic views on nature were no less scientific than the current one.""

* The sentence structure is slightly different, with the machine translation using a more complex sentence structure.
* The word choice ""artistic"" is not used in the reference translation, which uses the more neutral term ""former"".
* The phrase ""no less"" is translated differently, with the machine translation using ""less"" instead of ""no less"".
* The word ""current"" is translated differently, with the machine translation using the more formal term ""current one"" instead of the more informal ""current"".

Reference Translation: ""The former views on nature were no less scientific than the current ones.""

* The sentence structure is the same in both translations.
* The word choice ""former"" is used in the reference translation, which is a more accurate translation of the Estonian word ""kunagised"".
* The phrase ""no less"" is translated correctly in both translations.
* The word ""ones"" is used in the reference translation, which is a more accurate translation of the Estonian word ""teaduslikud"".

Overall, the machine translation makes some minor errors in word choice and sentence structure, while the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding. However, both translations convey the same meaning, which is that the views on nature in the past were just as scientific as they are now.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source: ""Selle tõrjumiseks tundusid Saksa väejuhatusel puuduvat igasugused vahendid.""
Machine Translation: ""In order to counter this, the German army's leadership did not have any means at all.""
Reference Translation: ""The German army 's leadership did not seem to have any means at all to counter this.""

Difference 1: Word order

The machine translation changes the word order of the source sentence, moving ""Selle tõrjumiseks"" to the beginning of the sentence. In the reference translation, the word order is preserved, which is more accurate.

2. Source: ""Selle tõrjumiseks tundusid""
Machine Translation: ""In order to counter this""
Reference Translation: ""The German army 's leadership did not seem to have any means at all""

Difference 2: Omissions

The machine translation omits the word ""tundusid"" from the source sentence, which means ""to counter"". This is a significant difference, as it changes the meaning of the sentence entirely.

3. Source: ""Saksa väejuhatusel""
Machine Translation: ""the German army's leadership""
Reference Translation: ""the German army""

Difference 3: Noun agreement

The machine translation uses the singular form ""leadership"" to translate ""Saksa väejuhatusel"", which is incorrect. The correct translation is ""the German army"".

4. Source: ""puuduvat igasugused vahendid""
Machine Translation: ""did not have any means at all""
Reference Translation: ""did not seem to have any means at all""

Difference 4: Tense

The machine translation uses the present tense ""puuduvat"" to translate ""puuduvat igasugused vahendid"", which is incorrect. The correct translation is ""did not seem to have"".

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not accurate and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The reference translation is more precise and faithful to the original Estonian sentence.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""olulised füüsika"" (important for physics)
	* Reference translation: ""important for physics""
	
The machine translation uses the word ""olulised"" which is not a common word in English. The reference translation uses the more common phrase ""important for physics"".

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Kõverate omadused olid matemaatikuid alati huvitanud"" (Mathematics were always interested in the properties of the curve)
	* Reference translation: ""Mathematicians had always been interested in the properties of curves""
	
The machine translation uses the verb ""olid"" which is not necessary in English. The reference translation uses the correct verb ""had been interested"".

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""but now it turned out that they are important for physics""
	* Reference translation: ""but now it turned out that mathematics are important for physics""
	
The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, which can make it sound less natural in English. The reference translation keeps the original word order of the sentence.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""olulised füüsika jaoks"" (for physics)
	* Reference translation: ""for physics""
	
The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""jaoks"" which is not a common idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more common phrase ""for physics"".

5. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""Kõverate omadused olid matemaatikuid alati huvitanud, aga nüüd selgus, et need on olulised füüsika jaoks."" (Mathematics were always interested in the properties of the curve, but now it turned out that they are important for physics.)
	* Reference translation: ""Mathematicians had always been interested in the properties of curves, but now it turned out that they are important for physics.""
	
The machine translation is generally accurate, but there are some minor errors in word choice and grammar. The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. However, the machine translation is still usable for basic communication, especially for those who are not native English speakers.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""covering more than 10 000 years"" while the reference translation uses the phrase ""covering more than 10,000 years."" The difference is in the use of a comma after the number 10,000, which is a more common way of writing this phrase in English.
2. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include any punctuation after the phrase ""This is the longest period in Estonia's history,"" while the reference translation includes a period at the end of the sentence.
3. Capitalization: The machine translation does not capitalize the word ""Eesti"" in the phrase ""Eesti ajaloo pikima perioodiga,"" while the reference translation does capitalize it.
4. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, putting ""perioodiga"" after ""ajaloo"" instead of before it. This is a common mistake in machine translation, as the algorithm may not always understand the correct word order in a sentence.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense for the verb ""covering."" This is a more accurate translation, as the sentence is describing a historical event that took place in the past.
6. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""history.""

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, punctuation, capitalization, word order, grammar, and idiomatic expressions. However, it's important to note that machine translation algorithms are constantly improving, and this may be a more accurate translation in the future.

3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""elab"" (are) in the first sentence, while the reference translation uses the verb ""on"" (are) in the second sentence. This is a minor difference in grammar, but it can affect the overall flow and readability of the translation.
4. Terminology: The machine translation uses the term ""pärismaiseid"" (indigenous) instead of ""indigenous"" in the reference translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""crews"" instead of ""host species"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. ""Crews"" implies a group of people working together, while ""host species"" is a more scientific term used in biology to refer to the organism that a parasite or pathogen infects.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""have infected"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""have infected""). This difference is due to the fact that the reference translation is based on a previous study, and the information may be outdated. However, the machine translation may be more up-to-date, as it is generated in real-time based on the latest data available.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence slightly, placing ""for a relatively short time"" after ""viruses"" instead of before it. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the emphasis of the sentence. In the reference translation, the word order is more traditional, with the adverb ""relatively"" modifying the verb ""infected"".
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""for a relatively short time"" instead of the more common idiomatic expression ""for a short period of time"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the naturalness of the translation.

	* Machine translation: ""Tkiss Lehtsaak"" (using the Estonian name ""Tkiss"" instead of ""Tõnu"")
	* Reference translation: ""Tõnu Lehtsaar"" (using the correct Estonian name)
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""standing for election to the State"" (incorrect - the correct phrase in Estonian is ""vaadekäitumisele Riigikogu valimisele"")
	* Reference translation: ""standing for election to the Riigikogu"" (correct)
3. Punctuation:
	* Machine translation: ""Isamaa ja Res Publica Liidu nimekirjas"" (incorrect - the correct phrase in Estonian is ""Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit"")
	* Reference translation: ""Pro Patria and Res Publica Union"" (correct)
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""the religious psychologist, Tkiss Lehtsaak"" (incorrect - the correct phrase in Estonian is ""Tõnu Lehtsaar, religioonipsühholoog"")
	* Reference translation: ""Tõnu Lehtsaar, religious psychologist"" (correct)
5. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""teatas"" (incorrect - the correct word in Estonian is ""teadus"")
	* Reference translation: ""announced"" (correct)

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in word choice, grammar, punctuation, and word order, which can affect the overall meaning and clarity of the sentence. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more reliable and accurate source for Estonian-English translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""event"" (MT) vs. ""innate"" (Ref)
		+ Reason: The machine translation uses the word ""event"" to convey the meaning of the Estonian word ""öelda"", which can also be translated as ""innate"". However, ""event"" has a broader meaning in English, encompassing any significant occurrence or happening, whereas ""innate"" specifically refers to something that is inherent or innermost.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is slightly different in the machine translation, with the verb ""wanted"" placed in the subjunctive mood instead of the indicative mood in the reference translation.
		+ Reason: The machine translation may have struggled to accurately convey the subjunctive mood of the Estonian sentence, which is more complex than the indicative mood in English.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""kaasasündinud"" in the Estonian sentence, which means ""must be innate"".
		+ Reason: This idiomatic expression is specific to Estonian and may not be easily recognizable or translateable by machine translation algorithms.
4. Contextual understanding:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not fully understand the context of the sentence, as it does not capture the nuances of the Estonian language.
		+ Reason: The machine translation may not have been trained on enough Estonian data to accurately understand the context and nuances of the language, leading to inaccuracies in the translation.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the Estonian sentence. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Estonian language and idiomatic expressions more accurately, while also using more appropriate grammar and word choice. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""sending a frontline over partisan groups"" while the reference translation uses ""sending partisan groups over the front line."" The reference translation uses a more idiomatic phrase to convey the intended meaning.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""it's"") in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""his particular tasks included""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and naturalness of the translation.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the prepositional phrase ""over partisan groups"" after the verb ""sent,"" while the reference translation places it before the verb. This is a matter of style and personal preference, but the reference translation's word order is more common in English.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""over the front line"" to convey the idea of advancing beyond the front line of a military conflict. The machine translation does not use this idiomatic expression, which may make the translation sound less natural to an English speaker.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation accurately conveys the meaning of the Estonian sentence, but the reference translation is more precise in its wording. For example, the machine translation uses the phrase ""partisan groups"" instead of ""partisan units,"" which is a more accurate translation of the Estonian word ""partisanigruppide.""

Based on these differences, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation. The reference translation is more natural, idiomatic, and accurate in its wording, which makes it a better representation of the original Estonian text.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""exploded"" in both the source and reference translations, but the reference translation uses the phrase ""roadside bomb exploded"" to provide more context and clarity.
2. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a more simple phrase structure in the source translation, while the reference translation uses a more complex phrase structure with ""in the east of"" to provide more context.
3. Preposition usage: The machine translation uses the preposition ""in"" in the source translation, while the reference translation uses ""in the east of"" to provide more context and clarity.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order in the source translation, placing "" Baghdad"" after ""the east of"" instead of before it.
5. Article usage: The machine translation omits the definite article ""the"" in the source translation, while the reference translation includes it.
6. Tense consistency: The machine translation changes the tense in the source translation, using the past tense ""exploded"" instead of the present tense ""explodes"".
7. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""roadside bomb"" in the source translation, while the reference translation includes it to provide more context and clarity.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation. The reference translation provides more context and clarity, and uses more appropriate language to convey the intended meaning. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses simpler language and omits important details, resulting in a less accurate and less fluent translation.

  As a helpful assistant, I will evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation provided in the given source. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""the cult of virtues is a machine of drowning or self-deception to himself""
	* Reference translation: ""the cultivation of virtues in oneself has a tinge of arrogance or self-deception to it""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""machine of drowning"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the phrase ""tinge of arrogance"" which is a more natural and idiomatic way to convey the idea of self-deception.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""voruste kultiveerimisel"" (cultivation of virtues)
	* Reference translation: ""education""

The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""voruste"" which means ""bereaved"" in English. However, the reference translation uses the more common English term ""education"".

3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""on voruste kultiveerimisel"" (at the bereaved level)
	* Reference translation: ""in oneself""

The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""on voruste"" which means ""at the bereaved level"" in English. However, the reference translation uses the more common English phrase ""in oneself"".

4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Kuigi kasvatus sisaldab vooruste kultiveerimist kasvatatavate juures, on voruste kultiveerimisel iseenda juures upsakuse või enesepettuse maik man.""
	* Reference translation: ""Although education involves cultivating virtues in those who are educated, the cultivation of virtues in oneself has a tinge of arrogance or self-deception to it.""

The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure with multiple clauses, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with fewer clauses.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more natural and idiomatic expressions, and the sentence structure is simpler and easier to follow. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses some uncommon phrases and sentence structures that can make it difficult to understand the intended meaning.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""the country's new Prime Minister"" is placed at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed at the beginning.
2. Use of articles: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""Prime Minister,"" while the reference translation does not.
3. Plural nouns: The machine translation uses the plural form of the noun ""elections"" (""elections won""), while the reference translation uses the singular form (""election won"").
4. Tense: The machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation is in the past tense.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""erakonna"" (meaning ""country's"") instead of the more common ""maa"" (meaning ""country"").
6. Phrase structure: The machine translation breaks the sentence into two separate phrases, while the reference translation keeps the sentence intact.
7. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""the same"" to describe the Prime Minister, while the reference translation does.
8. Grammar: The machine translation has a grammatical error in the phrase ""electedd Samak Sundaravej,"" where the verb ""elected"" is in the wrong form.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more natural and idiomatic expression of the original Estonian sentence, while the machine translation has errors in word order, tense, and grammar.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given source text:

1. Word order: The machine translation keeps the original word order in Estonian, while the reference translation rearranges the words to better convey the meaning in English. For example, in the machine translation, ""Saaremaal algas Kaitseliidu"" is translated as ""On the island of the island,"" while in the reference translation, it's translated as ""The three-day trainig exercise of the Defence League.""
2. Phrase structure: The machine translation tends to break up longer phrases into smaller ones, while the reference translation keeps the phrases intact. For example, in the machine translation, ""Kaitseliidu kolmepäevane suurõppus"" is translated as ""the Union for Defence launched a three-day 'Orkaan 2014' training exercise,"" while in the reference translation, it's translated as ""the three-day trainig exercise of the Defence League, Orkaan 2014.""
3. Word choice: The machine translation sometimes uses more formal or technical words that may not be immediately understandable to English speakers, while the reference translation uses more idiomatic expressions. For example, in the machine translation, ""Orkaan 2014"" is translated as ""training exercise,"" while in the reference translation, it's translated as ""the three-day trainig exercise of the Defence League, Orkaan 2014.""
4. Grammar: The machine translation sometimes makes grammatical errors, such as using the wrong verb tense or subject-verb agreement. For example, in the machine translation, ""On the island of the island, the Union for Defence launched a three-day 'Orkaan 2014' training exercise"" uses the present tense ""launched"" instead of the past tense ""launched"" to describe an event that occurred in the past.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation may not capture cultural references or idioms that are specific to Estonian or English language usage. For example, the reference translation uses the phrase ""trainig exercise"" to refer to a training exercise, which is a more common term in English than ""training exercise.""

Overall, while the machine translation provides a rough translation of the source text, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic in English. The reference translation takes into account the nuances of both Estonian and English languages and cultures, resulting in a more natural and fluent translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""chickens"" instead of ""flowers"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is"") to describe the enjoyment of chickens and animals, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was"") to describe the enjoyment of flowers. This difference in tense can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the enjoyment of chickens and animals is ongoing, while the enjoyment of flowers is no longer happening.
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""the people who do so"" comes after the verb ""enjoy,"" while in the reference translation, it comes before the verb. This difference in word order can affect the emphasis of the sentence, with the machine translation placing more emphasis on the people who are enjoying the chickens and animals, while the reference translation places more emphasis on the enjoyment itself.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""something to do with virtues"" instead of the more common idiomatic expression ""has something to do with virtues"" used in the reference translation. This difference in idiomatic expression can affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the accusative case for the word ""chickens"" (""chickens""), while the reference translation uses the nominative case (""flowers""). This difference in grammar can affect the overall structure of the sentence and the way it is perceived by the reader.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word choice, tense, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given source:

Machine Translation:

* ""Podolski vapp on registreeritud Venemaa Föderatsiooni riiklikus heraldikaregistris numbri 1801 all.""

Reference Translation:

* ""The Podolsk coat of arms is registered in the national heraldry register of the Russian Federation under number 1801.""

Differences:

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the words ""Venemaa Föderatsiooni"" are placed after the verb ""registreeritud"", while in the reference translation, they are placed before the verb.
2. Use of prepositions: In the machine translation, the preposition ""Venemaa"" is used before the noun ""Föderatsiooni"", while in the reference translation, the preposition ""of"" is used.
3. Use of articles: In the machine translation, the article ""a"" is used before the noun ""Podolski"", while in the reference translation, the article ""the"" is used.
4. Spelling: In the machine translation, the name ""Podolski"" is spelled with an ""i"" instead of an ""e"".
5. Number agreement: In the machine translation, the number ""1801"" is not matched with the noun ""numbri"", which is in the singular form. In the reference translation, the number is matched with the noun ""number"", which is in the singular form.

Overall, the machine translation contains several errors in word order, preposition usage, spelling, and number agreement, which can affect the accuracy and readability of the translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and idiomatic, with proper word order, preposition usage, and number agreement.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, moving ""siis"" (if) to the end of the sentence. In the reference translation, ""siis"" is placed earlier in the sentence, after ""Kui"".
2. Use of ""tal"": The machine translation uses ""tal"" (if) instead of ""siis"" (if) in the first part of the sentence. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations may not always capture the nuances of Estonian grammar and syntax.
3. Use of ""oleks"": The machine translation changes the verb form of ""oleks"" (there is/are) to ""oleks tal"" (there is/are if). This is another common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations may not always capture the correct verb forms in Estonian.
4. Use of ""suhe"": The machine translation changes the word ""suhe"" (practice) to ""practice"" in the second part of the sentence. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
5. Use of ""üldse"": The machine translation changes the word ""üldse"" (at all) to ""at all"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word order, verb forms, and the use of certain words. While the machine translation may be adequate for basic communication, it may not capture the nuances and complexities of the original Estonian sentence. Therefore, I would recommend using a human translator for more accurate and idiomatic translations.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""declassification"" (MT) vs. ""falsification"" (RT)
		+ Declassification is a more formal term that implies a change in classification status, while falsification implies a deliberate distortion or manipulation of information.
		+ In this context, the reference translation is more accurate as it conveys a more nuanced meaning.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""will lead to"" (MT) vs. ""results in"" (RT)
		+ The machine translation uses the future tense ""will lead to,"" while the reference translation uses the present tense ""results in.""
		+ This is a minor difference, but the reference translation is more idiomatic in English.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""some kind of"" (MT) vs. ""certain part of"" (RT)
		+ The machine translation uses a more general phrase, while the reference translation uses a more specific phrase.
		+ The reference translation is more accurate as it conveys a clearer image of the specific aspect of background knowledge that is being referred to.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""assumption will lead to"" (MT) vs. ""assumption results in"" (RT)
		+ The machine translation reverses the word order of the original sentence, while the reference translation maintains the original word order.
		+ This is a minor difference, but the reference translation is more idiomatic in English.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. While the machine translation is understandable, it lacks the nuance and precision of the reference translation. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""others are not taken into account"" instead of the reference translation's ""if fjords and other bays are not taken into account."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference translation uses more specific language to convey the idea that fjords and other bays are not included in the calculation of the coastline.
2. Word order: The machine translation puts the phrase ""on rannajoone pikkus"" at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation places it earlier in the sentence. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the flow of the sentence.
3. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a more complex phrase structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a subordinate clause (""If fjords and others are not taken into account"") while the reference translation uses a simpler phrase structure (""if fjords and other bays are not taken into account"").
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are not taken into account"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""were not taken into account""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the tone and style of the translation.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""bays"" to refer to smaller bodies of water.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation uses more specific language and a simpler phrase structure to convey the idea that fjords and other bays are not included in the calculation of the coastline. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses a more complex phrase structure and word choice that can make the sentence sound less natural and less accurate.

2. Machine Translation: ""This is certainly not what is usually understood by the principle of equality.""
3. Reference Translation: ""This is certainly not what is usually understood as the principle of equality.""

Comparison:

* The machine translation and reference translation both accurately convey the meaning of the source text, which is that the principle of equality is not being applied in the given situation.
* However, the machine translation uses more complex language than the reference translation, which may make it less clear or understandable for some readers. For example, the machine translation uses the phrase ""what is usually understood by the principle of equality,"" while the reference translation uses a simpler phrase, ""the principle of equality.""
* Additionally, the machine translation uses the word ""printsiibi,"" which is not a commonly used word in English and may be difficult for some readers to understand. In contrast, the reference translation uses the more common phrase ""as the principle of equality.""

Overall, while both translations accurately convey the meaning of the source text, the reference translation is more clear and concise, making it a better choice for readers who may not be familiar with the nuances of Estonian language and culture.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""At home, however, the grandmother, Alma, awaits Jaanus again""
	* Reference translation: ""At home, Jaanus is again greeted by his grandmother, Alma""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""at home, however,"" which is not found in the reference translation. The reference translation uses the phrase ""at home"" twice, which is more concise and natural-sounding.

2. Tense consistency:
	* Machine translation: ""and when Jane arrives home, the strain will be brought up""
	* Reference translation: ""and when Jane arrives at home as well , they begin to quarrel""

The machine translation switches to the future tense (""will be brought up"") for the second part of the sentence, while the reference translation uses the present tense (""begin to quarrel"") to maintain consistency.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Jaanus again, and when Jane arrives home, the strain will be brought up""
	* Reference translation: ""Jaanus is again greeted by his grandmother, Alma, and when Jane arrives at home as well, they begin to quarrel""

The machine translation reverses the order of the phrases, placing ""Jaanus again"" before ""and when Jane arrives home."" This can make the sentence sound less natural and more awkward.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""võetakse tüli üles"" (literally ""to bring up the strain"")
	* Reference translation: ""they begin to quarrel""

The machine translation uses a literal translation of the Estonian phrase ""võetakse tüli üles,"" which doesn't quite convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The reference translation uses the more idiomatic expression ""begin to quarrel,"" which is more natural and common in English.

Overall, the machine translation has some errors and inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The reference translation is more natural-sounding and better conveys the intended meaning of the original Estonian sentence.

1. Word order: The machine translation keeps the original word order of the Estonian sentence, while the reference translation rearranges the words to better convey the meaning in English. For example, in the machine translation, ""Ma tegin täpselt samuti nagu Markii de Sade"" becomes ""I did just like Markii de Sade"" in the reference translation.
2. Phrase structure: The machine translation breaks up the long phrase ""täpselt samuti nagu Markii de Sade"" into two shorter phrases, while the reference translation keeps the phrase intact. This results in a different sentence structure in the two translations.
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""tégelastele"" (figures) instead of ""kõikidele"" (all characters) in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense to indicate that the action of giving ages occurred in the past.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""kes annab"" (who gives) in the reference translation. This is a common idiomatic expression in Estonian that is often translated as ""who gives"" or ""who provides"".

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the meaning of the original Estonian sentence more closely and uses more appropriate English phrasing. The machine translation, on the other hand, makes some significant changes to the word order and phrase structure, which can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

3. Name of the port: The machine translation uses the name ""Nacala sadamasse"" instead of ""Nacala on the coast of Mozambique"" in the reference translation.
4. Accuracy of translation: The machine translation seems to have some accuracy issues, especially with the name of the port. The reference translation uses the correct name of the port, ""Nacala"", which is located on the coast of Mozambique.
5. Fluency: The machine translation seems to be less fluent than the reference translation. The reference translation flows better and is more natural-sounding.
6. Cultural context: The machine translation seems to lack some cultural context, as it uses the phrase ""East"" without any additional context. In the reference translation, the direction ""East"" is accompanied by the name of the country, ""Mozambique"", which provides more context.
7. Grammar: The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the singular form of the verb ""leading"" instead of the plural form ""lead"".

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate, fluent, and culturally contextualized than the machine translation. The machine translation seems to struggle with the word order, prepositions, and accuracy of names and locations.

	* Machine translation: ""In Estonia, Mr Hotels, as CEO of the Hotel, was recruited by former Minister of Finance, Mr Ahanr War."" (incorrect use of ""Hotel"" instead of ""Tallink Hotels"")
	* Reference translation: ""In Estonia, Aivar Sõerd, former Minister of Finance, took office as the CEO of the Tallink Hotels chain."" (correct use of ""Tallink Hotels"")
2. Word choice and terminology:
	* Machine translation: ""Mr Hotels"" (incorrect use of ""Hotels"" instead of ""Tallink Hotels"")
	* Reference translation: ""Aivar Sõerd"" (correct use of the name ""Aivar Sõerd"")
3. Punctuation:
	* Machine translation: ""In Estonia, Mr Hotels, as CEO of the Hotel, was recruited by former Minister of Finance, Mr Ahanr War."" (incorrect use of punctuation)
	* Reference translation: ""In Estonia, Aivar Sõerd, former Minister of Finance, took office as the CEO of the Tallink Hotels chain."" (correct use of punctuation)
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Mr Hotels"" (incorrect use of an English idiomatic expression in Estonian)
	* Reference translation: ""Aivar Sõerd"" (correct use of the Estonian name and idiomatic expression)
5. Names and titles:
	* Machine translation: ""Mr Ahanr War"" (incorrect use of the name and title)
	* Reference translation: ""Aivar Sõerd, former Minister of Finance"" (correct use of the name and title)

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, word choice, punctuation, and idiomatic expressions, which can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and idiomatic, reflecting a better understanding of both Estonian and English.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Need pingutused jäävad ühe"" (nominal phrase)
	* Reference translation: ""These efforts remain within the framework of the same research programme"" (verb-based sentence)

The machine translation uses a nominal phrase structure, which is different from the reference translation's verb-based sentence structure. In the reference translation, the verb ""remain"" is used to convey the idea of continuity and stability, which is more appropriate for the context.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""jäävad"" (past tense of ""jääma"")
	* Reference translation: ""remain""

The machine translation uses the past tense of the verb ""jääma"" (meaning ""to remain""), which is not the most appropriate choice in this context. The reference translation uses the verb ""remain"" instead, which is more commonly used in English to convey the idea of continuing to be in a particular state or position.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""ühe"" (meaning ""the same"")
	* Reference translation: ""the same""

The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""ühe"" to translate the English phrase ""the same"". However, this word may not be the most idiomatic choice in English, as it can also mean ""each"" or ""every"". The reference translation uses the more common English phrase ""the same"" to convey the idea of uniformity and consistency.

4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone is more formal and technical, while the reference translation is more conversational and informal.

The machine translation uses a more formal and technical tone, which may not be suitable for all contexts. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses a more conversational and informal tone, which is more appropriate for everyday communication.

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation. While the machine translation is grammatically correct, it lacks the nuance and idiomatic expressions that are necessary for effective communication in English. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more idiomatic and conveys the intended meaning more accurately.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""enamik"" (existing) is translated as ""most of the existing"" in the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: ""sajandil"" (11th century) is translated as ""in the 11th century"" in the reference translation.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is different in the two translations. The machine translation uses a compound sentence with two clauses, while the reference translation uses a simple sentence with a subordinate clause.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the past tense consistently throughout the sentence, while the machine translation uses both the past and present tenses.
3. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the word ""maha"" (big) to translate ""suuremad"", which is a more formal or literary term in Estonian. In everyday speech, people might use the word ""suure"" (big) instead.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the word ""strongholds"" to translate ""linnustest"", which is a more formal term in English. In everyday speech, people might use the word ""cities"" or ""towns"".
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""tugevamini kindlustatud"" (which means ""which were much bigger and more secure""). This expression is specific to Estonian and doesn't have a direct translation in English.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Estonian language better, such as the use of the formal term ""linnustest"" and the idiomatic expression ""tugevamini kindlustatud"". The machine translation, on the other hand, uses more formal language and doesn't capture the subtleties of the Estonian language.

	* Reference translation: ""Lyublyana"" (Russian) -> ""Lyublyana"" (English)
4. Spelling:
	* Machine translation: ""kuue"" (Estonian) -> ""total"" (English)
	* Reference translation: ""kuu"" (Estonian) -> ""more than"" (English)
5. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""kokku dirigeeris"" (Estonian) -> ""she revised"" (English)
	* Reference translation: ""he conducted"" (English) -> ""kokku dirigeeris"" (Estonian)

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation has made some significant errors in word choice, grammar, and phrasing. For example, the machine translation uses the word ""kuue"" (Estonian) instead of ""kuu"" (Estonian) in the first sentence, which results in a grammatically incorrect sentence in English. Similarly, the machine translation uses the word ""operators"" instead of ""operas"" in the second sentence, which is a significant error in word choice.

Overall, the machine translation is not a reliable source for Estonian-English translation, and it is recommended to use a reference translation for accuracy and clarity.

4. Preposition usage: The machine translation uses the preposition ""near"" instead of ""into"" in the reference translation.
5. Name translation: The machine translation translates the Estonian name ""Glåma"" to ""Glåma"" in English, while the reference translation translates it to ""Glomma"".
6. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""fjord"" instead of ""fjordi"" in the reference translation.
7. Grammar: The machine translation has a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence is in the simple present tense, while in the reference translation, it is in the present perfect tense.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has made several errors in word order, article usage, number agreement, preposition usage, and word choice.

2. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is simpler and more straightforward in the machine translation, with a clear subject-verb-object pattern. In contrast, the reference translation has a more complex sentence structure with multiple clauses.
	* Machine translation: The verb tenses are consistent throughout the sentence, with all verbs in the present tense. In contrast, the reference translation uses both present and past tenses.
3. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses more general vocabulary, such as ""dried fish"" instead of ""kala"" (fish).
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses ""kidnappers"" instead of ""röövikuid"" (caterpillars), which is a more accurate translation of the Estonian word.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation includes ""cameras,"" which is a cultural reference that may not be familiar to all readers. In contrast, the reference translation uses ""dried fish,"" which is a more culturally relevant term in Estonia.
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not include any idiomatic expressions, such as ""sibulat"" (a type of cabbage) or ""aga ka kuivatatud"" (a type of dried fish).
6. Grammar and syntax errors:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation contains several grammar and syntax errors, such as the incorrect use of the article ""a"" before ""cameras"" and the lack of a verb after ""ka.""

Overall, the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar and syntax, vocabulary, cultural references, and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation is more accurate and culturally relevant, and it better conveys the intended meaning of the Estonian sentence.

The machine translation uses the term ""multidimensional paradigm,"" which is not a common term in English. The reference translation uses the term ""corpuscular paradigm,"" which is more accurate and commonly used in English.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""brought a new problem and, to a large extent, a solution""

The machine translation uses the incorrect form of the verb ""brought"" in the second clause, which should be ""brought"" instead of ""brought."" Additionally, the machine translation omits the article ""its"" before ""solution,"" which is necessary for proper grammar.

3. Idiomatic expressions:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""it is only possible"" while the reference translation uses ""He can only know."" This suggests that the machine translation may not have captured the nuance of the original sentence as well as the reference translation.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""can only know""). This may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately convey the time frame in which the value of human beings can be known.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the verb ""to know"" after the noun ""value,"" while the reference translation places it before. This may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, with the machine translation suggesting that the value is something that can be known through experience, while the reference translation emphasizes the idea that the value is something that is experienced.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""directly experience"" while the reference translation uses ""experience the value directly."" The reference translation may be more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the passive voice in the sentence (""It is only possible..."") while the reference translation uses the active voice (""He can only know...""). This may affect the clarity and readability of the sentence.

1. Source Text:

The source text is in Estonian: ""Kuhni raamatus räägitakse aga ka subjektiivsest teadmisest, nimelt siis, kui jutt on geštaldivahetusest.""

2. Machine Translation:

The machine translation of the source text is: ""However, the Kuhn Paper also talks about subjective knowledge, namely when it comes to the exchange of views.""

3. Reference Translation:

The reference translation of the source text is: ""However , Kuhn 's book also talks about subjective knowledge , namely when it comes to the change of gestalt .""

Comparison:

The machine translation and reference translation differ in several areas:

* Word choice: The machine translation uses ""exchange of views"" instead of ""change of gestalt"" in the reference translation.
* Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""talks"") instead of the past tense (""talked"") in the reference translation.
* Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""change of gestalt"" which is not found in the machine translation.

Quality Evaluation:

Based on the differences above, the quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation. The machine translation has introduced some errors in word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions, which can affect the overall accuracy and fluency of the translation.

Recommendations:

To improve the quality of the machine translation, the following changes could be made:

* Use the past tense (""talked"") instead of the present tense (""talks"") to match the reference translation.
* Replace ""exchange of views"" with ""change of gestalt"" to match the idiomatic expression used in the reference translation.

By making these changes, the machine translation can be improved to better match the quality of the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""The security man stayed at the door used teargas balloons against the aggressors and gave way to space.""
	* Reference translation: ""A security guard standing in front of the building door used a tear gas canister against the attackers and retreated to the room.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the present tense ""stayed"" instead of the past tense ""stood"" in the reference translation. Additionally, the machine translation uses the word ""aggressors"" instead of ""attackers"" in the reference translation.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""turvamees"" (security man)
	* Reference translation: ""seisnud"" (security guard)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""turvamees"" which is the Estonian word for ""security man"", while the reference translation uses the word ""seisnud"" which is the Estonian word for ""security guard"".
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""ründajate vastu"" (used teargas balloons)
	* Reference translation: ""taandus ruumi"" (retreated to the room)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""used teargas balloons"" which is not a common expression in English, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""retreated to the room"" which is a more common and idiomatic expression in English.
4. Fluency and coherence:
	* Machine translation: The translation seems to be choppy and lacks fluency, with awkward phrasing and sentence structure.
	* Reference translation: The translation is more fluent and coherent, with better sentence structure and phrasing.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, vocabulary, and idioms, and the phrasing and sentence structure are awkward and lack fluency. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and natural-sounding, with better grammar, vocabulary, and idioms, and a more coherent and fluent sentence structure.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Juuliks oli pool Eestit Saksa vägede kontrolli all."" (The sentence is in the present tense, but the verb ""oli"" should be in the past tense to match the time frame of the sentence.)
	* Reference translation: ""By July, half of Estonia was under the control of German troops."" (The sentence is in the past tense, which is appropriate for a historical event.)
2. Word choice and vocabulary:

	* Reference translation: ""half of Estonia"" (The reference translation uses the phrase ""half of Estonia"" instead of ""Eestit"", which is the correct word in this context.)
3. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Juuliks oli pool Eestit Saksa vägede kontrolli all."" (The sentence is structured as a simple sentence, while the reference translation uses a compound sentence with two independent clauses.)
	* Reference translation: ""By July, half of Estonia was under the control of German troops, and the other half was still free."" (The reference translation uses a compound sentence to convey the same information as the machine translation, but with more detail and clarity.)
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Saksa vägede"" (The machine translation uses the phrase ""Saksa vägede"", which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Estonian. The correct phrase would be ""Saksama"")
	* Reference translation: ""under the control of German troops"" (The reference translation uses a more idiomatic expression in English, which is more accurate and natural-sounding.)

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Grammar and syntax:
The machine translation and reference translation have the same grammatical structure and syntax. Both sentences are in the present tense and use the same verb forms.
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
The machine translation uses more formal and technical vocabulary than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the term ""natural scientific method"" instead of ""scientific method"" in the reference translation. This may be due to the machine translation's attempt to use more formal and technical language to convey the meaning.
3. Idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms:
The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms in the source text. For example, the Estonian phrase ""põhimõtteliselt ei alluks loodusteaduslikule"" is not translated directly into English and may be difficult for a non-native speaker to understand.
4. Cultural references and nuances:
The machine translation may not capture the cultural references and nuances in the source text. For example, the phrase ""loodusteaduslikule"" in the source text may have a specific meaning in Estonian culture that is not easily translatable into English.
5. Accuracy and fidelity:
The machine translation is not as accurate or faithful to the original Estonian text as the reference translation. The machine translation changes the wording of the sentence and uses more formal language, which may not be as clear or natural-sounding as the reference translation.

Overall, while the machine translation is grammatically correct, it does not capture the nuances and cultural references of the source text as well as the reference translation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating than the reference translation.

	* Machine translation: ""maksude ja kõrvaliste"" is incorrect. The correct phrase is ""maksud ja kõrvaliste"" (heavy taxes and by-persons).
	* Machine translation: ""tähtsamatele"" is incorrect. The correct phrase is ""tähtsama"" (key positions).
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""raskete"" is incorrect. The correct word is ""rakete"" (heavy).
	* Machine translation: ""isikute"" is incorrect. The correct word is ""isik"" (administrative system).
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""imposing heavy taxes and by-persons on key positions of the administrative system"" is not a natural idiomatic expression in English. A more idiomatic expression would be ""imposing heavy taxes and outsiders on key positions in the administrative system"".
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""Justinianus II"" is not translated correctly. The correct translation is ""Justinian II"".
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The translation is not very fluent, as it contains several awkward phrasings and word choices.

Based on these differences, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as low, and the reference translation as high. The reference translation is more accurate, idiomatic, and fluent than the machine translation.

	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the correct sentence structure of the Estonian original.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""igasuguseid asju"" in the Estonian original. This phrase is not easily translatable, but the reference translation gets closer to conveying its meaning.
4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation sounds more formal and less natural than the reference translation. The reference translation has a more conversational tone that better matches the style of the Estonian original.
5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the cultural reference to ""moel"" and ""tagajärgedega"" in the Estonian original. These terms are specific to Estonian culture and are not easily translatable.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. While the machine translation may be able to generate a grammatically correct sentence, it lacks the nuance and cultural context that a human translator can provide.

Machine Translation: ""In 1914 Nauru occupied the Equatorial Forces of Australia.""

Reference Translation: ""In 1914 Nauru occupied the Expedition Forces of Australia.""

The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""Equatorial Forces"" instead of ""Expedition Forces"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""occupied"" instead of the past tense ""occupied"" in the reference translation. This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame of the action being described.
3. Accuracy: The machine translation seems to have misinterpreted the word ""Nauru"" in the original sentence. In the reference translation, ""Nauru"" is correctly translated as ""Australia,"" while in the machine translation, it is translated as ""Equatorial Forces.""

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, and accuracy. The reference translation provides a more precise and accurate translation of the original sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation:

* The sentence structure is almost the same as the reference translation, but the word order is slightly different.
* The machine translation uses the phrase ""very successful"" instead of the reference translation's ""very successful .""
* The word ""olid"" in the source text is translated as ""were"" in the machine translation.

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation maintains the original word order of the source text, which is ""Väga edukad olid 1936. aasta suveolümpiamängud Berliinis.""
* The reference translation uses the word ""successful"" instead of ""very successful.""

Comparison:

* The machine translation and the reference translation have different word orders, with the machine translation placing the adverb ""very"" before the adjective ""successful."" In contrast, the reference translation places the adjective ""successful"" before the noun ""games.""
* The machine translation uses the word ""olid"" to translate the Estonian word ""edukad,"" which means ""were."" In contrast, the reference translation uses the word ""were"" to translate the same word.

Conclusion:

Based on the differences I've identified, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in this case. The machine translation changes the word order and uses a different word to translate the Estonian word ""olid."" Additionally, the machine translation uses the phrase ""very successful"" instead of the more literal translation ""successful."" Overall, the reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian text and provides a more accurate translation of the sentence.

2. Article usage: In the machine translation, the word ""ka"" (meaning ""also"") is translated as a definite article ""the"", which is not necessary in this context. In the reference translation, the word ""also"" is used instead.
3. Name translation: The machine translation translates the Estonian name ""Tony Blair"" as ""Suurbritannia peaminister Tony Blair"", which is a bit long and wordy. In the reference translation, the name is translated more concisely as ""Tony Blair"".
4. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense ""takes part"" to translate the Estonian verb ""osales"", which is in the past tense. This is a common mistake in machine translation, as the translator may not always understand the tense of the source language.

Overall, the machine translation is not very accurate in this case, as it makes several mistakes in word order, article usage, name translation, and tense. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and follows the conventions of English grammar and syntax.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""globalisation"" instead of ""the scepticism of the external world."" This is a significant difference, as ""globalisation"" refers to a broader economic, cultural, and political trend, while ""scepticism of the external world"" is a more specific term that refers to a particular type of skepticism.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""cannot be approached"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""cannot be approached in the same way""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""in the same way"" to convey the idea that the scepticism of the external world is different from the scepticism of the local culture. However, this phrase is not used in the reference translation. Instead, the reference translation uses the phrase ""samamoodi nagu välismaailmaskeptitsismile,"" which is a more idiomatic expression in Estonian.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation accurately translates the word ""skeptitsismile"" as ""scepticism,"" but the reference translation uses the more specific term ""välismaailmaskeptitsismile,"" which refers to skepticism towards the external world. This is a more accurate translation, as the original Estonian sentence is specifically referring to skepticism towards the external world.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions. However, it is important to note that machine translation is a complex task and can be affected by various factors, including the quality of the training data and the complexity of the sentence being translated. Therefore, while the machine translation is not perfect, it can still be a useful tool for getting a general idea of the meaning of a sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""Hospital"" instead of ""Town Hall"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is"") to describe the location of the restoration work, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was""). This is a more accurate reflection of the original Estonian sentence, which is in the past tense.
3. Noun agreement: In the machine translation, the noun ""restoration work"" is not in agreement with the gender of the previous noun ""war"". In Estonian, the gender of the noun ""restoration work"" is feminine, so it should be in agreement with the gender of the previous noun ""war"", which is also feminine.
4. Word order: The machine translation puts the prepositional phrase ""after the war"" at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation places it after the verb ""started"". This is a matter of style and personal preference, but the reference translation is more idiomatic in Estonian.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""sõda"" (meaning ""war"") at the beginning of the sentence, which is a common way to refer to the Second World War in Estonian.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions. While the machine translation is understandable, it does not convey the same level of detail and nuance as the reference translation. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation.

Step 1: Identify the differences between the source text and the machine translation.

The source text is: ""Meiesugused olendid aga, kes ängiga teadvustavad oma lõplikkust, tunnistavad üldiselt, et ei saa niisugust hoolimatut heldust endale lubada.""

The machine translation is: ""However, we like ourselves, who are aware of their finality with the game, generally recognise that such reckless generosity cannot be tolerated.""

The differences between the two are:

1. Word choice: In the source text, ""meiesugused"" is used instead of ""beings"" in the machine translation.
2. Grammar: In the source text, the verb ""tunnistavad"" is in the infinitive form, while in the machine translation, it is in the past tense.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""such reckless generosity"" instead of the Estonian phrase ""hoolimatut heldust endale lubada"".
4. Word order: In the source text, the sentence structure is different, with the verb ""tunnistavad"" appearing before the subject ""meiesugused"". In the machine translation, the word order is reversed.

Step 2: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has several errors and inaccuracies:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""game"" instead of the Estonian word ""olendid"", which is the correct term in this context.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the past tense ""recognise"" instead of the present tense ""recognise"" in the source text.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the nuance of the Estonian phrase ""hoolimatut heldust endale lubada"", which means something like ""excessive generosity that is not sustainable"".
4. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, which can make it difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is of poor quality and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text.

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.

The reference translation is: ""However, beings like ourselves , who are uneasily aware of their finality , generally recognise that they cannot afford such reckless generosity.""

The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. It uses the correct word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions to convey the meaning of the source text.

Conclusion:

Based on the evaluation, the machine translation is of poor quality and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and idiomatic, and provides a better translation of the Estonian text.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Ekraaninstinct"" is translated as ""Ekraaninäitlejate"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""Screen Actors Guild"". This is a difference in vocabulary choice, as ""Ekraaninstinct"" is not a commonly used term in English.
	* Machine translation: ""filminäitlejate"" is translated as ""filmmakers"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""Screen Actors Guild"". This is another difference in vocabulary choice, as ""filminäitlejate"" is not a commonly used term in English.
2. Grammar and sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation says ""The 2007 Film Awards ceremony of Gildi, the Ekraaninstinct trade union of film-makers, was held in Los Angeles, the United States of America."" while the reference translation says ""The 2007 Film Awards ceremony of the Screen Actors Guild was held in Los Angeles, the United States of America.""
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the present tense for the verb ""was held"" in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense. This is a difference in grammar choice.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""the United States of America"" in the sentence, while the reference translation does. This is a difference in idiomatic expression choice.
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Ekraaninstinct"" as ""Ekraaninäitlejate"". This is an error in accuracy.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in vocabulary choice, grammar and sentence structure, and accuracy. The reference translation is more accurate and uses more idiomatic expressions, while the machine translation uses more complex sentence structures and makes errors in vocabulary choice.

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a score of 3 out of 10, while the reference translation would receive a score of 8 out of 10. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, word choice, and idiomatic expressions, which affect the overall quality of the translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""surgical"" (instead of ""bright"")
		+ The machine translation uses the word ""surgical"" to describe the clothing colours, which doesn't quite fit the context. The word ""bright"" would be a better choice to convey the idea of vivid or striking colours.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""while the 14th century shelf dogs are in the classic style of the Palaiologisation period."" (instead of ""while the 14th century frescos are in the classic style of the Palaiologos period"")
		+ The machine translation uses the phrase ""shelf dogs"" instead of ""frescos"", which is the correct term for the artworks in question. Additionally, the machine translation uses the term ""Palaiologisation period"" instead of ""Palaiologos period"", which is the correct term for the historical period.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""on kirkad"" (instead of ""on freskod"")
		+ The machine translation uses the phrase ""on kirkad"" to describe the location of the artworks, which doesn't quite fit the context. The correct phrase to use would be ""on freskod"", which means ""on frescoes"".
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Clothing colours are surgical, while the 14th century shelf dogs are in the classic style of the Palaiologisation period."" (instead of ""Clothing colours are bright, while the 14th century frescos are in the classic style of the Palaiologos period"")
		+ The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, which can make it harder to understand. The correct word order for the reference translation is ""Clothing colours are bright, while the 14th century frescos are in the classic style of the Palaiologos period"".

Overall, the machine translation has several errors that can make it difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic, and it better conveys the intended meaning of the original Estonian sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""died"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses ""died in the attack"" in the first instance and ""died"" in the second instance. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and readability of the translation.
2. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a more simplified phrase structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence is structured as ""At least 8 people died in the attack,"" while the reference translation uses ""At least 8 people died, including 4 foreigners."" The reference translation uses a more complex phrase structure, which may make the sentence more difficult to understand for some readers.
3. Word order: The machine translation and the reference translation differ in their word order. In the machine translation, the words ""at least"" and ""8 people"" come before the verb ""died,"" while in the reference translation, they come after the verb. This difference in word order may affect the emphasis and the overall meaning of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""died in the attack."" This difference may affect the naturalness and fluency of the translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present simple tense throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense in the second instance. This difference in verb tense may affect the time frame in which the action of the sentence takes place.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation differ in their word choice, phrase structure, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. While the machine translation is generally clear and understandable, there are some differences in the way the sentence is structured and the words used that may affect its accuracy and naturalness.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""France held its first television debate on the six main presidential candidates.""
	* Reference translation: ""France held its first television debate of the six main presidential candidates.""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""on the six main presidential candidates"" instead of ""of the six main presidential candidates."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference translation is more accurate, as it uses the correct preposition ""of"" to indicate that the debate involved all six candidates.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Prantsusmaal toimus kuue peamise presidendikandidaadi esimene teledebatt.""
	* Reference translation: ""France held its first television debate of the six main presidential candidates.""

The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""Prantsusmaal toimus"" instead of the English phrase ""France held."" This is a significant difference, as it affects the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference translation uses the correct English phrase ""France held"" to indicate that the debate took place in France.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kuue peamise presidendikandidaadi esimene teledebatt.""
	* Reference translation: ""France held its first television debate of the six main presidential candidates.""

The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""kuue peamise presidendikandidaadi"" instead of the English phrase ""six main presidential candidates."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference translation uses the correct English phrase ""six main presidential candidates"" to indicate the number of candidates involved in the debate.

4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Prantsusmaal toimus kuue peamise presidendikandidaadi esimene teledebatt.""
	* Reference translation: ""France held its first television debate of the six main presidential candidates.""

The machine translation and the reference translation have different sentence structures. The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure, with multiple clauses, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a single main clause.

Based on these differences, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as moderate, with some minor errors in word choice, grammar, and sentence structure. The reference translation, on the other hand, is of high quality, with accurate word choice, grammar, and sentence structure.

	* Machine translation: ""Eetiliste dispositsioonide kujunemine on inimestel looduslik"" (The development of ethical positions is natural for people)
	* Reference translation: ""The development of ethical dispositions is natural for people"" (no changes made)

Both the machine translation and the reference translation use the same sentence structure and word order, which is correct. However, the machine translation uses the word ""inimestel"" (people) instead of ""people"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall readability and flow of the sentence.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""kuigi vajab kasvatust"" (even though they need upbringing)
	* Reference translation: ""even though it requires upbringing""

The machine translation uses the word ""vajab"" (need) instead of ""requires"" in the reference translation. While both words convey the same meaning, ""vajab"" is a more informal and conversational term in Estonian, while ""requires"" is more formal and neutral.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""katkeb konventsiooni"" (and are associated with the Convention)
	* Reference translation: ""entails convention""

The machine translation uses the word ""katkeb"" (and are associated with) instead of ""entails"" in the reference translation. While both words convey the same meaning, ""katkeb"" is a more formal and technical term in Estonian, while ""entails"" is more common and natural in English.

4. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kujunemine"" (development)
	* Reference translation: ""dispositions""

The machine translation uses the word ""kujunemine"" (development) instead of ""dispositions"" in the reference translation. While both words can be translated as ""development,"" ""kujunemine"" has a more specific meaning in Estonian, referring to the process of developing ethical principles or values.

5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""looduslik"" (natural)
	* Reference translation: ""natural""

The machine translation uses the word ""looduslik"" (natural) instead of ""natural"" in the reference translation. While both words convey the same meaning, ""looduslik"" has a more nuanced connotation in Estonian, implying a deeper connection to nature or the environment.

Overall, the machine translation makes some minor errors in grammar, vocabulary, and word choice, which can affect the overall quality of the translation. However, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding, with better word choices and a more formal tone.

	* Reference translation: ""any such further and more specific definitions do not leave being any longer the pure being"" - The sentence structure is more natural and the use of ""being"" is clearer.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""niisugused"" (definitions) is translated as ""such further and more specific definitions"" which is a bit awkward and doesn't convey the same meaning.
	* Reference translation: ""määratlused"" (definitions) is used instead of ""niisugused"" which is a more accurate translation.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""leave it out of existence"" is not a natural expression in English and doesn't convey the same meaning as ""leave being any longer"".
	* Reference translation: ""leave being any longer"" is a more natural expression in English and conveys the same meaning as ""eesti olemiseks"".
4. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""puhtaks"" (pure) is translated as "" existence"" which is not the best choice in this context.
	* Reference translation: ""pure being"" is a more accurate translation of ""puhtaks"" in this context.
5. Fluency:

	* Machine translation: ""lies"" (in the sentence ""Maintaining an ethical value lies in the reproduction of ethical positions."")
	* Reference translation: ""dispositions"" (in the sentence ""Maintaining ethical value lies in the reproduction of ethical dispositions."")

The machine translation uses the word ""lies"" to convey the idea of a state or condition, while the reference translation uses ""dispositions"" to convey the idea of a mental or moral attitude.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""seisneb"" (in the sentence ""Eetilise väärtuse säilitamine seisneb eetiliste dispositsioonide taastootmises."")
	* Reference translation: ""maintaining"" (in the sentence ""Maintaining ethical value lies in the reproduction of ethical dispositions."")

The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""seisneb,"" which can be translated to ""maintaining"" in English.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""eetilise väärtuse"" (in the sentence ""Eetilise väärtuse säilitamine seisneb eetiliste dispositsioonide taastootmises."")
	* Reference translation: ""ethical value"" (in the sentence ""Maintaining ethical value lies in the reproduction of ethical dispositions."")

The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""eetilise väärtuse,"" which can be translated to ""ethical value"" in English.

2. Word choice:

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""objektiivse"" which means ""objective"" in English, while the reference translation uses the English word ""diameter"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source Text: Tõenäoliselt katsetati seekord sõjalaevade uputamiseks mõeldud rakette.
Machine Translation: Probably this time there was a test of the wrecks intended for the sinking of warships.
Reference Translation: Probably this time there was a test of rockets intended for the sinking of warships.

Difference 1: Word Choice (lexical accuracy)

The machine translation uses the word ""wrecks"" instead of ""rakette"" in the source text. ""Wrecks"" refers to a ship that has been damaged or destroyed, whereas ""rakette"" means ""rocket"" in Estonian. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Difference 2: Grammar and Sentence Structure

The machine translation keeps the same sentence structure as the source text, but it changes the verb tense. In the source text, the verb is in the past tense (katsetati), while in the machine translation, it's in the present tense (probably). This can make the sentence sound less natural and less accurate.

Difference 3: Idiomatic Expressions

The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression used in the source text. In Estonian, the phrase ""sõjalaevade uputamiseks"" means ""for the sinking of warships,"" which is a common idiomatic expression used to describe the testing of weapons or equipment for military use. The machine translation doesn't convey this meaning, instead using the literal translation of ""wrecks"" which doesn't have the same connotation.

Difference 4: Cultural References

The machine translation doesn't take into account cultural references that are specific to Estonian or the military context. For example, the phrase ""sõjalaevade uputamiseks"" is a cultural reference that is specific to Estonian and the military context. The machine translation doesn't capture this cultural nuance, which can make the translation sound less natural and less accurate.

Conclusion:

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, sentence structure, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. While the machine translation captures some of the basic meaning of the source text, it lacks the nuance and cultural context that is present in the reference translation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating than the reference translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""This artillery"" vs. Reference translation: ""The commanders of the artillery"" - The machine translation uses a more general term for ""artillery"" (“this artillery”), while the reference translation uses a more specific term (“commanders of the artillery”) to indicate that the demand was coming from the leaders of the artillery unit.
2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""was persistently demanded"" vs. Reference translation: ""tended to hinder"" - The machine translation uses the past tense (""was persistently demanded"") to indicate that the demand happened in the past, while the reference translation uses the present tense (""tends to hinder"") to indicate that the hindrance is ongoing.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""seda suurtükiväe ülemad"" vs. Reference translation: ""their movement"" - The machine translation places the object of the verb ""demanded"" after the verb (""seda suurtükiväe ülemad""), while the reference translation places it before the verb (""their movement"").
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""takistama"" vs. Reference translation: ""hinder"" - The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""takistama"", which means ""to block"" or ""to obstruct"", while the reference translation uses the English word ""hinder"".
5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""nende liikumist"" vs. Reference translation: ""their movement"" - The machine translation uses the Estonian genitive case (""nende liikumist"") to indicate possession, while the reference translation uses the English genitive case (""their movement"").

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, tense, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar.

	* Difference: Both translations are in the present tense, but the machine translation uses the past tense verb form ""had already invented"" instead of the present perfect tense ""had invented"". This difference is minor, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word order:

	* Reference translation: ""He now contested the granting of the patent""
	* Difference: The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, placing ""vaidlustas"" before ""ta patendi"". This can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the emphasis is shifted from the act of contesting to the thing being contested.
4. Idiomatic expressions:

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""juba varem leiutanud"", which is not a direct translation of the English phrase ""before"". This can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the Estonian phrase has a different connotation.
5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""He has now contested the granting of a patent, claiming that he had already invented the same method before.""
	* Reference translation: ""He now contested the granting of the patent, claiming that he had already invented the same method before.""

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""head"" instead of ""confused"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. In the reference translation, ""confused"" better conveys the idea that Aristotle was disoriented or perplexed, whereas ""head"" could suggest that he was simply looking in a particular direction.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""so"") to describe Aristotle's state, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""had""). This difference in tense can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as it implies that Aristotle's confusion occurred at a different time in the past.
3. Word order: The machine translation rearranges the word order in the sentence, placing ""Aristotle"" before ""so"" instead of after it. This can make the sentence feel less natural and more awkward to read.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""ride on his back"" to convey the idea of Aristotle being carried or supported by Phyllis.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""This is what Mikhail Botvinners became in 1948 the first most important world champion of the Soviet Union."" (incorrect use of ""most important"")
	* Reference translation: ""This is how Mikhail Botvinnik became in 1948 the first chess world champion of the Soviet Union."" (correct use of ""chess world champion"")
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Mikhail Botvinners"" (incorrect word choice, should be ""Mikhail Botvinnik"")
	* Reference translation: ""Mikhail Botvinnik""
3. Punctuation:
	* Machine translation: No punctuation after ""most important""
	* Reference translation: ""This is how Mikhail Botvinnik became in 1948 the first chess world champion of the Soviet Union."" (correct use of punctuation)
4. Idiomatic expressions:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""New Orthodox"" (machine translation) vs. ""New Orleans"" (reference translation)
		+ The machine translation uses a non-standard term ""New Orthodox"" instead of the standard ""New Orleans"". This may be due to a misunderstanding of the source text or a lack of context.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Ameerika Ühendriikides valiti"" (machine translation) vs. ""In the United States"" (reference translation)
		+ The machine translation uses the plural form of the word ""America"" instead of the singular form ""United States"". This may be due to a mistake in the machine learning algorithm.
3. Phrase structure:
	* Machine translation: ""kelle poolt andis hääle 52,4% valimas käinud kodanikest"" (machine translation) vs. ""for whom 52.4% of the citizens who went to vote voted"" (reference translation)
		+ The machine translation uses a different phrase structure than the reference translation. The machine translation separates the phrase ""kelle poolt"" (his/her vote) from ""andis hääle"", which may make the sentence less clear.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""käinud kodanikest"" (machine translation) vs. ""voted"" (reference translation)
		+ The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""käinud"", which means ""to vote"", but it may not be the most idiomatic or natural way to express this idea in English.
5. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Ray Nagin, kelle poolt andis hääle 52,4% valimas"" (machine translation) vs. ""Ray Nagin was re-elected mayor of New Orleans by 52.4% of the citizens who went to vote"" (reference translation)
		+ The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, which may make it less clear or less natural-sounding in English.

Overall, the machine translation has several errors and inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English, and it better conveys the meaning of the original Estonian sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Mathematics have also developed tools for hydrodynamics and theory for language learning, for example.""
	* Reference translation: ""Mathematicians have also developed tools, for instance, for the theories of hydrodynamics and language vibration.""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""tools for hydrodynamics and theory for language learning"" to translate the Estonian phrase ""hydrodünaamika ja keele võnkumise teooria tarvis."" The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the phrase ""tools, for instance, for the theories of hydrodynamics and language vibration"" to better convey the meaning of the original text. The reference translation uses more specific and accurate words to convey the meaning of the Estonian phrase, which is why it is considered a better translation.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Mathematics have also developed tools for hydrodynamics and theory for language learning, for example.""
	* Reference translation: ""Mathematicians have also developed tools, for instance, for the theories of hydrodynamics and language vibration.""

The machine translation uses the present tense ""have also developed"" to translate the Estonian verb ""töötasid,"" which is in the past tense. This is a common mistake in machine translation, as the algorithm may not always be able to accurately determine the tense of the source language. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the past tense ""have also developed"" to match the tense of the Estonian verb.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Mathematics have also developed tools for hydrodynamics and theory for language learning, for example.""
	* Reference translation: ""Mathematicians have also developed tools, for instance, for the theories of hydrodynamics and language vibration.""

The machine translation uses a different word order than the reference translation. The machine translation places the verb ""have"" at the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation places it after the subject ""mathematicians."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and readability of the translation.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Mathematics have also developed tools for hydrodynamics and theory for language learning, for example.""
	* Reference translation: ""Mathematicians have also developed tools, for instance, for the theories of hydrodynamics and language vibration.""

The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the Estonian original. For example, the phrase ""hydrodünaamika ja keele võnkumise teooria tarvis"" is an idiomatic expression in Estonian that means ""the theories of hydrodynamics and language vibration."" The reference translation, on the other hand, uses more idiomatic expressions to convey the meaning of the original text.

Overall, the reference translation is considered a better translation than the machine translation because it uses more accurate and idiomatic expressions to convey the meaning of the Estonian original. The machine translation, on the other hand, makes several errors in word choice, grammar, and word order that can affect the clarity and readability of the translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""keeruline"" (difficult) instead of the reference translation's ""kes samuti kaotasid"" (difficult for the Danes). This suggests that the machine translation may not have fully captured the nuance of the original Estonian sentence.
2. Tense agreement: The machine translation uses the past tense ""lost"" to describe the Danes' holdings, while the reference translation uses the present tense ""lost most of their holdings"". This difference may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation places the word ""who"" at the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation places it after the verb ""lost"". This difference in word order may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as it changes the emphasis of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""suurema osa"" (most of), which is included in the reference translation. This may indicate that the machine translation is not able to capture the cultural and linguistic nuances of the original sentence.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""lost"" in the singular form, while the reference translation uses the plural form ""lost most of their holdings"". This difference may indicate that the machine translation is not able to accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have significant differences in terms of word choice, tense agreement, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. These differences suggest that the machine translation may not be as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more reliable and accurate translation of the original Estonian sentence.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source Text: Tõepoolest, vandenõu sai tuntuks kui ""Botta vandenõu"".
Machine Translation: Indeed, the conspiracy became known as' Botta Conspiracy '.
Reference Translation: Indeed , the conspiracy became known as ' Botta Conspiracy ' .

Comparison:

* The source text uses the phrase ""Tõepoolest, vandenõu sai tuntuks kui"", which means ""Indeed, the conspiracy became known as"".
* The machine translation replicates this phrase almost verbatim, using the same words and phrasing.
* The reference translation also replicates this phrase, but with a slight variation in wording. Instead of using ""kui"", which means ""as"", the reference translation uses ""kuna"", which means ""because"".

Differences:

* The machine translation uses the phrase ""Botta Conspiracy "", which is not found in the source text or the reference translation. This suggests that the machine translation may have introduced a term that is not present in the original text.
* The reference translation uses the phrase ""Botta vandenõu"", which is a slight variation of the source text. This variation may be due to a difference in translation style or a deliberate choice to use a different phrase.

Conclusion:

Based on this analysis, it appears that the machine translation and reference translation are similar in their overall structure and wording, but there are some differences in the specific phrasing and terminology used. The machine translation introduces a new term, ""Botta Conspiracy "", which is not present in the source text or the reference translation. The reference translation uses a slight variation of the source text, ""Botta vandenõu"". Overall, the quality of the translation is moderate, with some minor differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""In Luxembourg"" comes at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it comes after the verb ""began"". This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machines often struggle to maintain the same word order as the source language.
2. Article usage: The machine translation omits the definite article ""the"" before ""EU foreign ministers"", while the reference translation includes it. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation.
3. Name translation: The machine translation translates the Estonian name ""Marina Kaljurand"" as ""Marina Kaljurand"" in both the source and target languages, while the reference translation translates it as ""Marina Kaljurand"" in the source language and ""Kaljurand Marina"" in the target language. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the consistency of the translation.
4. Punctuation: The machine translation adds a comma after ""including"" to separate the two clauses in the sentence, while the reference translation does not. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the clarity and readability of the translation.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""meeting"" in both the source and target languages, while the reference translation uses the word ""conference"" in the target language. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the accuracy and nuance of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word order, article usage, name translation, punctuation, and word choice. While the machine translation is generally understandable, the reference translation is more accurate and nuanced in its translation. As a helpful assistant, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for any further translations or communications.

	* Reference translation: ""Soble does not want to claim""

The machine translation uses the Estonian verb form ""taha"" which is the third person singular present tense, while the reference translation uses the English verb form ""want to claim"".

3. Idiomatic expressions:

The machine translation uses the phrase ""pärast kiilu maha panekut"" which means ""after the roof had been put down"". However, the reference translation uses the phrase ""kiilu maha panekut"" which means ""keel had been laid"". This difference in word choice may be due to a misunderstanding of the Estonian sentence structure or a lack of knowledge of nautical terms.

2. Tense:

Reference Translation: The previous snowfall in Nepal 's capital city was 63 years earlier.

Difference 1: Word order

The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""in Nepal's capital city"" after ""snow"" instead of before it. This is a common mistake in machine translation, as it can struggle to preserve the original word order in complex sentences.

Difference 2: Article usage

In the machine translation, the article ""the"" is missing before ""snow"". In Estonian, the definite article ""the"" is used before nouns that are specific or previously mentioned, so it should be included in the translation.

Difference 3: Tense agreement

The machine translation uses the past tense ""was"" instead of the past perfect tense ""had been"" to describe the duration of the snow. While both tenses can be used to express a past duration, the past perfect tense is more appropriate in this context to show that the snow had fallen for a specific period of time.

Difference 4: Word choice

The machine translation uses the word ""pealinnas"" instead of ""capital city"". While both words can be used to refer to the main city of a country or region, ""pealinnas"" has a more formal connotation and may not be as commonly used in informal speech or writing.

Difference 5: Grammar

The machine translation uses the verb ""leidis"" instead of ""fell"" to describe the snow. While both verbs can be used to describe the act of snow falling, ""leidis"" is more commonly used in Estonian to refer to a longer duration of snow cover or snowfall.

Overall, the machine translation makes several errors in word order, article usage, tense agreement, word choice, and grammar. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and idiomatic, using the appropriate verb forms and word order to convey the intended meaning.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation: ""But how can we know that this general principle is true?""

* The sentence structure is slightly different in the machine translation, with a more abrupt transition from the previous sentence.
* The word order in the machine translation is also different, with ""how can we know"" instead of ""but how can we know"" in the reference translation.
* The phrase ""this general principle"" is translated as ""this general principle is true"" in the machine translation, which is a bit awkward and doesn't convey the same meaning as the reference translation.
* The word ""true"" is also translated differently in the machine translation, with ""tõene"" instead of ""true"".

Reference Translation: ""But how can we know that this general principle is true?""

* The sentence structure is the same in both translations.
* The word order is also the same, with ""but how can we know"" in both translations.
* The phrase ""this general principle"" is translated correctly in both translations.
* The word ""true"" is translated correctly in both translations, with ""tõene"" in the reference translation and ""true"" in the machine translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in this case. The machine translation changes the word order, uses an awkward phrase, and translates ""true"" differently. These errors can make the translation sound less natural and less accurate.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Doubts are also disciplined in the moral meaning of what has been done."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Regret is also disciplined remembering of the moral significance of what has been done."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong verb form in the second sentence, which results in an awkward and unnatural sentence structure. The reference translation correctly uses the past participle form of the verb ""discipline"" to match the tense of the sentence.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""what has been done"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""what has been done"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the singular form of the pronoun ""what,"" which doesn't match the context of the sentence. The reference translation uses the plural form to match the plural noun ""actions.""

3. Idiomatic expressions:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""sabotaged"" (machine translation) vs. ""sabotaged at night"" (reference translation)
	* The machine translation uses the word ""sabotaged"" as a single word, while the reference translation uses ""sabotaged at night"" to provide more context and clarify the time frame of the action.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Prantsusmaa raudteeoperaator SNCF"" (machine translation) vs. ""The French rail operator SNCF"" (reference translation)
	* The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""Prantsusmaa"" (which means ""France"") instead of the English word ""French"".
	* The reference translation uses the English word ""rail operator"" instead of the Estonian word ""raudteeoperaator"".
3. Phrasing:
	* Machine translation: ""teatas, et öösel oli sabotaged"" (machine translation) vs. ""the express train network, TGV, had been sabotaged"" (reference translation)
	* The machine translation uses a different phrasing than the reference translation. The machine translation uses ""teatas, et öösel oli"" (which means ""at night"") instead of ""the express train network, TGV"" in the reference translation.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kiirrongide võrgustikku"" (machine translation) vs. ""express train network"" (reference translation)
	* The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""kiirrongide"" (which means ""sabotaged"") instead of the English idiomatic expression ""express train network"".
5. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""TGV had been sabotaged"" (machine translation) vs. ""the express train network, TGV, had been sabotaged"" (reference translation)
	* The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation uses more literal translations and doesn't take into account the nuances of English grammar and phrasing. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more natural and idiomatic translation of the Estonian sentence.

Machine Translation:

* ""Two soldiers were injured and brought to Tshinvali haiglasse.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Two soldiers were injured and brought to Tskhinvali hospital for treatment.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""haiglasse"" instead of ""hospital"". This is a common mistake in machine translation, as it often struggles to understand the nuances of proper nouns and their translations.
2. Accentuation: In Estonian, the word ""soldiers"" is accented on the second syllable (soldäité), but in the machine translation, it's accented on the first syllable (soldäirit). This can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""were injured"") instead of the past tense (""were injured and brought"") in the reference translation. This is a common error in machine translation, as it can struggle to understand the tense of the source language.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""Tshinvali"" before ""haiglasse"" instead of after it. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less idiomatic in English.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. It makes several errors in word choice, accentuation, grammar, and word order, which can affect the overall meaning and readability of the sentence. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""features"" instead of ""character traits"" in the reference translation. While ""features"" can also refer to physical or mental characteristics of a person, it may not convey the same level of nuance as ""character traits,"" which implies a more complex and multi-faceted understanding of a person's personality.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""he likes"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""he did like""). This difference may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it can affect the way the sentence is perceived by the reader.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, placing ""Neither"" at the beginning instead of at the end. While this is a common feature of machine translation, it can sometimes result in a less natural-sounding sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""inimrasside iseloomujooni üldistatakse,"" which means ""the character traits of the human race are generalised."" The machine translation does not use an equivalent idiomatic expression, instead opting for a more literal translation of ""Neither did he like the features of the human race being generalised."" While both translations are grammatically correct, the idiomatic expression in the reference translation may be more natural-sounding for an English-speaking reader.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""to like"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""did like"" in the past tense. This difference may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it can affect the way the sentence is perceived by the reader.

Overall, while both translations are grammatically correct, the reference translation is more natural-sounding and conveys a more nuanced understanding of the original Estonian sentence.

The machine translation uses the word ""huvid"" (interests) instead of ""kõigist"" (all interests), which is the correct word in this context. Additionally, the reference translation uses the word ""precious self"" instead of ""self,"" which is a more idiomatic expression in English.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation struggles to convey the idiomatic expression ""put the precious self aside"" in a natural way. The reference translation uses a more common and natural expression in English.
4. Cultural references:
The machine translation does not capture the cultural reference to Kant's philosophy in the reference translation. The reference translation uses the name of the philosopher Kant to add context and meaning to the sentence.
5. Fluency:
The machine translation sounds less fluent and natural compared to the reference translation. The reference translation flows better and is more easily understandable in English.

Based on these analyses, I would give the machine translation a lower rating compared to the reference translation. The machine translation has some grammatical errors, inaccurate vocabulary choices, and struggles to convey idiomatic expressions in a natural way. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate, natural, and culturally relevant.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kuulsuste"" (rumours) vs. Reference translation: ""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame""
	* Machine translation: ""tähistas"" (celebrated) vs. Reference translation: ""celebrated its 25th anniversary""
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""On 30 October, the role of rock 'n' celebrated its 25th anniversary with a group of rumours."" vs. Reference translation: ""On 30 October, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert.""
	* Machine translation: Incorrect use of the verb ""celebrated"" in the present perfect tense. The correct usage would be ""had celebrated"" to indicate that the anniversary had already passed.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kuulsuste hall oma"" vs. Reference translation: ""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame""
	* Machine translation: Incorrect use of the phrase ""kuulsuste hall oma"" which means ""rumours about something"" in Estonian. The correct phrase for ""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"" is ""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"".
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""tähistas"" vs. Reference translation: ""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame""
	* Machine translation: Incorrect translation of ""tähistas"" which means ""celebrated"" in Estonian. The correct translation for ""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"" is ""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"".

Based on the above analysis, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and accuracy. The machine translation makes several errors in the translation, including the use of the wrong verb tense, incorrect idiomatic expressions, and inaccurate word choice. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating compared to the reference translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Every single thing"" is translated as ""Iga asja"" in Estonian, but the word choice in the machine translation is not accurate. In Estonian, ""iga asja"" means ""everything"" or ""all things"", not ""single thing"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the more accurate word choice ""ultimate specificity"" instead of ""latest specificity"".
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure in the machine translation is not accurate. The Estonian sentence ""Selle viimses konkreetsuses käsitas Herakleito igavese kaose ja sõja looduna"" is translated as ""Herakleito to be an eternal story of chaos and war"" in the machine translation, which is not a correct translation of the Estonian sentence.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the correct sentence structure in Estonian, which is ""Herakleito sees every single thing..."".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""kaose ja sõja looduna"" in the Estonian sentence, which means ""in this chaos and war"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation includes the idiomatic expression ""kaose ja sõja looduna"" in the translation, which is more accurate than the machine translation.
4. Tone:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation gives a more literal translation of the Estonian sentence, which results in a less natural-sounding translation in English.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation captures the tone of the Estonian sentence better, using phrases like ""eternal chaos and war"" to convey a sense of continuity and repetition.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Estonian sentence better, including the idiomatic expressions and the tone of the original text.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation uses a more simplified word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the prepositional phrase ""in Bratislava, Slovakia"" is placed after the verb ""took place,"" while in the reference translation, it is placed before the verb.
2. Article usage: The machine translation omits the definite article ""the"" before ""Bratislava"" and ""Slovakia,"" while the reference translation includes it.
3. Plural nouns: The machine translation consistently uses the plural form of nouns, while the reference translation uses the singular form in some cases, such as ""consultations"" and ""Ministries.""
4. Verb tenses: The machine translation uses the present tense for the verb ""took place,"" while the reference translation uses the past tense.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""kahepoolsed"" (bilateral) instead of ""bilateral"" in the reference translation.
6. Punctuation: The machine translation lacks the comma after ""Slovakia"" in the reference translation.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, article usage, plural nouns, verb tenses, and word choice. However, it's worth noting that machine translation can be a useful tool for getting a general sense of the meaning of a text, and it may be more accurate than a non-professional translation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

1. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""Attended by"" at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb ""was held"". In the reference translation, the word order is maintained, with ""Attended by"" appearing after the verb ""was held"".
2. Article usage: The machine translation omits the definite article ""the"" before ""Crisis Committee"", while the reference translation includes it.
3. Name spelling: The machine translation spells the name of the Estonian Government official ""Aaviker"" instead of ""Aaviksoo"", which is the correct spelling.
4. Punctuation: The machine translation adds a comma after ""Aaviker"" to separate the name from the rest of the sentence, while the reference translation does not use a comma.
5. Capitalization: The machine translation does not capitalize the first word of the sentence ""Crisis Committee"", while the reference translation does.
6. Translation of ""osalesid"": The machine translation translates ""osalesid"" as ""of the Estonian Government"", while the reference translation translates it as ""Attended by"".
7. Translation of ""Jüri Pihl"": The machine translation translates ""Jüri Pihl"" as ""Jüri Pihl, Andrus Ansip and Jaak Aaviksoo"", while the reference translation translates it as ""Chairman of the Committee Jüri Pihl"".
8. Translation of ""Andrus Ansip"": The machine translation translates ""Andrus Ansip"" as ""Andrus Ansip and Jaak Aaviker of the Estonian Government"", while the reference translation translates it as ""Andrus Ansip"".
9. Translation of ""Jaak Aaviksoo"": The machine translation translates ""Jaak Aaviksoo"" as ""Jaak Aaviker of the Estonian Government"", while the reference translation translates it as ""Jaak Aaviksoo"".

Overall, the machine translation makes several errors in spelling, punctuation, and translation, which can affect the clarity and accuracy of the message. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and polished translation of the original Estonian sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation:

* ""If the animal has not been given a moral, where has that come from?""

Reference Translation:

* ""If morality is not given by the Creator, where has it come from?""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""moral"" instead of ""morality"". This is a common difference between machine translations and reference translations, as machine translations may not always capture the nuances of language and cultural context.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""has"") and the past tense (""come from"") in different places, which can make the sentence sound less natural and less idiomatic in English. In contrast, the reference translation uses the present tense throughout the sentence to maintain consistency.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""given by the Creator"" to convey the idea that morality comes from a higher power. The machine translation does not use this idiomatic expression, instead using a more literal translation of ""looja"" (Creator).
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing the verb ""has"" before the subject ""animal"". In Estonian, the word order is typically SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), so the reference translation maintains this word order to make the sentence sound more natural in English.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and word order. While the machine translation may be adequate for basic communication, it is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""autojuhtimine"" (ambulances)
	* Reference translation: ""vehicle""

The machine translation uses the word ""autojuhtimine"" which is the Estonian word for ""ambulances"". However, in the reference translation, the word ""vehicle"" is used instead. This difference may be due to the fact that ""autojuhtimine"" has a more specific meaning in Estonian, referring specifically to a vehicle used for transporting patients, while ""vehicle"" is a more general term that can refer to any type of transportation.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""kiirabitehniku"" (tasks)
	* Reference translation: ""tasks of an emergency medical technician""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""kiirabitehniku ülesannetest"" which means ""nowadays, driving is only part of the tasks"". However, in the reference translation, the phrase ""tasks of an emergency medical technician"" is used instead. This difference may be due to the fact that the reference translation is trying to convey a more specific meaning, that driving is only one of the tasks of an emergency medical technician, while the machine translation is simply translating the phrase as ""tasks"".

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kiirabitehniku ülesannetest"" (nowadays, driving is only part of the tasks)
	* Reference translation: ""Nowadays, driving the vehicle is only part of the tasks of an emergency medical technician""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""kiirabitehniku ülesannetest"" which is a more literal translation of the Estonian phrase, but it may not be as idiomatic or natural-sounding in English.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions. While the machine translation is able to translate the basic meaning of the Estonian sentence, it may not always produce the most natural-sounding or idiomatic English translation.

2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""proposes"" instead of the infinitive form ""propose"" in the source text. This is a minor error.
3. Phrasing: The machine translation uses a more formal and literal translation of the sentence, while the reference translation uses a more natural and idiomatic phrasing. For example, the machine translation uses ""an idea of observation"" instead of ""examination"".

Reference Translation: ""Murdoch proposeerib lisada tähelepanemise, vaatamise idee.""

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Siis on Frankfurtil õigus, aga Williams ei pidanud silmas seda."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Then Frankfurt is right, but Williams did not mean that."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the incorrect word order in the sentence, which is a common mistake in Estonian-English translation. The correct word order in Estonian is ""Frankfurtil õigus, aga Williams pidanud silmas seda.""

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Williams ei pidanud silmas seda."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""But Williams did not mean that."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong word ""pidanud"" (meaning ""he did not mean"") instead of ""meant"" in the reference translation.

3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Siis on Frankfurtil õigus, aga Williams ei pidanud silmas seda."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Then Frankfurt is right, but Williams did not mean that."" (correct)

The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""Frankfurtil õigus"" in the reference translation. This is a common issue in machine translation, as idioms and expressions can be difficult to translate accurately.

4. Context:
	* Machine translation: ""Siis on Frankfurtil õigus, aga Williams ei pidanud silmas seda."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Then Frankfurt is right, but Williams did not mean that."" (correct)

The machine translation does not take into account the context of the sentence, which is that Williams did not mean what he said. The reference translation captures this contextual information accurately.

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a score of 2/5, while the reference translation scores a 5/5. The machine translation makes several significant errors in grammar, vocabulary, idioms, and context, which affect the overall quality of the translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""täiuslikkuse vahendusel"" (perfection in order to correct)
	* Reference translation: ""täiuslikkuse miste"" (perfection in order to correct)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""vahendusel"" (meaning ""in order to correct"") instead of ""miste"" (meaning ""mistake""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""et parandada tema eksitust"" (and correct his miscarriage)
	* Reference translation: ""et parandada tema eksitusi"" (and correct his mistake)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb ""parandada"" (meaning ""to correct"") in the accusative case, while the reference translation uses the verb ""parandada"" in the nominative case. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the sentence structure and meaning.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""tulnud tema juurde"" (came to him directly)
	* Reference translation: ""tulnud häälest"" (came to him)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""tulnud tema juurde"" (meaning ""came to him directly""), while the reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic expression ""tulnud häälest"" (meaning ""came to him"").
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""His wife came to him not directly, but through perfection in order to correct his miscarriage.""
	* Reference translation: ""His wife came to him not directly, but through perfection in order to correct his mistake.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a different word order than the reference translation. The reference translation places the verb ""came"" before the object ""wife"", while the machine translation places it after the object ""wife"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall structure and clarity of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and word order. While the differences are minor, they can affect the overall quality and accuracy of the translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""He can be regarded as a symbol of Tallinn"" (MT) vs. ""He can be regarded as a symbol of Tallinn, and poems and songs have been created about him"" (Ref)
	* The machine translation uses the phrase ""regarded as"" instead of ""and poems and songs have been created about him"" which is more literal and accurate.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Tallinna sümboliks"" (MT) vs. ""Tallinn, and poems and songs have been created about him"" (Ref)
	* The machine translation uses the genitive case incorrectly, it should be ""Tallinn's symbol"" instead of ""Tallinna sümboliks"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""pidada"" (MT) vs. ""created"" (Ref)
	* The machine translation uses the word ""pidada"" which means ""to be regarded as"" in Estonian, while the reference translation uses the word ""created"" which is more accurate in this context.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Tallinna sümboliks ning temast on loodud luuletusi ja laule"" (MT) vs. ""He can be regarded as a symbol of Tallinn, and poems and songs have been created about him"" (Ref)
	* The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, which can make it harder to understand the meaning. In the reference translation, the word order is more logical and clear.
5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""Tallinna sümboliks"" (MT) vs. ""Tallinn, and poems and songs have been created about him"" (Ref)
	* The machine translation doesn't capture the cultural reference of ""Tallinna sümboliks"" which means ""Tallinn's symbol"" in Estonian, while the reference translation uses the correct phrase.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation uses less formal language and doesn't capture the cultural references and nuances of the original sentence. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality score than the machine translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""bottom"" to translate ""kõige alumist korrust laona,"" which is more idiomatic and natural in English. The reference translation uses ""storage"" which is a more general term that can refer to any type of storage space, whereas ""bottom floor"" is more specific and refers to the lowest level of a building.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""were generally used"" to translate ""Tavaliselt kasutati,"" which is correct. However, the reference translation uses the past tense ""was generally used"" to translate ""Tavaliselt kasutati,"" which is also correct.
3. Word order: In the machine translation, the word order is different than in the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""such buildings"" comes before ""were generally used,"" whereas in the reference translation, ""such buildings"" comes after ""were generally used."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and flow of the translation.
4. Idioms and expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""kõige alumist korrust laona"" which means ""the bottom floor"" in English. The reference translation uses a more literal translation ""storage"" which does not convey the same meaning.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the Estonian phrase, which may not be familiar to English speakers. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses a more culturally appropriate term ""storage"" which is more likely to be understood by English speakers.

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a score of 60% and the reference translation a score of 80%. The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the nuance and cultural context that the reference translation provides.

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""However, it is necessary to decide what to do with her life, which she is now living near Morna, and which is to decide what to do.""
	* Reference translation: ""Are needs to decide what to do with Raim who is trying to find his way back into her life and has now moved to live near Morna.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""her life"" instead of ""Raim's life"" in the reference translation.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kippuva Raimiga"" (meaning ""Raim's life"")
	* Reference translation: ""Raim who is trying to find his way back into her life""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""kippuva"" (meaning ""her life"") instead of ""Raim"" in the reference translation.

	* Reference translation: ""Are needs to decide what to do with Raim who is trying to find his way back into her life and has now moved to live near Morna.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation separates the two clauses with a comma, while the reference translation uses a single sentence structure.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""colis Morna lähedale elama"" (meaning ""to decide what to do with Raim's life"")
	* Reference translation: ""find his way back into her life""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian idiomatic expression ""colis Morna lähedale elama"" (meaning ""to decide what to do with Raim's life"") instead of the more common English idiomatic expression ""find his way back into her life"".
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation seems to struggle with the sentence structure and word choice, resulting in a less fluent and less natural-sounding translation compared to the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation in this case. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, word choice, and sentence structure, which can make the translation sound less natural and less idiomatic.

1. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""will come back"" instead of the past tense ""came back"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""deviated"" instead of ""kõrvale kaldusime"" in the reference translation. ""Deviated"" means ""went away from a proper or expected course"" while ""kõrvale kaldusime"" means ""to come back"". This is a significant difference in meaning, as the machine translation does not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
3. Phrasing: The machine translation uses a more formal and literal translation of the sentence, while the reference translation uses a more idiomatic and natural phrasing. For example, the machine translation uses ""However, we will come back to where we deviated"" while the reference translation uses ""However, we will come back to where we came back"".
4. Fluency: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The sentence structure and word choice in the machine translation are less natural and may sound awkward or unnatural to an English speaker.

Based on these differences, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as moderate, with a score of 60-70%. While the machine translation is mostly accurate in terms of grammar and word choice, it lacks the natural phrasing and flow of the reference translation.

In contrast, the reference translation is of high quality, with a score of 80-90%. The translation is not only accurate in terms of grammar and word choice, but it also conveys the intended meaning of the original sentence in a natural and idiomatic way.

Machine Translation: ""It has in mind moral ceilings as the starting point for discipline.""

* The machine translation uses the term ""moral ceilings"" instead of ""point of origin"" to translate ""distsipliini alguspunkti"". This is a significant difference, as ""moral ceilings"" doesn't quite convey the same meaning as ""point of origin"". ""Moral ceilings"" could be interpreted as a metaphorical ceiling or limit on moral behavior, rather than the starting point of a discipline.
* The machine translation also uses the verb ""has in mind"" instead of ""references"" to translate ""alguspunkti"". This is a minor difference, but it changes the tone of the sentence slightly, as ""has in mind"" implies a more mental or cognitive process, whereas ""references"" suggests a more concrete or tangible point of origin.

Reference Translation: ""He refers to the point of origin of moral philosophy as a discipline.""

* The reference translation uses the verb ""references"" to translate ""alguspunkti"", which is a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Estonian word.
* The reference translation also uses the phrase ""point of origin of moral philosophy"" instead of ""moral ceilings"" to translate ""distsipliini alguspunkti"". This is a more accurate translation, as ""point of origin"" is a more neutral and descriptive term that doesn't carry the same connotations as ""moral ceilings"".

Overall, the machine translation makes some significant errors in this sentence, particularly in the use of the term ""moral ceilings"" and the verb ""has in mind"". The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Estonian sentence.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""It looks like a friend of fresh air compared to Platon."" (incorrect grammar)
	* Reference translation: ""It feels like a breath of fresh air compared to Plato."" (correct grammar)

The machine translation uses the wrong word order in the sentence, which can make it difficult to understand the meaning. The reference translation uses the correct word order, which makes the sentence easier to read and understand.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""friend of fresh air"" (incorrect word choice)
	* Reference translation: ""breath of fresh air"" (correct word choice)

The machine translation uses the phrase ""friend of fresh air,"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic phrase ""breath of fresh air,"" which conveys the same meaning more accurately.

3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""sõõm värsket õhku"" (incorrect idiom)
	* Reference translation: ""a breath of fresh air"" (correct idiom)

The machine translation uses the Estonian idiom ""sõõm värsket õhku,"" which doesn't have a direct translation in English. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic expression ""a breath of fresh air,"" which conveys the same meaning more accurately.

4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""Platon"" (incorrect cultural reference)
	* Reference translation: ""Plato"" (correct cultural reference)

The machine translation uses the name ""Platon,"" which is the Estonian spelling of the Greek philosopher Plato. The reference translation uses the more common and widely recognized spelling ""Plato.""

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate, idiomatic, and culturally relevant, making it a better choice for communication purposes.

Reference Translation:

* ""pisiA moment before the start of the first concert of the [ [ XXV Song FestivalXXV Song Festival""

The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are:

In the machine translation, the phrase ""just a moment before"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed after the phrase ""start of the first concert.""
2. Use of prepositions: The machine translation uses the preposition ""before"" instead of ""a moment before"" in the reference translation.
3. Use of definite article: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""group"" and ""singer,"" while the reference translation does not use the definite article.
4. Use of numerals: The machine translation uses numerals to represent the number ""25,"" while the reference translation uses words.
5. Use of verb tense: The machine translation uses the present tense for the verb ""brakes,"" while the reference translation uses the past tense for the verb ""started.""
6. Use of word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""brakes"" instead of ""started"" in the reference translation.
7. Use of idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""first concert"" in the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, preposition use, definite article use, numeral use, verb tense, and word choice. The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English.

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""segab"" instead of ""segab puhtaid"" in the second sentence, which means ""to confuse"" in English. Additionally, the word order in the machine translation is different, with ""puhtaid"" coming after ""printsiipe"" instead of before it.
2. Vocabulary:

Reference Translation: ""That is why human life or activity has some good purpose, which is the ultimate.""

Here are the differences I found between the two translations:

1. Use of ""person's"" vs. ""human life"" - The machine translation uses ""person's"" to translate ""inimese,"" while the reference translation uses ""human life."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly.
2. Use of ""objective"" vs. ""purpose"" - The machine translation uses ""objective"" to translate ""eeskärk,"" while the reference translation uses ""purpose."" This is a more significant difference, as ""objective"" can have a broader meaning than ""purpose,"" implying a more general or abstract goal.
3. Use of ""ultimate"" vs. ""ultimate"" - Both translations use ""ultimate"" to translate ""ülim,"" but the reference translation uses it twice, while the machine translation uses it only once. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the flow of the sentence slightly.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the original Estonian sentence.

Comparison:

* The machine translation does not accurately convey the same meaning as the reference translation. While the machine translation does translate the name of the company correctly, it changes the wording of the sentence to make it sound less formal and more informal.
* The reference translation provides a more formal and accurate translation of the source text, while the machine translation sacrifices accuracy for a more casual tone.

Conclusion:

Based on the analysis above, it is clear that the machine translation does not meet the quality standards for Estonian-English translation. The reference translation provides a more accurate and formal translation of the source text, which is essential for professional and academic settings.

2. Machine Translation: ""The analysis was simply the division of the term into 'parts' for Kant.""
3. Reference Translation: ""For Kant, analysis was simply the division of a concept into 'parts'.""

Comparison:

* The machine translation and reference translation both convey the same meaning, which is that Kant's analysis involved dividing a concept into parts.
* However, there are some differences in the wording and phrasing between the two translations:
	+ The machine translation uses the phrase ""division of the term into 'parts'"" while the reference translation uses ""division of a concept into 'parts'"".
	+ The machine translation uses the word ""oli"" (which means ""was"" in Estonian) while the reference translation uses ""was"".
	+ The machine translation omits the word ""For"" at the beginning of the reference translation.

Evaluation:

* The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English, as it uses more common phrasing and wording.
* The machine translation, on the other hand, is more literal and may not be as easily understandable for a native English speaker.
* The machine translation also makes one small error in omitting the word ""For"" at the beginning of the reference translation.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""A very large proportion of the assets are in the hands of the few, kuigi ametlikud seisusevahed puuduvad."" (Note: ""kuigi"" is a preposition that means ""although"" or ""even though"")
	* Reference translation: ""A very large proportion of the assets are in the hands of the few rich , even though the official differences of status are absent.""

The machine translation uses the preposition ""kuigi"" to indicate a contrast between the two clauses, which is a common feature of Estonian grammar. However, the reference translation uses the phrase ""even though"" to convey the same idea more clearly and naturally in English.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""osast"" (meaning ""differences"")
	* Reference translation: ""status"" (meaning ""social status"")

The machine translation uses the word ""osast"" to translate the Estonian word ""seisusevahed"", which can mean both ""differences"" and ""status"". However, in this context, it seems more appropriate to use ""status"" to convey the idea of social status, which is what the reference translation does.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""puuduvad"" (meaning ""are absent"")
	* Reference translation: ""are absent"" (no change)

The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""puuduvad"" to translate the English phrase ""are absent"", which is a common idiomatic expression in English. However, the reference translation simply uses the standard English phrase ""are absent"" without any changes.

4. Fluency and coherence:
	* Machine translation: The translation flows well and is easy to understand, but there are some minor errors in word choice and grammar.
	* Reference translation: The translation is very fluent and coherent, with no major errors in grammar or word choice.

Overall, the reference translation is more fluent and coherent than the machine translation, with fewer errors in grammar and word choice. However, the machine translation is still readable and understandable, and it does a good job of conveying the main idea of the original text.

In conclusion, while the machine translation is generally accurate and well-translated, there are some minor errors and inefficiencies that could be improved upon. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more polished and natural-sounding, and it provides a better example of how the text could be translated into English.

		+ The MT uses the word ""see"" which is not a direct translation of the Estonian word ""asjadevahelised"". The RT uses the term ""objects"" which is a more accurate translation of the Estonian word ""asjadevahelised"".
4. Tense consistency:
	* Machine translation: present tense ""predict"" (MT) vs. past tense ""predicted"" (RT)

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""In 1998 Buyoya announced a transitional constitution and a partnership between the government and the opposition National Assembly."" (incorrect use of ""and"" instead of ""&"")
	* Reference translation: ""In 1998 Buyoya announced a transitional constitution and a partnership between the government and the oppositional National Assembly."" (correct use of ""&"")
2. Word choice and terminology:
	* Machine translation: ""kuulutas"" (Estonian) -> ""announced"" (English)
	* Reference translation: ""kuulutas"" (Estonian) -> ""announced"" (English)
	* Machine translation: ""Buyoya"" (Estonian) -> ""Buyoya"" (English)
	* Reference translation: ""Buyoya"" (Estonian) -> ""Buyoya"" (English)
3. Punctuation:
	* Machine translation: ""In 1998 Buyoya announced a transitional constitution and a partnership between the government and the opposition National Assembly."" (incorrect punctuation)
	* Reference translation: ""In 1998 Buyoya announced a transitional constitution and a partnership between the government and the oppositional National Assembly."" (correct punctuation)
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""välja üleminekupõhiseaduse"" (Estonian) -> ""transitional constitution"" (English)
	* Reference translation: ""välja üleminekupõhiseaduse"" (Estonian) -> ""transitional constitution"" (English)

Based on the above analysis, it is clear that the machine translation has several errors and inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The machine translation uses more formal and literal translations, while the reference translation takes into account the cultural and contextual nuances of the Estonian language. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable source for Estonian-English translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""vaatlused"" (plural) is translated as ""they included"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""these observations"" (singular).
	* Reference translation: ""sisaldasid"" (present tense) is translated as ""would"" in the reference translation, which is a more formal and less common way of expressing the idea of future tense in English.
2. Tense consistency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation switches between present and past tense throughout the sentence, which can make it difficult to understand the intended meaning.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains a consistent tense throughout the sentence, which makes it easier to understand.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, which can affect the meaning. For example, "" Need vaatlused olid selles mõttes objektiivsed"" becomes ""Need vaatlused olid selles mõttes objektiivsed"" in the machine translation.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the original word order of the Estonian sentence, which is more accurate.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the Estonian sentence, such as ""olid selles mõttes objektiivsed"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation includes these idiomatic expressions, which are important for conveying the intended meaning.
5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the present perfect tense in ""annaksid praegugi suuresti sama tulemuse"", which is not necessary in English.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the simple past tense ""would produce the same result"" instead of the present perfect tense.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the Estonian sentence. The reference translation is more consistent in terms of word choice, tense consistency, word order, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further communication or translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""its Official Journal"" (singular)
	* Reference translation: ""the State Gazette"" (singular)

The machine translation uses the singular form ""Official Journal,"" while the reference translation uses the singular form ""State Gazette."" Both are correct, but the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Estonian.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""will enter into force day after its publication""
	* Reference translation: ""will enter into force a day after its publication""

The machine translation uses the present perfect tense ""will enter into force,"" while the reference translation uses the simple past tense ""will enter into force."" Both are grammatically correct, but the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Estonian.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""a day after its publication""
	* Reference translation: ""a day after its publication in the State Gazette""

The machine translation places the phrase ""a day after"" at the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation places it after the verb ""will enter into force."" The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Estonian.

4. Phraseology:
	* Machine translation: ""its Official Journal""
	* Reference translation: ""the State Gazette""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""its Official Journal,"" while the reference translation uses the phrase ""the State Gazette."" Both are correct, but the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Estonian.

5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""its Official Journal"" (no cultural reference)
	* Reference translation: ""the State Gazette"" (cultural reference to the official gazette of Estonia)

The machine translation does not include any cultural references, while the reference translation includes a cultural reference to the official gazette of Estonia, which is important for conveying the context and meaning of the sentence in Estonian.

Based on these differences, I would give the reference translation a higher quality score than the machine translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic, natural-sounding, and culturally relevant in Estonian, which is important for conveying the intended meaning and context of the sentence.

Source: Kratylos 402a) Selle tsitaadi esimest osa peetakse mitteehtsaks.

Machine Translation: Kratylos 402a) The first part of this quotation is considered non-linear.

Reference Translation: Kratylos 402a) The first part of this quote is considered non-authentic .

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""non-linear"" to translate ""mitteehtsaks"", while the reference translation uses ""non-authentic"". The term ""non-linear"" is more commonly used in English to describe something that is not linear or sequential, while ""non-authentic"" implies that something is not genuine or true to its original form.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in the translation, while the reference translation uses the past tense. This is likely due to the fact that the original quote is in the past tense.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""considered non-linear"" to translate ""mitteehtsaks"", which is a bit awkward and not a common idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses a more natural-sounding phrase, ""considered non-authentic"".
4. Accuracy: The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it uses the term ""linear"" to describe something that is not necessarily linear. In English, the term ""linear"" typically refers to something that has a straight and direct path or sequence.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more nuanced and accurate translation of the original quote, while the machine translation is more straightforward but less idiomatic.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given source:

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation uses the term ""Norwegian historic regions"" instead of ""Norra ajaloolised piirkonnad"" in the source.
* The translation of ""Norra ajaloolised piirkonnad"" as ""Norwegian historic regions"" is not accurate. ""Ajaloolised"" in Estonian means ""historic"" or ""historical"", and ""piirkonnad"" means ""regions"". So, the correct translation should be ""Historic regions of Norway"".
* The machine translation also uses the term ""Norway's historic counties"" instead of ""Norra ajaloolised maakonnad"". In Estonian, ""maakonnad"" means ""counties"", so the correct translation should be ""Historic counties of Norway"".
* The machine translation uses the term ""Norwegian urban regions"" instead of ""Norra linnapiirkonnad"". In Estonian, ""linnapiirkonnad"" means ""urban regions"", so the correct translation should be ""Urban regions of Norway"".

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation uses the term ""Norra ajaloolised piirkonnad"" which is the correct term in Estonian.
* The reference translation translates ""Norra ajaloolised maakonnad"" as ""Norway's historic counties"", which is accurate.
* The reference translation translates ""Norra linnapiirkonnad"" as ""Norwegian urban regions"", which is accurate.

Based on my analysis, the machine translation is not accurate in several places, especially when it comes to the use of Estonian terminology. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and faithful to the original Estonian text. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further translation work.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""When the Prince of Cont remained in the north"" is moved to the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed after ""Kui Conti prints jäi põhja"". This results in a different emphasis on the timing of the Prince's location.
2. Use of ""Cont"" vs. ""Conti"": The machine translation uses ""Cont"" instead of ""Conti"" to refer to the Prince. This is a minor difference, but it may affect the clarity and consistency of the translation.
3. Collapse vs. went down: The machine translation changes the meaning of the verb ""krahu"" (collapse) to ""went down"". While ""krahu"" can indeed mean ""went down"" in some contexts, it is not the most common or idiomatic translation of the word in this sentence. In the reference translation, ""krahu"" is used to convey the idea of a physical collapse or fall, which is more appropriate in this context.
4. Pidi vs. went: The machine translation changes the verb ""pidi"" (go) to ""went"" in the sentence. While both verbs can be used to indicate movement, ""pidi"" is often used in more formal or literary contexts, while ""went"" is more commonly used in informal speech.
5. Lõunasse vs. south: The machine translation changes the location of the destination in the sentence from ""lõunasse"" (south) to ""down that road"". While both phrases can be used to indicate the direction of movement, ""lõunasse"" is more specific and idiomatic in this context, as it refers to the actual geographical location of the destination.

Overall, the machine translation makes several changes to the word order, verb tenses, and vocabulary of the sentence, which can affect the clarity and accuracy of the translation. While some of these changes may be minor and not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, others can result in a less idiomatic or less clear translation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating than the reference translation.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""The overall table describes the results of the batches of the numbers couple written in the package,""
	* Reference translation: ""In the above table, the pairs if numbers in bold describe the results games.""

The machine translation uses the incorrect word ""couple"" instead of ""pairs"" in the second sentence, which is a common mistake in Estonian-English translation.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""paksus"" (package)
	* Reference translation: ""games""

The machine translation uses the word ""paksus"" which is the Estonian word for ""package"", while the reference translation uses the word ""games"" which is the correct translation of the Estonian word ""kaks"" in this context.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""tulemusi"" (results)

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""The Pope was concerned about the situation in Haiti on 9 January 2011."" (incorrect subject-verb agreement)
	* Reference translation: ""The Pope expressed concern about the situation in Haiti on 9 January 2011."" (correct subject-verb agreement)
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""muret"" (Estonian word for ""was"")
	* Reference translation: ""expressed"" (more idiomatic and natural in English)
3. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""on 9 January 2011"" (incorrect tense)
	* Reference translation: ""on 9 January 2011"" (correct tense)
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Haiti olukorra pärast"" (Estonian sentence structure)
	* Reference translation: ""The Pope expressed concern about the situation in Haiti on 9 January 2011."" (more natural and idiomatic in English)
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""olukorra"" (Estonian idiomatic expression)
	* Reference translation: ""concerned"" (more idiomatic and natural in English)

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural as the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural in English, and it correctly uses the correct grammar, word choice, tense, and word order.

Overall, the machine translation is not a reliable source for Estonian-English translations, and it's important to use high-quality reference translations to ensure accuracy and naturalness in the target language.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""sleight of cyclone""
	* Reference translation: ""maturity exams""

The machine translation uses a more creative and unconventional phrase to translate ""pealekäimisel"", which means ""when his father approached"" in Estonian. However, the reference translation uses a more literal and common phrase to translate the same sentence, which is easier to understand for a non-native speaker.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""attempted to use his father's sleight of cyclone""
	* Reference translation: ""tried to take maturity exams""

The machine translation uses a past participle form of the verb ""use"" to translate ""proovis"", which means ""he attempted"" in Estonian. However, the reference translation uses the infinitive form of the verb ""take"" to translate ""proovis"", which is more idiomatic and natural in English.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Jihping's synasium""
	* Reference translation: ""Jihlava Gymnasium""

The machine translation changes the word order of the Estonian sentence, which can make it harder to understand for a non-native speaker. The reference translation keeps the original word order, which is more natural and easier to read.

4. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""sleight of cyclone""
	* Reference translation: ""maturity exams""

As mentioned earlier, the machine translation uses a creative and unconventional phrase to translate ""pealekäimisel"", which may not be familiar to non-native speakers. The reference translation uses a more common and natural phrase to translate the same sentence.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more common and idiomatic phrases, keeps the original word order, and avoids using unconventional phrases that may be difficult to understand for non-native speakers.

Word order: The machine translation uses the word order ""President of the Estonian Assembly, Ene Ergma, was present at the visit in Elvas."" while the reference translation uses ""President of the Estonian Riigikogu, Ene Ergma, was on a visit to Elva."" The reference translation uses a more formal and traditional word order, which is more common in Estonian.
2. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""visit"" while the reference translation does not use any article. In Estonian, the definite article is usually not used before nouns that start with a vowel, as in ""visiidil"" in the source text.
3. Possessive form: The machine translation uses the possessive form ""of the Estonian Assembly"" while the reference translation uses the possessive form ""of Estonian Riigikogu"". In Estonian, the possessive form is formed differently depending on the type of noun, and in this case, ""Riigikogu"" is the possessive form used.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""was present"" while the reference translation uses ""was on a visit"". The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Estonian.
5. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include any punctuation after ""Elvas"" while the reference translation includes a period at the end of the sentence. In Estonian, punctuation is often used to separate clauses for clarity.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and follows the rules of Estonian grammar and syntax more closely. The machine translation makes some errors in word order, article usage, and word choice, which can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the prepositional phrase ""of the Union"" is placed after the verb ""set up,"" while in the reference translation, it is placed before the verb. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with the nuances of word order in different languages.
2. Use of ""kuulusid"": The machine translation uses the word ""kuulusid"" instead of ""set up"" in the reference translation. This is likely a mistake, as ""kuulusid"" is not a word in English. In this case, the machine translation should have used the word ""established"" or ""set up"" instead.
3. Use of ""esindajad"": The machine translation uses the word ""esindajad"" instead of ""representatives"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. In this case, the machine translation is closer to the original Estonian text, as ""esindajad"" means ""representatives"" in Estonian.
4. Use of ""Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain"": The machine translation uses commas to separate the countries, while the reference translation uses a conjunction ""and"" to connect the countries. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall readability of the sentence. In this case, both translations are correct, but the reference translation is more idiomatic in English.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in this case. The machine translation makes several mistakes, including changing the word order, using a non-existent word, and using a different conjunction to connect the countries. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""eriti raske"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""larger work"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the word ""eriti raske,"" which means ""badly written"" in Estonian. However, the reference translation uses the word ""larger work"" to convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.

3. Idiomatic expressions:

1. Word order: The machine translation often changes the word order in the sentence, which can affect the meaning. For example, in the sentence ""The translates and commented Urmas Premäe, delivered Enn Tarvel,"" the machine translation changes the word order to ""Urmas Premäe, delivered and translated Enn Tarvel."" This can make the sentence sound less natural and less clear.
2. Grammar: The machine translation often makes grammatical errors, such as using the wrong verb tense or subject-verb agreement. For example, in the sentence ""The translates and commented Urmas Premäe, delivered Enn Tarvel,"" the machine translation changes the verb tense to ""The translated and commented Urmas Premäe, delivered Enn Tarvel,"" which is incorrect.
3. Vocabulary: The machine translation often uses less formal or less common vocabulary than the reference translation. For example, in the sentence ""The translates and commented Urmas Premäe, delivered Enn Tarvel,"" the machine translation uses the word ""translates"" instead of ""translated,"" which is more formal and less common in everyday language.
4. Idioms and expressions: The machine translation often fails to capture the nuances of idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms. For example, in the sentence ""The translates and commented Urmas Premäe, delivered Enn Tarvel,"" the machine translation changes the idiomatic expression ""translates and commented"" to ""translated and commented,"" which sounds less natural.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation may not capture cultural references or allusions that are specific to the Estonian language. For example, in the sentence ""The translates and commented Urmas Premäe, delivered Enn Tarvel,"" the machine translation may not understand the cultural reference to the Estonian poet Urmas Premäe, which is a well-known figure in Estonian literature.
6. Tone and style: The machine translation may not capture the tone and style of the original text, which can affect the overall quality of the translation. For example, in the sentence ""The translates and commented Urmas Premäe, delivered Enn Tarvel,"" the machine translation may sound more formal and less conversational than the reference translation, which has a more relaxed tone.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""one-size-fits-all bases"" (Reference: ""single-deck vessels"")
		+ The machine translation uses the phrase ""one-size-fits-all,"" which is not a common term in English. In this context, it would be more accurate to use ""single-deck vessels,"" which is a more precise term for the type of ship being referred to.
2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""had consisted"" (Reference: ""had consisted"")
		+ Both the machine translation and the reference translation use the past tense, but the machine translation uses the past participle form of the verb ""consist,"" which is not necessary in this context. The reference translation uses the simple past tense form, which is more common and natural in English.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""with relatively easy cannons"" (Reference: ""with relatively light cannons"")
		+ The machine translation uses the phrase ""with relatively easy cannons,"" which is not a common way to describe the type of weapons used on ships. In this context, it would be more accurate to use ""with relatively light cannons,"" which is a more precise term for the type of weapons being referred to.
4. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""kahuritega"" (Reference: ""suhteliselt kergete"")
		+ The machine translation uses the word ""kahuritega,"" which is not a word in English. In this context, it would be more accurate to use ""suhteliselt kergete,"" which is a more natural and common way to express the idea of ""until the beginning of the 17th century.""

Overall, the machine translation makes several errors in word choice, tense, word order, and grammar, which can affect the accuracy and naturalness of the translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more precise and natural in its use of language, which makes it a better representation of the original Estonian text.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""approximately"" in both the source and reference translations, which is a correct and appropriate word choice.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense in both the source and reference translations, which is correct. However, the reference translation uses a more formal and academic tone, which may not be suitable for all contexts.
3. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses the word ""overcrowded"" to translate the Estonian word ""umbes"", which is a good choice. However, the reference translation uses the word ""overcrowded prisons"" instead of ""prisons"", which may not be as clear and concise as the machine translation.
4. Sentence structure: The machine translation and reference translation have the same sentence structure, which is clear and easy to understand.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""amnesty period"".
6. Cultural references: The machine translation does not use any cultural references, while the reference translation uses the term ""amnesty period"", which is a cultural reference that may not be familiar to all readers.
7. Accuracy: The machine translation is generally accurate, but the reference translation is more precise in its word choice and sentence structure.

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a score of 70% and the reference translation a score of 80%. The machine translation is generally accurate, but it could benefit from more precise word choice and sentence structure. The reference translation is more formal and academic, but it is more precise in its word choice and sentence structure.

The machine translation uses the word ""reegli"" which is not a commonly used term in English. The reference translation uses the term ""rule utilitarianism"" which is a more common and accurate term in English.

3. Idiomatic expressions:

Reference Translation: ""It was precisely the Estonian mainland that was hardest hit by the war.""

* The reference translation uses the correct term ""Eesti mandriosa"" instead of ""Estonian mainland.""
* The sentence structure is the same as in the machine translation.

Overall, the machine translation makes two significant errors in this sentence:

1. It uses the incorrect term ""Estonian mainland"" instead of ""Eesti mandriosa.""
2. It places the adjective ""hardest hit"" after the noun ""war"" instead of before it.

In comparison, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic, using the correct term ""Eesti mandriosa"" and placing the adjective ""hardest hit"" before the noun ""war."" Based on these differences, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

	* Machine translation: ""toimusidki"" (battles) is translated as ""fierce battles"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses the more literal translation ""battles"".
	* Machine translation: ""ägedad"" (but) is translated as ""particularly"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""but"".
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout, while the reference translation uses the past tense to indicate that the events described took place in the past.
	* Machine translation: The machine translation omits the article ""the"" before ""Nys"", while the reference translation includes it.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not translate the idiomatic expression ""kuid Eesti kaitse pidas vastu"" (but Estonia's protection resisted) correctly, as ""pidas vastu"" is not a commonly used phrase in English. The reference translation uses a more literal translation ""defences held"".
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses a more simple sentence structure than the reference translation, which includes more complex sentence structures.
5. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation often changes the word order in the sentence, such as in ""detsembris toimusidki ägedad lahingud"" (In December there were fierce battles), where the word order is reversed in the machine translation.
6. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation may not capture cultural references or nuances that are specific to Estonian or English language usage. For example, the reference translation includes the name ""Narva"", which is a specific location in Estonia, while the machine translation does not.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have different levels of quality in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, sentence structure, and cultural references. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic, while the machine translation may struggle to capture the nuances of the original text.

4. Capitalization: The machine translation capitalizes the word ""Euroopa"" in ""Euroopa Liidu,"" while the reference translation does not capitalize it.
5. Translation of ""kahepäevane"": The machine translation translates ""kahepäevane"" as ""informal meeting,"" while the reference translation translates it as ""two days of informal meeting.""

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""In 2006 he was elected for a second term of office."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""In 2006 he was elected for a second term of office."" (correct)

The machine translation makes a grammatical error by using the wrong verb tense. The sentence should read ""In 2006 he was elected for a second term of office"" to maintain the correct tense consistency.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Ametisse"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""a second term of office"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the word ""ametisse,"" which is not a correct Estonian word. The correct word for ""second term of office"" in Estonian is ""a second term of office.""

3. Phrasing:
	* Machine translation: ""Aastal 2006 valiti ta ametisse teiseks ametiajaks."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""In 2006 he was elected for a second term of office."" (correct)

The machine translation uses a different phrasing than the reference translation. The machine translation separates the sentence into two clauses, while the reference translation keeps the sentence as a single, complete sentence.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""valiti"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""was elected"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the Estonian verb ""valiti,"" which means ""to elect,"" but it is not the most idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more common English phrase ""was elected.""

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a score of 2 out of 5 for quality.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""President of the United States"" is placed at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed before the verb ""congratulated."" This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with word order and sentence structure.
2. Phraseology: The machine translation uses the phrase ""Balti harta allkirjastamise kümnendal aastapäeval"" while the reference translation uses ""Baltic Charter."" This is a difference in phraseology, as ""Balti harta"" is not a commonly used term in English, and ""Baltic Charter"" is the more widely recognized term.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the singular form of the verb ""congratulated"" (kümnendal) while the reference translation uses the plural form (congratulated). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation.
4. Spelling: The machine translation spells ""Bush"" with a single ""s"" (Bushs), while the reference translation spells it with two ""s""s (Bushes). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall readability of the translation.
5. Fluency: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The machine translation uses more words and phrases than necessary to convey the same meaning, which can make it sound less natural and less fluent.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation. While it gets the basic meaning of the sentence across, it makes several errors in word order, phraseology, grammar, and spelling. As a result, the reference translation is more reliable and better represents the original Estonian text.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kuulati"" (intercepted) is not a common word in English, and ""were asked"" is a more natural way to express the idea.
	* Reference translation: ""were questioned"" is a more accurate translation of ""kuulati"" in this context.
2. Tense consistency:
	* Machine translation: The past tense ""had been dealt with"" is inconsistent with the present tense ""were intercepted"" and ""were asked"". It would be better to use the same tense throughout the sentence.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the same tense throughout the sentence, which is more consistent and easier to read.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The word order in the machine translation is different from the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""surviving crew members"" comes before ""were intercepted"", while in the reference translation, it comes after.
	* Reference translation: The word order in the reference translation is more natural and logical, with the subject ""surviving crew members"" coming after the action ""were intercepted"".
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""handle the ship"" in the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""handle the ship"" to convey the idea of the crew's actions during the accident, which is more natural and accurate.
5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the wrong verb form in the sentence ""how the ship had been dealt with"". The correct verb form is ""how the ship was dealt with"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the correct verb form ""was dealt with"" in this sentence.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Estonian sentence better, including the idiomatic expressions and the correct verb forms.

	* Reference translation: ""fait accompli"" is translated as ""kindlaks tehtud fakti"" in the reference translation, which is a more accurate translation of the original Estonian phrase
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the present tense (""can be detected"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""can be detected with observations"")
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the past tense to indicate that the concept of an established fact has already been detected through observations, while the machine translation does not convey this nuance
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""with observations"" in the reference translation, which is a common way to express the idea of detecting something through careful examination or investigation
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""with observations"" to convey the idea of detecting an established fact through careful examination or investigation
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, placing ""perhaps"" at the beginning of the sentence instead of after the verb ""detected""
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the original word order in the sentence, with ""perhaps"" appearing after the verb ""detected""
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation, with some phrases feeling awkward or unnatural
	* Reference translation: The reference translation flows more smoothly and naturally, with a more even rhythm and better sentence structure

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation.

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the word order is different than in the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""Later than"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed after the verb ""was arrested"".
2. Tense consistency: The machine translation changes the tense of the verb ""arrested"" from past tense to present tense, while the reference translation maintains the past tense consistency. In the machine translation, the verb ""arrested"" is in the present tense, while in the reference translation, it is in the past tense.
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""arreteeriti"" instead of ""arreteerimist"" in the source text. ""Arreteeriti"" is the Estonian word for ""arrested"", while ""arreteerimist"" is the word for ""arrest"".
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence is structured as a simple sentence, while in the reference translation, it is structured as a compound sentence with a subordinate clause.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""kinnitatud"" in the source text, which means ""confirmed"" in Estonian.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the original Estonian sentence. The machine translation makes several errors in word choice, tense consistency, and grammatical structure, which can lead to a loss of meaning and clarity in the translation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.

	* Reference translation: ""The idea of the Russian empire as the 'third Rome' remained alive until the 1917 revolutions.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""kui"" (as) instead of ""as"" in the reference translation. Additionally, the machine translation puts the adjective ""third Rome"" in quotes, while the reference translation does not.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""idee püsis elus"" (idea remained alive)

	* The machine translation uses a different word order than the reference translation, which can make the sentence sound less natural. In the reference translation, the word ""authority"" is placed after ""Griffin"" to make the sentence flow better.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""planeerimisdirektorina"" (MT) vs. ""planning director"" (Reference)
	* The machine translation uses a more literal translation of the Estonian word ""planeerimisdirektorina"", which doesn't quite convey the same meaning as the reference translation's ""planning director"".
5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""oli õõnestatud"" (MT) vs. ""had been undermined"" (Reference)
	* The machine translation uses the present tense ""oli"" instead of the past tense ""had been"" in the reference translation. This can make the sentence sound less natural and accurate.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more specific terms, maintains tense consistency, and uses a more natural word order. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses more literal translations and doesn't quite capture the nuances of the original Estonian sentence.

	* Machine translation: ""It turned out that the patent did not even exist because the Commissioner responsible had forgotten to pay for the patent.""
	* Reference translation: ""It turned out that the patent was not even valid because the commissioner responsible had forgotten to pay for the patent.""

The machine translation uses the present tense ""did not even exist"" instead of the past tense ""was not even valid"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

2. Word choice and terminology:
	* Machine translation: ""unustanud patendi"" (forgotten patent)
	* Reference translation: ""maksta"" (patent)

The machine translation uses the word ""unustanud"" (forgotten) to translate ""unustanud patendi"", which is a more formal and technical term in Estonian. The reference translation uses the simpler term ""maksta"" (patent) to translate the same term.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""tegelenud volinik"" (forgotten patent)
	* Reference translation: ""valid patent""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""tegelenud volinik"" (forgotten patent) to translate ""tegelenud volinik oli unustanud patendi"", which is an idiomatic expression in Estonian. The reference translation uses the more straightforward term ""valid patent"" to translate the same term.

4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""Commissioner responsible""
	* Reference translation: ""commissioner responsible""

The machine translation uses the term ""Commissioner responsible"" without any modification, while the reference translation uses the term ""commissioner responsible"" with a capital ""C"". This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall meaning of the sentence in certain contexts.

5. Fluency and naturalness:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation sounds a bit stilted and unnatural, with a few awkward phrasings.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation sounds more fluent and natural, with a better flow of language.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The machine translation makes a few minor errors in grammar and word choice, and the phrasing can be a bit awkward in some places. However, the reference translation is generally more fluent and natural-sounding, with better idiomatic expressions and cultural references.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Kontsert oli triumf"" (nominal phrase) vs. Reference translation: ""The concert was a triumph"" (verb phrase)
	* Machine translation: ""Mahleri biograaf Robert Carri hinnangul koguni"" (nominal phrase) vs. Reference translation: ""Mahler's biographer Robert Carr"" (nominal phrase)
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""kahtlusteta"" (verb) vs. Reference translation: ""triumph"" (noun)
	* Machine translation: ""suurim"" (adjective) vs. Reference translation: ""greatest"" (adjective)
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""ole"" (verb) vs. Reference translation: ""was"" (verb)
	* Machine translation: ""hinnangul"" (verb) vs. Reference translation: ""even"" (conjunction)
4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: ""oli"" (verb) vs. Reference translation: ""was a"" (verb phrase)
	* Machine translation: ""kahtlusteta"" (verb) vs. Reference translation: ""triumph"" (noun)

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation and the reference translation have different levels of quality. The machine translation seems to have more errors and inaccuracies, particularly in the grammar and vocabulary areas. For example, the use of ""kahtlusteta"" instead of ""triumph"" as a noun, and ""hinnangul"" instead of ""even"" as a conjunction, are not idiomatic in English. Additionally, the machine translation uses more simple verb forms, such as ""ole"" and ""oli,"" which are not as nuanced as the verb phrases used in the reference translation.

Overall, while the machine translation is understandable, it is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation: ""The theories of natural choice were devised there by Darwin.""

* The sentence is grammatically correct, but it lacks clarity and accuracy in conveying the intended meaning.
* The phrase ""theories of natural choice"" is not a common or accurate term in English, and it is not clear what it refers to.
* The word ""there"" is used twice in the sentence, which can make it confusing.
* The phrase ""devised there by Darwin"" is awkward and could be rephrased for better clarity.

Reference Translation: ""Walking there, Darwin devised his theory of natural selection.""

* This translation is more accurate and clear in conveying the intended meaning of the original Estonian sentence.
* The phrase ""walking there"" is a more natural and idiomatic way to express the idea of Darwin developing his theory while traveling.
* The term ""natural selection"" is a more common and accurate term in English to refer to the concept Darwin developed.
* The sentence flows better and is easier to understand than the machine translation.

Based on these differences, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, clear, and natural-sounding, while the machine translation has several errors and awkward phrasing that can make it difficult to understand.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""Five Syrians were arrested"" comes before the phrase ""in Lebanon,"" whereas in the reference translation, the phrase ""in Lebanon"" comes first. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with the nuances of word order in different languages.
2. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""explosives,"" while the reference translation does not. In Estonian, the definite article is not used before nouns that end in -ik, which is the case with ""explosives"" in this sentence.
3. Tense agreement: The machine translation uses the present tense ""are"" to describe the arrested individuals, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""were"" to describe the arrested individuals. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with tense agreement.
4. Plural nouns: The machine translation uses the plural form ""quantities"" to describe the explosives found, while the reference translation uses the singular form ""quantity."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""suures"" (large) to describe the explosives, while the reference translation uses the word ""suures koguses"" (large quantities). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word order, article usage, tense agreement, and word choice. While the machine translation is generally understandable, it is not as accurate or nuanced as the reference translation. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the primary source for Estonian-English translation.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""The economic blockade imposed on the enemies also cost the country a great deal."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""The economic blockade imposed on the enemies also cost the country a great deal."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong word order in the sentence, which can make it difficult to understand the meaning. The reference translation maintains the correct word order, which makes the sentence easier to read and understand.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""maksma"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""enemies"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""maksma,"" which means ""money,"" instead of the correct English word ""enemies."" This mistake can change the meaning of the sentence entirely.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kehtestatud majanduslikud blokaadid"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""economic blockade"" (correct)

The machine translation uses a phrase that is not commonly used in English, ""kehtestatud majanduslikud blokaadid."" In English, the phrase ""economic blockade"" is more commonly used to describe a situation where a country or group of countries imposes economic sanctions on another country or group of countries.

4. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""palju"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""a great deal"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""palju,"" which means ""much,"" instead of the more common English phrase ""a great deal."" This can make the sentence sound less natural and less idiomatic in English.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation maintains the correct word order, uses the correct vocabulary, and captures the idiomatic expressions of the original sentence more effectively.

In the machine translation, the phrase ""After five days of confrontation"" is moved to the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed after the verb ""kestnud"". This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machines often struggle to maintain the same word order as the source language.
2. Article usage: The machine translation omits the definite article ""the"" before ""defence forces"" and ""police"", while the reference translation includes it. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Tense consistency: The machine translation changes the tense of the sentence compared to the reference translation.

	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the correct grammar and syntax of the Estonian sentence, with ""Lint straight into the White House"" being the correct translation.
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the word ""party driers"" instead of ""party veterans"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the correct word ""veterans"" to translate the Estonian word ""veterane"" (lit. ""veterans"").
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not translate the Estonian idiom ""paar parteiveterani"" (lit. ""a couple of party veterans"") correctly. In English, this phrase would be more idiomatic as ""a few party veterans.""
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the idiomatic expression ""paar parteiveterani"" in the translation, which is more natural and accurate.
4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not convey the same tone and style as the reference translation. The reference translation maintains a more formal and professional tone, while the machine translation sounds more informal and conversational.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. While the machine translation is a good starting point, it is important to review and edit the translation to ensure that it is accurate and meets the desired level of quality.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source Text: Säärane saamise süüvimine endasse on meil nt elu puhul.
Machine Translation: We have, for example, the culpability of ending up as such in life.
Reference Translation: We have such self-contemplation of becoming, for example, in the case of life.

Difference 1: Word Choice (Culpability vs. Self-Contemplation)

The machine translation uses the word ""culpability,"" which is a legal term that refers to the state of being responsible for an action or event. However, in this context, the reference translation uses the phrase ""self-contemplation of becoming,"" which is a more appropriate term to convey the idea of reflecting on one's own existence or future.

Difference 2: Tense Agreement

The machine translation uses the present tense (""ending up as such in life"") to match the source text, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""became"") to indicate that the self-contemplation is a past event.

Difference 3: Word Order

The machine translation rearranges the words in the source text to create a more literal translation. In the source text, the phrase ""on meil nt elu puhul"" means ""in the case of life,"" but the machine translation places ""in life"" at the end of the sentence.

Difference 4: Idiomatic Expressions

The reference translation uses an idiomatic expression (""in the case of life"") to convey the idea of considering one's own existence or future. The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions and instead relies on literal translations.

Difference 5: Grammar

The machine translation uses the verb ""ending up"" in the active voice, while the reference translation uses the passive voice (""became"") to convey a more neutral tone.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more appropriate language and grammar to convey the intended meaning of the source text, while the machine translation relies on literal translations and word choices that don't always match the context.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""This act was also thrown out during the NSV, and the critics and censors at that time did not find that the content of the work could be anti-moral.""
	* Reference translation: ""This work was also published during the USSR period , and the critics and censors at that time did not find that the content of the work could be anti-moral.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""act was also thrown out"" which is not grammatically correct in English. The reference translation uses the phrase ""work was also published"" which is more accurate.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""moraalinormide vastane""
	* Reference translation: ""anti-moral""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""moraalinormide"" which means ""moral norms"" in English. The reference translation uses the single word ""anti-moral"" which is more common and widely understood in English.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""et teose sisu võiks olla moraalinormide vastane""
	* Reference translation: ""and the content of the work could be anti-moral""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian idiomatic expression ""teose sisu võiks olla"" which means ""the content of the work could be"" in English. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic expression ""and the content of the work could be anti-moral"" which is more natural and widely understood in English.
4. Fluency and naturalness:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation seems to struggle with the sentence structure and word choice, resulting in a less fluent and less natural translation compared to the reference translation.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate, natural, and fluent compared to the machine translation. The reference translation uses more common and widely understood English phrases and vocabulary, and the sentence structure is more natural and easier to follow. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses some Estonian phrases and word choices that may be less familiar to English speakers, and the sentence structure is less natural and more awkward.

	* Reference translation: ""liikmesriikide assamblee"" (Estonian) -> ""the Assembly of the Member States of the International Criminal Court"" (English)
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Urmas Paet"" (Estonian) -> ""Foreign Minister Urmas Paet"" (English)
	* Reference translation: ""Urmas Paet"" (Estonian) -> ""Foreign Minister Urmas Paet"" (English)
5. Spelling and punctuation:
	* Machine translation: ""The Hague"" (English) -> ""The Hague"" (English)
	* Reference translation: ""The Hague"" (English) -> ""The Hague"" (English)

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation are similar in terms of word choice and grammar, but there are some differences in phrase structure and idiomatic expressions. The machine translation uses more formal and literal translations, while the reference translation uses more idiomatic and natural-sounding expressions.

Based on this analysis, I would give the machine translation a score of 60% and the reference translation a score of 80%. The machine translation is generally accurate, but it could benefit from more natural-sounding phrasing and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more polished and natural-sounding, but it may not be as accurate in terms of word choice and grammar.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Grammar and syntax:
The machine translation and reference translation have the same grammatical structure. Both sentences are in the present tense and use the same verb forms (e.g., ""are just as typical"").
2. Vocabulary:
The machine translation uses the word ""typical"" to convey the idea of something being common or usual, while the reference translation uses the word ""typical"" to indicate that something is characteristic of a particular group or category (in this case, the Heraclitan world).
3. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation uses the phrase ""just as typical"" to convey the idea of something being equally common or usual, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""of the Heraclitan world"" to provide additional context and clarify the meaning of the sentence.
4. Word choice:
The machine translation uses the word ""mobility"" to translate the Estonian word ""liikuvus"", which refers to the quality of being in constant motion or change. The reference translation uses the word ""eternal mobility"" to convey the idea of something that is constantly changing and yet remains the same.
5. Cultural references:
The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the original Estonian sentence, which is likely to be familiar to readers with a background in Estonian culture. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides additional context and cultural nuance by mentioning the Heraclitan world, which is a philosophical concept that may be less familiar to non-Estonian speakers.
6. Fluency and naturalness:
The machine translation sounds less natural and less fluent than the reference translation. The phrase ""just as typical"" sounds a bit awkward in English, and the use of the word ""mobility"" may not be the most natural choice to translate the Estonian word ""liikuvus"".

Based on these analyses, I would give the machine translation a lower rating than the reference translation. While the machine translation captures some of the basic meaning of the original sentence, it lacks the cultural context and nuance that the reference translation provides. Additionally, the machine translation sounds less natural and less fluent than the reference translation.

Machine Translation:

* In the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi, the opposition political movement was murdered in Kenya.

Reference Translation:

* In the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi, the leader of the opposition political movement ""Tongue"" was murdered.

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""movement"" instead of ""movement 'Tongue'"".
2. Noun agreement: In the machine translation, the noun ""movement"" does not agree with the gender of the pronoun ""its"" in the phrase ""its murdered"". In the reference translation, the noun ""movement"" is in the same gender as the pronoun ""its"".
3. Punctuation: The machine translation lacks punctuation after the phrase ""Tbilisi, the opposition political movement was murdered in Kenya."" This makes the sentence harder to read and understand.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""was murdered"" instead of the past tense ""was murdered"" in the reference translation.
5. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""Tbilisi"" before ""the opposition political movement"" instead of after it.
6. Accuracy: The machine translation incorrectly identifies the location of the murder, stating that it occurred in Kenya instead of Tbilisi.

Overall, the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation due to the errors in word choice, noun agreement, punctuation, grammar, and accuracy.

1. Word choice and grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""For all cartels"" should be ""For all carpets"" (the correct word in Estonian is ""kogu"" instead of ""cartels"").
	* Machine translation: ""three cracks of Tallinn"" should be ""three coats of arms of Tallinn"" (the correct phrase in Estonian is ""Tallinna vaipa"" instead of ""cracks"").
	* Machine translation: ""with a shock in 1547"" should be ""with the year of weaving, 1547"" (the correct phrase in Estonian is ""kohal on kudumise aasta 1547"" instead of ""shock"").
2. Phrase structure:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure is different in the machine translation, with the prepositional phrase ""as a subscriber"" added at the beginning of the sentence. In the reference translation, the sentence structure is more straightforward, with the prepositional phrase ""with the year of weaving"" added after the verb ""have been built"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The phrase ""tellija tunnusena"" is not a common or idiomatic expression in Estonian, and it doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. In the reference translation, the phrase ""kogu vaipa"" is used, which is a more common and idiomatic way to refer to a carpet.
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""kogu vaipa"" as ""for all cartels"", which is not the correct translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, phrase structure, and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Estonian, and it better conveys the meaning of the original sentence.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""innumeracy"" (MT) vs. ""neural computational invariance"" (Reference)
		+ In the machine translation, the word ""innumeracy"" is used, which is a term that refers to a lack of understanding of mathematical concepts. However, the reference translation uses the term ""neural computational invariance,"" which is a more technical and specific term that refers to the idea that certain neural structures are invariant across different languages.
2. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""does not require"" (MT) vs. ""does not require the structures"" (Reference)
		+ In the machine translation, the sentence is structured as ""does not require X,"" which is a more general statement. However, in the reference translation, the sentence is structured as ""does not require the structures,"" which is a more specific and accurate statement.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""vajalike struktuuride"" (MT) vs. ""neural computational invariance"" (Reference)
		+ In the machine translation, the phrase ""vajalike struktuuride"" is used, which is an Estonian phrase that means ""structures required for acquiring language."" However, the reference translation uses the term ""neural computational invariance,"" which is a more technical and specific term that refers to the idea that certain neural structures are invariant across different languages.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""liraliseeritust ajus"" (MT) vs. ""acquiring language"" (Reference)

5. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone and style of the machine translation are less formal and more conversational than the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word choice, grammar and syntax, idiomatic expressions, and tone and style. While the machine translation may be more understandable for a general audience, the reference translation is more accurate and technical in its language.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation uses a more simplified word order compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the verb ""commemorated"" is placed at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed earlier in the sentence.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense consistently throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense for the verb ""commemorated"" and the present tense for ""50th anniversary.""
3. Phrase structure: The machine translation breaks up the sentence into smaller phrases, while the reference translation keeps the sentence as a single, longer phrase. For example, the machine translation separates ""the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution"" into two phrases, while the reference translation keeps it as one phrase.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""möödumist"" instead of ""revolutionist."" While both words can be translated as ""revolutionary,"" ""möödumist"" is a more formal and literary term, while ""revolutionist"" is more commonly used in everyday language.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the accusative case for the noun ""möödumist,"" while the reference translation uses the nominative case.
6. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""Ungari revolutsioonist.""

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The machine translation uses simpler language and word order, and does not capture the nuances of the original sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses more complex language and idiomatic expressions to convey the meaning of the original sentence more accurately.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""fix"" instead of ""fix his image"" in the reference translation. ""Fix"" is a more general term that can refer to any kind of adjustment or modification, whereas ""fix his image"" is a more specific term that implies a deliberate effort to create or maintain a particular image or reputation.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are"") to describe the subject's state, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was""). This difference in tense can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the present tense implies that the subject's state is ongoing or continuous, while the past tense implies that the subject's state has already occurred.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, placing the verb ""set"" before the subject ""limits."" In the reference translation, the word order is more typical, with the subject ""practical life"" appearing before the verb ""set.""
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""as an active creature"" instead of the more idiomatic ""as an active person."" The phrase ""active creature"" is less common in English and may not be immediately understandable to native speakers.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the plural form of the verb ""set"" (""set the limits"") instead of the singular form (""set the limit""). This difference in grammar can affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the plural form implies that multiple limits are being set, while the singular form implies that only one limit is being set.

Overall, the machine translation contains several errors that can affect the accuracy and readability of the translation.

The machine translation uses the word ""mäeahelik"" to translate ""Serra da Estrela"", which is not a common term in English. The reference translation uses the more standard term ""mountain range"".

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""kus aasta sademete hulk on tihti üle 2500 mm""

The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, which can make it harder to understand the meaning. The reference translation keeps the original word order to make the sentence more clear and natural-sounding.

Overall, the machine translation has several errors that make it less clear and less natural-sounding than the reference translation. The reference translation uses more standard English grammar and word choice, and conveys the meaning more clearly.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""images found close to fossils""
	* Reference translation: ""snail shells found close to the fossils""

The machine translation uses the word ""images"" instead of ""snail shells"". This is a common mistake in machine translation, as it can't always understand the context and nuances of the source language.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""proved this""
	* Reference translation: ""proven by the snail shells""

The machine translation uses the present tense ""proved"" instead of the past tense ""proven"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""lähedal leitud""
	* Reference translation: ""found close to""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""lähedal leitud"" which is not a common idiomatic expression in English. A more idiomatic way to translate this phrase would be ""found close to"".

4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""The images found close to fossils proved this.""
	* Reference translation: ""This was proven by the snail shells found close to the fossils.""

The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, which can affect the meaning. In the reference translation, the word order is more natural and clear.

5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""fossils""
	* Reference translation: ""fossilized remains""

The machine translation uses the term ""fossils"" which is a more general term that can refer to any type of fossilized remains. The reference translation uses the term ""fossilized remains"" which is a more specific term that refers to the remains of organisms that have been fossilized.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more natural and idiomatic translation of the Estonian sentence, while the machine translation makes several errors in word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""Kabul, the Afghan capital"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed at the end.
2. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""Afghan capital"" in the source sentence, while the reference translation does not use any article.
3. Gender agreement: The machine translation uses the masculine gender for the noun ""personnel"" in the source sentence, while the reference translation uses the neuter gender.
4. Tense agreement: The machine translation uses the past tense ""attacked"" in the source sentence, while the reference translation uses the present tense ""attack"".
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""ripped"" instead of ""dressed up"" in the source sentence, which is a different word choice than the reference translation.
6. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a different phrase structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""armed personnel who were ripped up as doctors"" is separated by a comma, while in the reference translation, it is combined into a single phrase ""armed personnel dressed up as doctors"".
7. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""near the US embassy"" in the source sentence, while the reference translation does.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation has made some errors in word choice, tense agreement, and phrase structure. The reference translation, on the other hand, has a more accurate and natural-sounding translation. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""The prize to the defenders of the line was so great that it did not even talk about proper intelligence patrols.""
	* Reference translation: ""The respect for the defenders of the line was so great that it even prevented proper reconnaissance with intelligence patrols.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb ""talk"" instead of ""reconnaissance"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""oli nii suur"" (great)
	* Reference translation: ""respect""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""suur"" (great) instead of ""respect"". This is a more literal translation of the Estonian word, but it doesn't convey the same nuance as the reference translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""juletud teha"" (did not even)
	* Reference translation: ""even prevented""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""juletud teha"" (did not even) which is not a common idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more idiomatic phrase ""even prevented"".
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The sentence is structured as a simple statement: ""The prize to the defenders of the line was so great that it did not even talk about proper intelligence patrols.""
	* Reference translation: The sentence is structured as a complex sentence with a subordinate clause: ""The respect for the defenders of the line was so great that it even prevented proper reconnaissance with intelligence patrols.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure, which can make the sentence sound less complex and less nuanced.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation conveys the same meaning as the source text more clearly and with more precision.

	* Machine translation: ""It is only by ignoring the imperatives of moral law that we cannot choose freely."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""It is only the ignoring of the imperatives of moral law that we cannot choose freely."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong word order in the subordinate clause, which results in an awkward and unnatural sentence structure. The reference translation correctly places the word ""of"" before the verb ""ignoring"" to maintain the proper word order.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""moraaliseaduse"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""moral law"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""moraaliseaduse,"" which means ""moral principles."" However, in this context, the more appropriate term would be ""moral law,"" which is the correct translation of the Estonian word ""moraal.""

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""me ei saa vabalt valida"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""we cannot choose freely"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""me ei saa vabalt valida,"" which means ""I cannot choose freely."" However, in this context, the more appropriate phrase would be ""we cannot choose freely,"" which is the correct translation of the Estonian phrase ""me ei saa valida.""

4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone and style of the machine translation are awkward and stilted, while the reference translation is more natural and fluid.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation.

1. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, moving ""Alma worry about Mare"" to the end of the sentence. In the reference translation, the word order is maintained, with ""Allan ja Alma muretsevad Mare pärast"" followed by ""kuid saavad üllatuse osalisteks"".
2. Tense: The machine translation changes the tense of the sentence, using the present tense (""I will begin"") instead of the past tense (""Allan ja Alma muretsevad"") in the reference translation.
3. Modality: The machine translation changes the modal verb ""saavad"" to ""I will be surprised"", which is a more casual and less formal way of expressing the idea. In the reference translation, the modal verb ""saavad"" is used in the past tense to indicate that the surprise happened in the past.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""surprised"" instead of ""üllatuse osalisteks"", which is the word used in the reference translation. While ""surprised"" can convey the idea of being unexpectedly delighted or amazed, ""üllatuse osalisteks"" has a more nuanced meaning of being pleasantly surprised or relieved.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""muretsevad Mare"" in the reference translation, which means ""to worry about someone"". This is a common idiomatic expression in Estonian that may not be easily translated into English.

Overall, the machine translation does not capture the nuances of the Estonian sentence as well as the reference translation does. The reference translation maintains the original word order, uses the correct tense, and captures the idiomatic expression ""muretsevad Mare"". The machine translation, on the other hand, changes the word order, uses a less formal modal verb, and uses a different word to convey the idea of surprise.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""suure eelarvepuudujäägi"" (source) vs. ""severe deficit"" (reference)
		+ The machine translation uses the word ""suure"" (meaning ""big"" or ""great"") to describe the deficit, while the reference translation uses ""severe"". While both words can be translated as ""big"" or ""great"", the reference translation uses a more formal and technical term to convey a more specific meaning.
2. Grammar:

The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as the sentence is describing a general rule and the past tense is more appropriate for expressing a generalization.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order in the second clause, placing ""not for their own qualities"" after ""their valuable qualities."" The reference translation maintains the original word order of the source text.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""their valuable qualities"" in both clauses, while the reference translation uses the more idiomatic expression ""their qualities.""
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the passive voice in the second clause, while the reference translation uses the active voice. The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as the sentence is more clearly expressing the idea that it is the person who is loved, rather than their qualities.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation in this case. The reference translation captures the nuances of the source text more effectively and is more natural-sounding in English.

523	"<s>[INST]<<SYS>>You are a helpful assistant.<</SYS>>A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""subservient"" (alkoholik)
	* Reference translation: ""subtle"" (subtiilsematele)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""subservient"" which is not a direct equivalent of the Estonian word ""subtiilsematele"". The reference translation uses the more accurate word ""subtle"" which better conveys the meaning of the Estonian word.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""issues"" (teemadele)
	* Reference translation: ""issues"" (esoteerilisematele)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the plural form of the word ""issue"" which is not necessary in this context. The reference translation uses the singular form ""issue"" with the appropriate ending to match the Estonian word.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""starts where the textbook ends"" (kus õpik lõpetab)
	* Reference translation: ""starts where the textbook ends and focuses on the most subtle and esoteric issues"" (keskendub kõige subtiilsematele ja esoteerilisematele teemadele)
	* Difference: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""starts where the textbook ends"" which is a common way to express the idea of going beyond the basics in Estonian. The reference translation uses a more accurate and idiomatic expression to convey the same meaning.
4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone and style of the machine translation are more formal and lack the nuances of the original Estonian text.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation captures the tone and style of the original Estonian text, which is more conversational and informal.

Overall, the machine translation falls short in accurately conveying the meaning and tone of the original Estonian text. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation that better captures the nuances of the original text.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Growth"" is translated as ""Majanduskasv"" in Estonian, which is correct. However, the reference translation uses ""Economic growth"" instead of just ""Growth"".
2. Tense consistency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the past tense consistently throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the present tense for ""Economic growth was"" and the past tense for ""was 0.8% in 1999"".
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation puts the verb ""was"" before the noun ""growth"", while the reference translation puts the noun ""growth"" before the verb ""was"".
4. Phrase structure:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation separates the phrase ""in 1999"" and ""in 2000"" into two separate sentences, while the reference translation combines them into one sentence with a conjunction.
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not translate the Estonian idiomatic expression ""oli 0,8% aastal 1999"" correctly, while the reference translation does.
6. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the singular form of the verb ""grow"" instead of the plural form ""grows"" in the sentence ""Growth was 0.8% in 1999"".
7. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation, with some phrases feeling awkward or unnatural.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more complex sentence structures and idiomatic expressions, which are more typical of native-level Estonian. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses simpler sentence structures and word choices that are more typical of machine translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""On the morning of 28 July"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed after the verb ""had been carried out.""
2. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""Grenaderfist"" and ""eastern camera,"" while the reference translation does not use the definite article before ""Grenaderfist.""
3. Number agreement: The machine translation agrees with the noun ""attacks"" in number, while the reference translation uses the singular form ""attack"" to match the singular verb ""had been carried out.""
4. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""had been carried out"" to describe the attacks, while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense ""only 30 were still defending"" to indicate that the defense is ongoing.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""rhygement"" instead of ""regiment,"" which is the correct spelling in Estonian.
6. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include any punctuation after the phrase ""30 were still defending,"" while the reference translation includes a period at the end of the sentence.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, article usage, number agreement, tense, and word choice. However, it's worth noting that machine translation can be a challenging task, and the quality of the translation may vary depending on the complexity of the text and the quality of the machine translation software used.

		+ The machine translation uses the phrase ""do not have"" instead of ""do not have wisdom in themselves"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. Phrase structure:
	* Machine translation: ""As Platon's' Phaidros' states at the end,""
	* Reference translation: ""As Plato states at the end of 'Phaidros'...""
		+ The machine translation uses a possessive pronoun (""Platon's"") instead of a possessive adjective (""Plato's""). This is a more common way to express possession in Estonian, but it may not be as clear in this context.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Platon's' Phaidros' lõpus märgib""
	* Reference translation: ""As Plato states at the end of 'Phaidros'...""
		+ The machine translation puts the possessive pronoun (""Platon's"") before the noun it modifies (""Phaidros""), while the reference translation puts it after the noun. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""words do not have wisdom in themselves""
	* Reference translation: ""As Plato states at the end of 'Phaidros'...""
		+ The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""in themselves"", which is a common way to express the idea of something being inherent or innate. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less accurate.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation uses more formal and idiomatic language, which is more appropriate for a literary work like Plato's ""Phaidros"". The machine translation, on the other hand, uses more informal language and makes some minor errors in word choice and phrase structure.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""tulles"" (meaning ""to release"") is not the most appropriate word choice in this context. A more suitable word would be ""freed"" or ""released"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the word ""heldin"" (meaning ""held in"") which is a more accurate word choice in this context, as it indicates that the prisoners were being held in the Tower.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is"") to describe the action of releasing the prisoners, which is not the most appropriate tense in this context. The reference translation uses the past tense (""were held"") to indicate that the prisoners were released in the past.
3. Phrasing:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses a more straightforward phrasing, which can sometimes result in a less natural-sounding translation. For example, ""One of the first things that Mortimer did when he came to England was the release of the prisoners held"" sounds more natural than ""One of the first things that Mortimer did when he came to England was the release of the prisoners"".

Machine Translation: ""This is why these terms can be called relatively historic.""

Reference Translation: ""This is why these concepts can be called relatively historical.""

The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""terms"" instead of ""concepts"" in the reference translation. This may be due to a difference in the source text or a limitation in the machine translation algorithm.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""can be called"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""can be called""). This may be a difference in the intended meaning or a choice made by the translator.
3. Lexical nuance: The reference translation uses the term ""historical"" to convey a more nuanced meaning than the machine translation's ""historic"". ""Historical"" implies a broader scope and a deeper understanding of the context, while ""historic"" is more general and may not convey the same level of depth.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses a more simplified sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a simple sentence with a single verb, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence with a subordinate clause.

Overall, the machine translation is a good starting point, but it could benefit from some revisions to improve its accuracy and nuance. The reference translation provides a more polished and accurate translation of the original Estonian text.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Ursula saab teada, et keegi on Torimi peale kaevanud ja ta aimab, kes see olla võiks."" (Ursula finds out that someone has extracted Torim and will find out who it could be.)
	* Reference translation: ""Ursula finds out that someone has snitched on Torim and she has an idea of who it could have been.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb ""saab"" (find out) in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""finds out"" in the past tense. Additionally, the machine translation uses the word ""kaevanud"" (extracted) instead of ""snitched"" in the reference translation.
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Torim"" (Torim)
	* Reference translation: ""Torim"" (Torim)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""Torim"" correctly, while the reference translation uses the same word.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kes see olla võiks"" (who it could be)
	* Reference translation: ""who it could have been""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""olla võiks"" (could be) instead of the idiomatic expression ""have been"" in the reference translation.
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Ursula saab teada, et keegi on Torimi peale kaevanud ja ta aimab, kes see olla võiks."" (Ursula finds out that someone has extracted Torim and will find out who it could be.)
	* Reference translation: ""Ursula finds out that someone has snitched on Torim and she has an idea of who it could have been.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure with multiple clauses, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a more straightforward verb tense.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and idiomatic expressions. While the machine translation gets the basic meaning of the sentence across, it lacks the nuance and detail of the reference translation. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

	* Reference translation: ""pakkusid"" (plural verb) is translated as ""offered"" in the reference translation.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The verb tense is inconsistent in the machine translation, with ""Zygmunt only increased"" in the past tense, but ""took over"" in the present tense.
	* Reference translation: The verb tense is consistent in the reference translation, with ""Zygmunt only increased"" in the past tense, matching the tense of ""took over"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""kaost"" (chaos) in the original Estonian text.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""chaos"" to convey the same meaning as the original Estonian text.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, with ""Zygmunt"" appearing before ""keeldumine"" (refusal) in the machine translation, while ""keeldumine"" appears before ""Zygmunt"" in the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the original word order in the sentence, with ""Zygmunt"" appearing after ""keeldumine"".
5. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation contains a grammatical error, with ""nõudmised"" (demands) in the machine translation, while the correct word in this context is ""nõudmised ainult"" (demands only).
	* Reference translation: The reference translation accurately captures the grammatical structure of the original Estonian text, with ""nõudmised ainult"" used to convey the correct meaning.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the original Estonian text. The reference translation captures the idiomatic expressions, grammatical structure, and word choice of the original text more accurately, making it a better translation overall.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Grammar and syntax:
The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the verb ""coincide"" in the second sentence. The verb should be ""coincides"" in the present tense. The reference translation gets this right.
2. Vocabulary:
The machine translation uses the word ""kokku"" instead of ""kriteeriumi"" in the first sentence. ""Kokku"" means ""criteria"" in Estonian, but in this context, it doesn't make sense. The reference translation uses the correct word ""kriteeriumi"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""iga aprioorne tõde"" in the second sentence. ""Aprioorne tõde"" means ""a priori truth"" in Estonian, and ""iga"" means ""every"". The reference translation gets this right.
4. Accuracy:
The machine translation changes the meaning of the sentence slightly. In the machine translation, it says ""so every priori truth is the universal truth"", while in the reference translation, it says ""so that every a priori truth is a universal truth"". The reference translation is more accurate, as ""a priori"" and ""universal"" have different meanings.
5. Fluency:
The machine translation sounds less natural and less fluent than the reference translation. The reference translation flows better and is more idiomatic in Estonian.

Based on these analyses, I would give the machine translation a score of 3 out of 5 and the reference translation a score of 4 out of 5. The machine translation has some grammatical errors and changes the meaning of the sentence slightly, while the reference translation is more accurate and sounds more natural.

	* Reference translation: ""There is support for the idea that the treatment of each disease must be viewed separately in the debate of fast transport versus treatment on site.""

The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure, with multiple clauses and prepositional phrases. The reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure, with a more straightforward organization of ideas.

3. Idiomatic expressions:

This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. In this case, both translations convey the same information, but the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding.
3. Tense: The machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation is in the past tense. This is because the strike has already happened, so the reference translation is more appropriate. However, the machine translation could be improved by using the past tense to match the reference translation.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""flights"" instead of ""flight,"" which is the correct word in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall accuracy of the translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation has a grammatical error in the phrase ""viissada viiskümmend lendu."" The correct phrase should be ""viissada viiskümmend lendust."" This is a common error in machine translations, as they often struggle with Estonian grammar and syntax.

	* Machine translation: ""That is why religious hatred often tries to find new evidence"" - The sentence structure is awkward and the use of ""often"" is incorrect. It should be ""That is why religious hatred tries to find new evidence often"".
	* Reference translation: ""That is why evil haters often try to find new evidence"" - The sentence structure is more natural and the use of ""evil haters"" is more appropriate than ""religious hatred"".
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""õelad vihkajad"" - The word ""õelad"" is not a suitable translation for ""hatred"" in this context. A more appropriate translation would be ""evil"" or ""malice"".
	* Reference translation: ""evil haters"" - The phrase ""evil haters"" is more accurate than ""õelad vihkajad"" in this context.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""proovides näiteks midagi ebaausa tunnustusestrateegia taolist"" - The phrase ""ebaausa tunnustusestrateegia taolist"" is not a common or idiomatic expression in English. A more appropriate translation would be ""to find new evidence to support their claims"".
	* Reference translation: ""but it is self-deceptive"" - This phrase is more idiomatic and natural in English than the machine translation.
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""uusi tõendeid"" - The word ""uusi"" means ""new"" in Estonian, but in this context, it doesn't make sense. A more appropriate translation would be ""new evidence"".
	* Reference translation: ""new evidence"" - This is a more accurate translation than the machine translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not very accurate and the word choice and grammar are not natural in English. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic, and it better conveys the meaning of the original Estonian sentence.

	* Reference translation: ""was sworn into office on the same day"" (correct use of ""sworn into office"")
3. Punctuation:
	* Machine translation: ""kes vannutati ka samal päeval ametisse"" (incorrect use of punctuation)
	* Reference translation: ""In the third round, the election was won by the only remaining candidate, the businessman Ahmad Ma ´ ītīq,"" (correct use of punctuation)
4. Spelling and capitalization:

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""cannons"" instead of ""water cannons"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are used"") in both parts of the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""were used"") in the second part of the sentence. This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame in which the action is taking place.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""ward off"" in the same way as the reference translation. The machine translation uses the phrase ""to ward off people"" instead of ""to ward off"". This is a more literal translation of the Estonian phrase, but it may not be as idiomatic or natural-sounding in English.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence slightly, placing ""water"" before ""cannons"" instead of after it. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and flow of the sentence.
5. Tone: The machine translation has a more formal tone than the reference translation, which is more conversational. This is a subjective difference, but it can affect the overall feel of the translation.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, word order, and tone. While the machine translation is generally understandable, it may not be as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation in some areas.

Machine Translation: ""An entirely ethical theory is not the only spiritual surroundings of these ideas.""

Reference Translation: ""Abstract ethical theory is not the only spiritual context of these ideas.""

Here are the differences I found between the two translations:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""surroundings"" instead of ""context."" While both words can be used to describe the broader context of an idea, ""surroundings"" implies a more physical or spatial relationship, while ""context"" is more neutral and can refer to any kind of environment.
2. Tone: The machine translation has a more formal and academic tone, while the reference translation is more conversational and informal. This is likely due to differences in the style guides used for each translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the idiomatic expression ""spiritual surroundings"" instead of the more literal ""spiritual context."" While both expressions can convey the idea of a broader spiritual context, ""spiritual surroundings"" is less common and may sound more awkward to some native English speakers.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the phrase ""these ideas."" This is likely due to a difference in the source text or the translator's preference for the present tense in this context.

Overall, while both translations convey the main idea of the sentence, the machine translation has some differences in word choice, tone, idiomatic expressions, and grammar compared to the reference translation. These differences may affect the clarity, readability, and naturalness of the translation, and may indicate that the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation.

Based on the above analysis, it can be seen that the machine translation has some errors in word choice, grammar, phrasing, and accuracy. For example, the machine translation uses the word ""Jeemenis"" instead of ""Juhitava"" to refer to the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia, and it also uses the word ""Araabia"" instead of ""Arabia"". Additionally, the machine translation does not use the correct idiomatic expression ""Shi'ite rebels"" in English, instead using the phrase ""mässuliste vahel"".

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""happy"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses ""happy with this"" in the first instance and ""happy if we 'd be looking ahead"" in the second instance. This difference in word choice may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""happy"" can have different connotations depending on the context.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense in both instances, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the second instance. This difference in tense may affect the meaning of the sentence, as the past tense can imply a completed action, while the present tense can imply an ongoing action.
3.

This difference in word order may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the word order can influence the emphasis and structure of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation includes an idiomatic expression ""d be looking ahead"" which is not present in the machine translation. This difference in idiomatic expressions may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as idiomatic expressions can convey nuanced meanings that may not be immediately apparent from the individual words.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the accusative case for the noun ""situation"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses the nominative case in the first instance and the accusative case in the second instance. This difference in grammar may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the case of a noun can influence the way the sentence is structured and the meaning of the sentence.

In the source and reference translations, the word order is ""Punase Risti esindaja teatel tuli Venemaa..."". This is a common difference between machine and human translations, as machines often struggle with word order in complex sentences.

Difference 2: Article usage

In the machine translation, the indefinite article ""a"" is used before ""move"", while in the source and reference translations, the definite article ""the"" is used. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Difference 3: Tense consistency

The machine translation uses the past tense ""came"" to describe Russia's move, while the source and reference translations use the present tense ""comes"". This is a difference in tense consistency, as the machine translation does not maintain the same tense throughout the sentence.

Difference 4: Word choice

The machine translation uses the word ""surprise"" to describe Russia's move, while the source and reference translations use the word ""surprised"". This is a minor difference in word choice, but it can affect the overall meaning and nuance of the sentence.

Difference 5: Idiomatic expressions

The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""as a surprise to them"", which is present in the source and reference translations. This is a difference in idiomatic expression, as the machine translation does not capture the nuance of the original sentence.

Conclusion:

Overall, the machine translation and reference translation have some differences in word order, article usage, tense consistency, word choice, and idiomatic expressions. While the machine translation is understandable, it does not capture the nuance and accuracy of the reference translation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating compared to the reference translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Paavst austab"" (Pope respects) vs. Reference translation: ""Paavst austab islamit"" (Pope respects Islam)
	* Machine translation: ""kuid ei tunnusta vägivalda propageerivat usku"" (but does not recognize religion that promotes violence) vs. Reference translation: ""kuid ei tunnusta vägivalda propageerivat usku"" (but does not recognize religion that promotes violence)
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Pope respects Islam but does not recognise religion that promotes violence."" vs. Reference translation: ""Pope respects Islam but does not recognise religion that promotes violence."" (both are grammatically correct)
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""promotes violence"" vs. Reference translation: ""promotes violence"" (both are grammatically correct, but the reference translation uses the same phrase as the source text)
4. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: ""Paavst austab islamit"" (Pope respects Islam) vs. Reference translation: ""Paavst austab islamit"" (Pope respects Islam) (both are grammatically correct, but the reference translation uses the same phrase as the source text)
5. Fluency:

(both are grammatically correct, but the reference translation is more fluent and natural-sounding)

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, cultural nuances, and fluency. The reference translation is generally more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. However, it's worth noting that the quality of machine translations can vary depending on the quality of the machine learning algorithms and the complexity of the source text, so it's possible that the machine translation could improve with better algorithms or more training data.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source Text: Kolmandat tüüpi toiming tekitab asja, eesmärk on valmistatav asi.
2. Machine Translation: A third-type operation creates the cause, the aim being the preparation of the matter.
3. Reference Translation: The third-type operation creates a thing , the aim is the thing being prepared .

Differences:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine Translation: ""creates the cause"" (tüüpi toiming tekitab) vs. Reference Translation: ""creates a thing"" (tüüpi tekitab)
	* Machine Translation: ""the aim being the preparation of the matter"" (eesmärk on valmistatav asi) vs. Reference Translation: ""the aim is the thing being prepared"" (eesmärk on valmistatav)
2. Grammar:
	* Machine Translation: uses the passive voice (""a third-type operation creates"") vs. Reference Translation: uses the active voice (""creates a thing"")
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine Translation: ""preparation of the matter"" (valmistatav asi) vs. Reference Translation: ""thing being prepared"" (asi valmistatav)

Conclusion:
The machine translation and reference translation have some differences in word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions.

* The machine translation uses the passive voice and translates ""tüüpi toiming"" as ""a third-type operation,"" which is not the most idiomatic way to express it in English.
* The reference translation uses the active voice and translates ""tüüpi toiming"" as ""creates a thing,"" which is a more idiomatic and natural way to express it in English.
* The machine translation translates ""eesmärk"" as ""the aim,"" which is not the most idiomatic way to express it in English. The reference translation uses ""the aim is"" which is a more idiomatic way to express it.

Overall, the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural in English compared to the machine translation.

Step 1: Reading the Source Text

The source text is in Estonian: ""Fränkeli järgi esitas õpetuse geomeetrilise jada kosmolisest tähtsusest Herakleitos.""

Step 2: Machine Translation

The machine translation of the source text is: ""According to Flunkeli, teaching was shown to be of geostrategic importance in Herakleito.""

Step 3: Reference Translation

The reference translation of the source text is: ""According to Fränkel, it was Heraclitus who presented the teaching of the importance of a geometric sequence.""

Comparison of Machine Translation and Reference Translation

The machine translation and reference translation differ in several areas:

1. Name of the philosopher: In the machine translation, the name of the philosopher is ""Flunkeli,"" while in the reference translation, it is ""Fränkel.""
2. Word order: In the machine translation, the words ""teaching was shown to be"" are in a different order than in the reference translation, where it is ""Heraclitus who presented.""
3. Meaning of the sentence: The machine translation changes the meaning of the sentence entirely, as ""geostrategic importance"" does not match the meaning of ""importance of a geometric sequence.""

Conclusion

Based on the comparison of the machine translation and reference translation, it is clear that the machine translation is of poor quality. The name of the philosopher is incorrect, the word order is different, and the meaning of the sentence is changed.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""ended in 1699"" (machine translation) vs. ""ended in 1699 the wars of the Holy League with the Ottoman state"" (reference translation)
	* The machine translation uses a present tense verb form (""ended"") to describe the event, while the reference translation uses a past tense verb form (""ended"") to indicate that the event occurred in the past.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Lõplik Karlowitzi rahu lõpetas"" (machine translation) vs. ""The final Karlowitz peace ended"" (reference translation)

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""opportunity"" instead of ""compromise procedure"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly. In this case, both phrases convey the same general idea, but ""opportunity"" may sound more formal or generic, while ""compromise procedure"" is more specific and accurate.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""offered"") in both parts of the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""offered"") in the first part and the present tense (""an opportunity"") in the second part. This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame of the action being described. The machine translation is more consistent in its use of the present tense, but the reference translation is more accurate in reflecting the original sentence's past tense structure.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""kokkuleppemenetlust"" (which can be translated as ""a compromise procedure""), while the reference translation uses the more idiomatic and natural-sounding phrase ""kokkuleppemenetlust"". This is a significant difference, as the idiomatic expression used in the reference translation is more likely to be understood by native English speakers.
4. Word order: The machine translation and the reference translation differ in their word order. The machine translation places the prepositional phrase ""kenderile oportuniteiti"" (meaning ""to Kender"") after the verb ""offered"", while the reference translation places it before the verb. This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall clarity and readability of the sentence.

Overall, while the machine translation is generally accurate, there are some minor differences in word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and word order that may affect the overall quality of the translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Soomusrongi Rügemendi"" (Soomusrong Rübig)
	* Reference translation: ""Armored Train Regiment""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""Rügemendi"" which is not a correct Estonian word. The reference translation uses the correct term ""Armored Train Regiment"".
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""kus teenis kuus aastat soomusrongil Kapten Irv""
	* Reference translation: ""where Captain Irv served for six years on the armored train""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the incorrect verb form ""teenis"" (meaning ""where"") instead of ""tee"" (meaning ""where he served""). Additionally, the machine translation uses the wrong word order in the sentence.
3. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Kapten Irv""
	* Reference translation: ""Captain Irv""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the incorrect spelling of the name ""Irv"".
4. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The translation seems to be a random combination of words, rather than a coherent sentence.
	* Reference translation: The sentence is grammatically correct and easy to understand.
	* Difference: The machine translation lacks fluency and coherence, while the reference translation is well-structured and easy to understand.

Overall, the machine translation is of poor quality compared to the reference translation. The machine translation contains several errors in word choice, grammar, and vocabulary, and lacks fluency and coherence. The reference translation, on the other hand, is well-written and easy to understand.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""It is assumed that either the wall or the main valley of the urban environment were the first to be prepared.""
	* Reference translation: ""It is assumed that either the ring wall of the fortress or the main tower were completed first.""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""urban environment"" instead of ""fortress"" in the reference translation. This is a common mistake in machine translations, as they often struggle to understand the context and nuances of specialized terminology.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Oletatavasti valmis esimesena kas linnuse ringmüür või peatorn.""
	* Reference translation: ""It is assumed that either the ring wall of the fortress or the main tower were completed first.""

The machine translation uses the present tense ""valmis"" (prepared) instead of the past tense ""completed"" in the reference translation. This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall fluency and accuracy of the translation.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Either the wall or the main valley of the urban environment were the first to be prepared.""
	* Reference translation: ""Either the ring wall of the fortress or the main tower were completed first.""

The machine translation changes the word order in the sentence, placing ""urban environment"" after ""wall"" instead of before it. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less accurate.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""It is assumed that either the wall or the main valley of the urban environment were the first to be prepared.""
	* Reference translation: ""It is assumed that either the ring wall of the fortress or the main tower were completed first.""

The machine translation doesn't quite capture the idiomatic expression ""first to be prepared"" in the reference translation. This is a common issue in machine translations, as they may not fully understand the cultural and linguistic nuances of the source language.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more natural and idiomatic expression, while the machine translation introduces errors in word choice, grammar, and word order. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Uus Badoglio valitsus"" should be ""The new Badoglio Government"" in English.
	* Reference translation: ""keelustades fašistliku partei"" should be ""banned the fascist party"" in English.
2. Word choice and terminology:
	* Machine translation: ""fascist rule"" is not a common term in English, and ""fascist party"" would be more appropriate.
	* Reference translation: ""fašistliku valitsemise elemendid"" should be ""elements of fascist rule"" in English.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""viimased"" should be ""last"" in English.
	* Reference translation: ""Uus Badoglio valitsus"" should be ""The new Badoglio Government"" in English.
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""Badoglio valitsus"" is not a correct term in English, and ""Badoglio Government"" is more appropriate.
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure and word choice in the machine translation are not as fluent and natural-sounding as the reference translation.

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation. The machine translation has some errors in grammar, word choice, and idiomatic expressions, and the sentence structure is not as fluent as the reference translation. However, it's important to note that machine translation is a complex task and can be challenging to produce high-quality translations, especially for less common or technical terms.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""One alternative is the view that concepts take on the definition of meaning.""
	* Reference translation: ""One alternative is the view that concepts acquire meaning from the definition.""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""take on"" instead of ""acquire meaning from"". This difference in word choice may not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does indicate that the machine translation may not have fully captured the nuances of the original Estonian text.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""mõisted omandavad tähenduse definitsioonist.""
	* Reference translation: ""One alternative is the view that concepts acquire meaning from the definition.""

The machine translation uses the accusative case for the noun ""tähenduse"" (meaning ""concepts""), which is incorrect in Estonian. In Estonian, the accusative case is used for direct objects, not for nouns that are the subject of a sentence. The reference translation correctly uses the nominative case for ""tähenduse"".

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Üks alternatiiv on vaade, et mõisted omandavad tähenduse definitsioonist.""
	* Reference translation: ""One alternative is the view that concepts acquire meaning from the definition.""

The machine translation reverses the word order in the sentence, which can make it harder to understand the meaning of the sentence. In Estonian, the typical word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), so the sentence should read ""Mõisted omandavad tähenduse definitsioonist üks alternatiiv.""

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""mõisted omandavad tähenduse definitsioonist.""
	* Reference translation: ""One alternative is the view that concepts acquire meaning from the definition.""

The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""mõisted omandavad"" in the original Estonian text. This expression is a common way to express the idea of ""concepts taking on meaning"" in Estonian, and it is important to preserve this nuance in the translation.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation has some errors in word choice, grammar, and word order. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and idiomatic in its translation. Overall, the reference translation is a better representation of the original Estonian text.

	* Reference translation: ""et ükski riik peale agressori olnud sõjaks valmis"" (Estonian) -> ""no country, except for the aggressor, was prepared to go to war"" (correct use of ""except for"")
4. Sentence structure:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""At the same time, there will be a new author, Jauram, who will bring an invitation to Rome.""
	* Reference translation: ""At the same time, Jauram comes to Uuevabriku and brings summons for Riks.""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""new author"" instead of ""Jauram"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""who will bring an invitation to Rome.""
	* Reference translation: ""comes to Uuevabriku and brings summons for Riks.""

The machine translation uses the present tense ""will bring"" instead of the present perfect ""comes"" in the reference translation. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less accurate.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""At the same time, there will be a new author, Jauram, who will bring an invitation to Rome.""
	* Reference translation: ""At the same time, Jauram comes to Uuevabriku and brings summons for Riks.""

The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""new author"" before ""Jauram"" instead of after it. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less clear.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""invitation to Rome.""
	* Reference translation: ""summons for Riks.""

The machine translation uses a literal translation of the Estonian phrase ""kutsus Riks"" instead of using the idiomatic expression ""summons for Riks."" This can make the sentence sound less natural and less accurate.

5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""Rome.""
	* Reference translation: ""Uuevabriku.""

The machine translation uses the name of a famous city in Italy, while the reference translation uses the name of a fictional place in Estonian literature. This can make the sentence less clear and less accurate for readers who are not familiar with Estonian culture.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation uses more idiomatic expressions and cultural references that are specific to Estonian literature, making it a more reliable and accurate translation.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""raskus"" (difficulty) is not a suitable word choice for the context, as it means ""hard"" or ""difficult"" in Estonian, but the intended meaning is ""greater"" or ""more complex"".
	* Reference translation: ""sest"" (as) is not necessary in the reference translation, as the meaning is already clear from the context.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""mõistetest"" (what exists) is not a common or idiomatic expression in Estonian, and it doesn't convey the same meaning as ""what exists"" in English.
	* Reference translation: ""mitte mõistetest"" (not the concepts) is a more idiomatic expression in Estonian, as it conveys the idea that Aristotle is not discussing the concepts themselves, but rather what exists in the world.
4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone and style of the machine translation are not as polished or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The use of ""speaks clearly"" in the machine translation sounds more formal and less conversational than the reference translation's ""speaks clearly of what exists"".

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate, natural-sounding, and idiomatic than the machine translation. While the machine translation is a good starting point, it needs more work to improve its grammar, word choice, and tone to produce a high-quality translation.

2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""was able to visit"" instead of the reference translation's ""kissed"" and ""visited"". This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with tense consistency.
3. Number agreement: The machine translation has a different number agreement than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""the Koran"" is singular, while in the reference translation, it is plural (""the Qurans"").
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""mosques"" instead of the reference translation's ""mosque"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
5. Grammar: The machine translation has a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence is structured as a simple sentence, while in the reference translation, it is structured as a compound sentence with a subordinate clause.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has errors in word order, tense, number agreement, and grammar, which can affect the overall meaning and clarity of the sentence. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. [/INST]"

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation:

* ""But even if the curve can be changed"" is translated as ""But even if the curve can be changed"" instead of ""But even if the curve can be altered"" or ""But even if the curve can be modified"" (which would be more accurate).
* ""it is still self-deception"" is translated as ""it is still self-deception"" instead of ""it is still a form of self-deception"" or ""it is still a type of self-deception"" (which would be more accurate).

Reference Translation:

* ""Aga isegi kui kõverat õnnestub muuta"" is translated as ""But even if the curve can be changed"" instead of ""Even if the curve can be changed"" or ""Despite the curve being changed"" (which would be more accurate).
* ""on ikkagi tegu enesepettusega"" is translated as ""it is still self-deception"" instead of ""it is still a form of self-deception"" or ""it is still a type of self-deception"" (which would be more accurate).

Overall, the machine translation makes a few minor errors in word choice and grammar, but the overall meaning of the sentence is still conveyed accurately. However, the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Estonian, and it uses more accurate word choices and grammar to convey the intended meaning.

Based on this analysis, I would give the machine translation a score of 60% and the reference translation a score of 80%.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""Other British vessels continued to arrive"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed at the end.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""continued"" to describe the arrival of the British vessels, while the reference translation uses the present tense ""continue"" to indicate that the vessels are still arriving.
3. Prepositions: The machine translation uses ""a battlefield"" instead of ""at full strength for battle"" in the reference translation. This change in prepositioning affects the meaning of the sentence, as ""a battlefield"" implies a specific location where a battle is taking place, while ""at full strength for battle"" indicates that the fleet is ready and able to fight at full capacity.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""jätkasid"" (meaning ""vessels"") instead of ""lahinguks"" (meaning ""fleet"") in the reference translation. This change in word choice affects the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""jätkasid"" implies a smaller number of vessels, while ""lahinguks"" implies a larger, more comprehensive fleet.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the accusative case for the word ""Briti"" (meaning ""British"") in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the nominative case. This change in grammar affects the meaning of the sentence, as the accusative case implies that the British vessels are the direct object of the action, while the nominative case implies that they are the subject of the action.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have significant differences in terms of word order, tense, prepositions, word choice, and grammar. These differences affect the meaning and accuracy of the translation, and the machine translation is not as effective as the reference translation in conveying the intended message.

		+ The machine translation uses the word ""peetud"" (lit. ""translated"") to indicate that the result is excellent, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""considered to be an election favourite"" to convey the same meaning.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Rahvusrinne saavutas 25% häältega paremuselt teise tulemuse"" (lit. ""The people's union achieved 25% more excellent than the other result"")
	* Reference translation: ""achieved a second result with 25% of the vote""

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Grammar and syntax:
The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the preposition ""for"" in the second sentence. The reference translation uses the correct preposition ""to"" in both sentences.
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
The machine translation uses the word ""importance"" in both sentences, which is a good choice, but the reference translation uses the word ""importance to people"" in the second sentence, which is a more accurate translation of the Estonian original.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""inimeste tähtsusest universumile"" in the source sentence, which means ""of people to the universe"". The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""inimeste tähtsusest inimestele"" in the second sentence, which means ""of people to people"".
4. Cultural references:
The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the Estonian sentence, which is a phrase that is commonly used in Estonian to express the idea of people being important to each other. The reference translation captures this cultural nuance by using the phrase ""to people"".
5. Fluency and naturalness:
The machine translation sounds less natural and less fluent than the reference translation. The reference translation flows better and is more idiomatic in English.

Based on these analyses, I would give the machine translation a score of 3 out of 10 and the reference translation a score of 8 out of 10. The reference translation is more accurate, idiomatic, and natural-sounding than the machine translation.

	* Machine translation: ""moraalsed kaalutlused"" (moral considerations)
	* Reference translation: ""moral considerations""

The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""moraalsed kaalutlused"" to translate the English term ""moral considerations."" While this phrase is technically correct, it may not be the most idiomatic or natural-sounding translation in English. The reference translation uses the more common term ""moral considerations"" to convey the same meaning.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""toetavad"" (to support)
	* Reference translation: ""are supported""

The machine translation uses the Estonian verb ""toetavad"" to translate the English verb ""to support."" While this verb is technically correct, it may not be the most idiomatic or natural-sounding translation in English. The reference translation uses the more common phrase ""are supported"" to convey the same meaning.

4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The initial commitment is the conclusion that moral considerations support and are the candidate for a real commitment.
	* Reference translation: An initial commitment is a conclusion that is supported by moral considerations and is a candidate for a real commitment.

The machine translation has a more formal and impersonal tone, while the reference translation has a more conversational and informal tone. The reference translation also uses more active and descriptive verbs to convey the meaning of the sentence.

Overall, while the machine translation is grammatically correct, it lacks the nuance and naturalness of the reference translation. The reference translation better conveys the meaning and tone of the original sentence, making it a more accurate and helpful translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""where the border with the Congo is situated"" is placed at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed earlier in the sentence.
2. Prepositions: The machine translation uses the preposition ""along"" to indicate the location of the border, while the reference translation uses the preposition ""across.""
3. Tense: The machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation is in the past tense. This is likely due to the fact that the reference translation is a literal translation of the Estonian original, which was written in the past tense.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""coastline"" instead of ""coast,"" which is the word used in the reference translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation has a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence is structured as a simple sentence, while in the reference translation, it is structured as a compound sentence with a subordinate clause.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has some errors in word choice, preposition usage, and grammatical structure, which can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, is a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Estonian original.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation keeps the original word order of the source text, while the reference translation changes the word order to better fit the English sentence structure. For example, in the machine translation, ""Venemaa president"" is translated as ""Russian President,"" while in the reference translation, it's translated as ""Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.""
2. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""Special Representative of the President to NATO,"" while the reference translation omits it. In Estonian, the definite article is not used before a proper noun, so the reference translation is more accurate.
3. Name translation: The machine translation translates ""Dmitri Medvedev"" as ""Dmitry Medvedev,"" which is the more common English spelling of the name. However, the reference translation uses the more formal spelling ""Dmitri Medvedev"" to match the original Russian name.
4. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense for the verb ""released,"" while the reference translation uses the past tense ""dismissed."" This is because the original Russian sentence is in the past tense, so the reference translation is more accurate.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""Special Representative"" as the translation for ""erinesindaja,"" while the reference translation uses ""Special Representative of the President."" This is a more accurate translation, as ""erinesindaja"" specifically refers to the representative of the President.
6. Punctuation: The machine translation omits the comma after ""NATO,"" while the reference translation includes it. This is a matter of style, but the reference translation is more consistent with English punctuation conventions.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. While the machine translation is a good starting point, it's important to review and revise it to ensure that it's as accurate and natural-sounding as possible.

4. Name spelling: The machine translation spells the name ""Ludvig"" with a ""d"" instead of a ""c"" in the middle, which is the correct spelling according to the reference translation.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""next"" to describe the birth of Ludvig, while the reference translation uses the word ""next son"".

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source Text:

The source text is in Estonian, and it reads: ""Kõik ained seal koosnevad neljast elemendist õhust, maast, tulest ja veest, mille proportsioonid segus määravad aine omadused.""

2. Machine Translation:

The machine translation of the source text is: ""All substances in it consist of four elements of air, land, fire and water, the proportions of which determine the characteristics of the substance.""

3. Reference Translation:

The reference translation of the source text is: ""All substances in it consist of four elements of air , earth , fire and water , the proportions of which determine the characteristics of the substance.""

Comparison:

The machine translation and reference translation both translate the phrase ""Kõik ained seal koosnevad"" as ""All substances in it consist of."" However, the machine translation adds the word ""of"" in the second sentence, which is not present in the source text or reference translation.

Additionally, the machine translation changes the word order in the second sentence, placing ""air"" before ""land"" and ""fire"" before ""water."" This is not the same as the source text and reference translation, which maintain the original word order.

4. Other differences:

The machine translation also changes the word ""maast"" in the source text to ""land"" in the translation, which is not a direct equivalent. In the reference translation, ""maast"" is translated as ""earth.""

Furthermore, the machine translation adds the word ""the"" before ""proportsioonid"" in the source text, which is not present in the source text or reference translation.

5. Conclusion:

Based on the analysis above, it is clear that the machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate translation of the source text.

Therefore, I would give the machine translation a rating of 2 out of 5, indicating that it is not a reliable or accurate translation. The reference translation, with a rating of 5 out of 5, provides a much more accurate and faithful translation of the source text.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""marksmen"" (singular)
	* Reference translation: ""athletes"" (plural)

The machine translation uses the term ""marksmen"" which is not accurate as the original Estonian text uses the plural form ""paraathletes"".

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""In addition to sports marksmen, support for marksmen is also being addressed.""
	* Reference translation: ""In addition to regular athletes, support is also provided to paraathletes.""

The machine translation uses the present tense ""is being addressed"" which is not accurate as the original Estonian text uses the present participle ""are being addressed"" to indicate ongoing action.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""tegeletakse"" (verb form)
	* Reference translation: ""provided""

The machine translation uses the verb form ""tegeletakse"" which is not a direct translation of the English word ""provided"". A more accurate translation would be ""provided"".

4. Word order:

	* Reference translation: ""to paraathletes""

The machine translation changes the word order of the original Estonian sentence, which can make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. A more accurate translation would be ""to paraathletes"".

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a score of 3/10.

1. Source Text: Kumbagi seadust praktikas siiski järjekindlalt ei rakendata.
2. Machine Translation: However, neither law is being applied consistently in practice.
3. Reference Translation: However , neither law is being applied consistently in practice .

Difference 1: Word order

The machine translation changes the word order of the source text. In the source text, the words ""Kumbagi seadust"" come before ""praktikas"", but in the machine translation, they come after. This is a common mistake in machine translation, as the algorithm may not always prioritize the correct word order.

Difference 2: Word choice

The machine translation uses the word ""law"" instead of ""seadust"" in the source text. ""Seadust"" means ""law"" in Estonian, but it's a more formal and technical term, while ""law"" is a more general term that can refer to any set of rules or regulations. The reference translation uses the term ""seadust"" to maintain the accuracy of the source text.

Difference 3: Tense consistency

The machine translation changes the tense of the sentence, moving from the present tense in the source text to the past tense in the machine translation. This can make the translation sound less natural and less accurate.

Difference 4: Idiomatic expressions

The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""järjekindlalt"" in the source text. This phrase is a common expression in Estonian that means ""in practice"", but it's not a direct translation of any English phrase. The reference translation includes this idiomatic expression to maintain the nuance of the source text.

Difference 5: Grammar

The machine translation changes the grammar of the sentence, moving from the passive voice in the source text to the active voice in the machine translation. This can make the translation sound less natural and less accurate.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation maintains the word order, word choice, tense consistency, idiomatic expressions, and grammar of the source text more closely, making it a more reliable and natural-sounding translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source: ""See kõik suurendas eestlaste meelepaha Nõukogude võimu vastu.""
Machine Translation: ""This all increased the indignation of the Estonians against the Soviet regime.""
Reference Translation: ""This all increased the indignation of the Estonians against the Soviet regime.""

The machine translation and reference translation are similar in that they both convey the same meaning and message. However, there are some differences in the way they express it.

2. Word choice and terminology:
The machine translation uses the phrase ""increased the indignation"" while the reference translation uses ""increased the indignation of the Estonians."" This subtle difference in wording may affect the overall tone and connotation of the translation. The machine translation uses a more general term for ""indignation,"" while the reference translation uses a more specific term that emphasizes the identity of the Estonians.
3. Grammar and sentence structure:
The machine translation and reference translation have the same basic sentence structure, with the subject ""See kõik suurendas eestlaste"" followed by the verb ""meelepaha."" However, the machine translation uses the passive voice (""was increased"") while the reference translation uses the active voice (""increased""). This difference in sentence structure may affect the clarity and readability of the translation.
4. Idiomatic expressions and cultural references:
The machine translation does not include any idiomatic expressions or cultural references that are specific to Estonian or the Soviet regime. The reference translation, on the other hand, includes a cultural reference to the Estonian language by using the phrase ""eestlaste meelepaha."" This may affect the accuracy and cultural relevance of the translation.
5. Fluency and naturalness:
The machine translation and reference translation have different levels of fluency and naturalness. The machine translation may sound more stilted or awkward in certain phrases, while the reference translation flows more smoothly and naturally. This may be due to the complexity of the source text or the limitations of the machine translation algorithm.

Based on these differences, I would rate the quality of the Estonian-English translation as follows:

Machine Translation: 60% (good for basic understanding, but lacks nuance and cultural relevance)
Reference Translation: 80% (more accurate and culturally relevant, but may have some minor errors in grammar or word choice)

Overall, while both translations convey the basic meaning of the source text, the reference translation is more accurate and culturally relevant, while the machine translation may lack some nuance and naturalness.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Paavst kutsus 5. detsembril 2010 kõiki palvetama nende eest"" (incorrectly uses the genitive case after ""kõiki palvetama"")
	* Reference translation: ""On the 5th of December 2010, the Pope invited everyone to pray for those who are suffering violence."" (correctly uses the genitive case after ""invited"")
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kannatavad vägivalla käes"" (incorrectly uses the word ""vägivalla"", which means ""on the road"")
	* Reference translation: ""those who are suffering violence"" (correctly translates ""käes"" as ""violence"")
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kõiki palvetama"" (incorrectly uses the phrase ""kõiki palvetama"", which is not a common or idiomatic expression in Estonian)
	* Reference translation: ""On the 5th of December 2010"" (correctly uses the idiomatic expression ""On the 5th of December"")
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Paavst kutsus 5. detsembril 2010 kõiki palvetama nende eest, kes kannatavad vägivalla käes."" (incorrectly places the verb ""kutsus"" at the end of the sentence)
	* Reference translation: ""On the 5th of December 2010, the Pope invited everyone to pray for those who are suffering violence."" (correctly places the verb ""invited"" at the beginning of the sentence)

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, word choice, and idiomatic expressions, which can make the sentence difficult to understand or sound unnatural in English. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""should be our ultimate objective"" (MT) vs. ""can also be put into question"" (Ref)

1. Source Text: Temas olev ergas Mõistus äratas siiski tema mõtlemisvõime.
Machine Translation: However, the private sense in which he was present has awakened his ability to think.
Reference Translation: However, the bright Reason in him awakened his ability to think.

Difference 1: Word Choice (Private vs. Bright Reason)

In the machine translation, the word ""private"" is used to translate the Estonian word ""temas"". However, in the reference translation, the word ""bright"" is used to translate the same word. This difference in word choice may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""private"" connotes a more personal or intimate sense, while ""bright"" implies a more general or abstract sense.

Difference 2: Tense (Present vs. Awakened)

In the machine translation, the verb ""has awakened"" is used to translate the Estonian verb ""äratas"". However, in the reference translation, the verb ""awakened"" is used instead. This difference in tense may affect the timing of the action, as ""has awakened"" implies that the action of awakening occurred in the past, while ""awakened"" implies that the action is ongoing or has just occurred.

Difference 3: Word Order (Ability vs. Reason)

In the machine translation, the phrase ""his ability to think"" is used to translate the Estonian phrase ""mõtlemisvõime"". However, in the reference translation, the phrase ""the ability to think"" is used instead. This difference in word order may affect the emphasis of the sentence, as the reference translation places the emphasis on the ability itself, while the machine translation places it on the person who possesses the ability.

Difference 4: Idiomatic Expressions (Awakened vs. Bright)

In the machine translation, the phrase ""awakened his ability to think"" is used. However, in the reference translation, the phrase ""the bright Reason in him awakened his ability to think"" is used. This difference in idiomatic expressions may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the reference translation uses a more poetic and figurative language to convey the idea of a bright, inner light that awakens the ability to think.

In conclusion, there are several differences between the machine translation and the reference translation of the Estonian sentence. These differences may affect the overall meaning, tone, and style of the sentence, and highlight the importance of using high-quality, human-made translations in professional contexts.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the verb ""buy"" is placed at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed earlier in the sentence.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""its intention"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""informs""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Prepositions: The machine translation uses the preposition ""in"" before ""café"" while the reference translation uses ""in the cafeteria"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the clarity of the sentence.
4. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""its"" before ""car"" while the reference translation uses the indefinite article ""a"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the meaning of the sentence.
5. Name usage: The machine translation uses the name ""Jürka"" while the reference translation uses ""Jürkale"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the clarity of the sentence.

	* Reference translation: ""their own"" (omakorra)
	* Difference: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""omakorra"" which is commonly used in Estonian to refer to something that belongs to oneself.
5. Cultural references:

	* Reference translation: ""the largest groups were of European origin, as well as Chinese and the Arabs.""
	* Difference: The machine translation does not capture the cultural nuances of the sentence, as the term ""European origin"" may not be immediately clear to non-Estonian speakers. In Estonian, the term ""eestlane"" is used to refer to people of European origin.

	* Machine translation: The machine translation changes the word order in the second clause, placing the verb ""paid"" before the noun ""attention"". In the reference translation, the word order is reversed, with ""attention"" coming before the verb ""paid"".
5. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation gets the overall meaning of the sentence correct, but there are some minor errors in word choice and grammar.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation is more accurate in terms of word choice and grammar, and it also captures the nuances of the original sentence better.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation also captures the nuances of the original sentence better, such as the use of the idiomatic expression ""greater attention"" and the reversal of the word order in the second clause.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""The tree is a murder"" (incorrect) should be ""The tree is murderous"" (correct).
	* Machine translation: ""its examinations kill"" (incorrect) should be ""its branches kill"" (correct).
	* Machine translation: ""its thief is fuelled by hatred"" (incorrect) should be ""its shadow is radiating hatred"" (correct).
	* Machine translation: ""its papers contain fraud"" (incorrect) should be ""its leaves conceal fraud"" (correct).
	* Machine translation: ""its findings are weakened by the oil of evil"" (incorrect) should be ""its blossoms ooze the oil of evil"" (correct).
2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""mõru"" (incorrect) should be ""bitter"" (correct).
	* Machine translation: ""õhkab"" (incorrect) should be ""radiating"" (correct).
	* Machine translation: ""viha"" (incorrect) should be ""hatred"" (correct).

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""All of these views either accept emotion as a psychological state or completely reject it."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""All of these views either accept emotion as a psychological state or completely reject it."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense, which is ""either accept"" instead of ""either accept or completely reject.""

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kas aktsepteerivad"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""accept"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the word ""aktsepteerivad,"" which means ""to approve"" or ""to accept,"" but in this context, it should be ""accept.""

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""emotsiooni kui psühholoogilist seisundit"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""emotions as psychological states"" (correct)

The machine translation uses a phrase that is not commonly used in English, ""emotsiooni kui psühholoogilist seisundit,"" which means ""emotions as psychological states."" A more idiomatic expression in English would be ""emotions as psychological experiences.""

4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""või siis lükkavad"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""or completely reject it"" (correct)

The machine translation uses a sentence structure that is not common in English, ""või siis lükkavad,"" which means ""or completely reject."" A more idiomatic expression in English would be ""or completely reject it.""

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""There is a tension between antiquity and the modern philosophy""
	* Reference translation: ""There is a tension between antique philosophy and modern philosophy""

The machine translation uses the term ""antiquity"" instead of ""antique philosophy"". This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""When it comes to questions of philosophy and Hutus""
	* Reference translation: ""When it comes to questions of philosophy and centres of interest""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""and Hutus"" at the end of the sentence, which is not present in the reference translation. This may indicate that the machine translation is not fully understanding the context of the sentence.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""inge antiikfilosoofia ja uusaja filosoofia vahel""
	* Reference translation: ""antique philosophy and modern philosophy""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""inge antiikfilosoofia ja uusaja filosoofia vahel"", which is not a common or idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic expression ""antique philosophy and modern philosophy"".

4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Filosoofia küsimuste ja huvikeskmete puhul on pinge antiikfilosoofia ja uusaja filosoofia vahel.""
	* Reference translation: ""There is a tension between antique philosophy and modern philosophy when it comes to questions of philosophy and centres of interest.""

The machine translation and the reference translation have different sentence structures. The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure with multiple clauses, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a clear subject and verb.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation. The machine translation uses some words and phrases that are not common in English, and it also has difficulty with the sentence structure and idiomatic expressions. Overall, the reference translation is more natural and accurate in conveying the meaning of the Estonian sentence.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""If the Commission's app fails to comply with the Committee's guidelines""
	* Reference translation: ""If the commission agent does not follow the instructions of the commissioner""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the term ""app"" instead of ""agent"" to refer to the person or entity responsible for carrying out the commission.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""the Committee's successor can read that the Commission's commercial transaction has not been made at the expense of the Committee's""
	* Reference translation: ""the commissioner may consider that the transaction made by the commissioner has not been made at the expense of the committee""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the passive voice in the second sentence, which makes it less clear who is performing the action. In the reference translation, the active voice is used to make it clearer that it is the commissioner who is considering the matter.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""the Commission's commercial transaction has not been made at the expense of the Committee's""
	* Reference translation: ""the transaction made by the commissioner has not been made at the expense of the committee""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the phrase ""at the expense of"" which is not a common idiomatic expression in English. In the reference translation, the phrase ""at the expense of"" is used to convey the idea that the commissioner is not responsible for the cost of the transaction.
4. Clarity:
	* Machine translation: ""If the Commission's app fails to comply with the Committee's guidelines, the Committee's successor can read that the Commission's commercial transaction has not been made at the expense of the Committee's""
	* Reference translation: ""If the commission agent does not follow the instructions of the commissioner, the commissioner may consider that the transaction made by the commissioner has not been made at the expense of the committee""
	* Difference: The machine translation is less clear and concise than the reference translation. It uses more words to convey the same meaning, and the sentence structure is less straightforward.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""At least any value can blatantly contradict other true values in principle."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Any value can, at least in principle, blamefully contradict other true values."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the word ""blatantly"" incorrectly, as it is not a suitable word to use in this context. The reference translation uses the word ""blamefully"" instead, which is more appropriate to convey the intended meaning.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""vähemalt"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""at least"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the word ""vähemalt"" which means ""somewhat"" or ""a little"" in Estonian, but in this context, it doesn't make sense. The reference translation uses the word ""at least"" which is a more appropriate choice to convey the idea of a minimum or a minimum amount.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""laiduväärselt"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""in principle"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the phrase ""laiduväärselt"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the phrase ""in principle"" which is a more common and idiomatic way to express the idea of a general or fundamental rule.

4. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone is more formal and stiff, while the reference translation is more conversational and natural.

The machine translation uses a more formal and stiff tone, which may not be suitable for all types of texts. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses a more conversational and natural tone, which is more appropriate for informal or casual writing.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not of high quality and requires significant improvement. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and natural-sounding, making it a better choice for Estonian-English translation.

	* Machine translation: ""leppega võetud kohustuste ajutisest peatamisest"" (lit. ""the temporary suspension of obligations in the fulfillment of the agreement"")
	* Reference translation: ""the temporary suspension of the commitments assumed under the agreement""

The machine translation uses the word ""leppega"" (lit. ""temporary"") to indicate the duration of the suspension, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""the commitments assumed under the agreement"" to clarify the context.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""teatanud leppega võetud kohustuste ajutisest peatamisest"" (lit. ""announced a temporary suspension of obligations in the fulfillment of the agreement"")
	* Reference translation: ""announced a temporary suspension of the commitments assumed under the agreement""

The machine translation uses the verb ""teatanud"" (lit. ""announced"") in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""announced"" in the simple past tense to match the time frame of the event.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""oli president Vladimir Putin teatanud leppega võetud kohustuste ajutisest peatamisest"" (lit. ""was President Vladimir Putin announced a temporary suspension of obligations in the fulfillment of the agreement"")
	* Reference translation: ""was President Vladimir Putin announced a temporary suspension of the commitments assumed under the agreement""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""oli president"" (lit. ""was President"") to indicate the speaker's attitude towards the person mentioned, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""was announced"" to convey the same meaning in a more idiomatic way.

4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""peatamisest"" (lit. ""fulfillment"")
	* Reference translation: ""the agreement""

The machine translation places the word ""peatamisest"" (lit. ""fulfillment"") after the verb ""teatanud"" (lit. ""announced""), while the reference translation places it before the verb to emphasize the context.

5. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""Vladimir Putin"" (lit. ""Vladimir Putin"")
	* Reference translation: ""Vladimir Putin"" (lit. ""Vladimir Putin"")

The machine translation accurately translates the name ""Vladimir Putin"", while the reference translation also accurately translates the name.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation has some inaccuracies in word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions, and the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic. However, both translations convey the same meaning, which is that President Putin announced a temporary suspension of the commitments assumed under the agreement.

	* Machine translation: ""lahkumisest"" (genitive case of ""lahkumine"" in Estonian) is translated as ""of the party involved in the corruption scandal"" in English, which is a bit wordy and could be simplified to ""involved in the corruption scandal"".
2. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""korruptsiooniskandaali"" (Estonian term for ""corruption scandal"") is translated as ""corruption scandal"" in English, which is a more straightforward and idiomatic translation.
3. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure in the machine translation is different from the reference translation. The machine translation starts with the subject ""In Lithuania"" and then adds the verb ""has announced"", while the reference translation starts with the subject ""In Lithuania"" and then adds the verb ""announced that it has left"".

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""sub-doses"" are placed after the verb ""were invaded,"" while in the reference translation, they are placed before the verb. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with word order and sentence structure.
2. Accuracy of translation: The machine translation gets the meaning of the sentence correct, but it makes a small error in the word choice. In the machine translation, the Alemanns are referred to as ""sub-doses,"" which is not the correct term. In the reference translation, the Alemanns are correctly translated as ""Alemanns.""
3. Grammar and syntax: The machine translation has some grammatical errors. For example, the verb ""were invaded"" is in the plural form, but it should be in the singular form to match the subject ""borders of Rome."" Additionally, the machine translation uses the wrong verb form for the subordinate clause ""by sub-doses."" In the reference translation, the verb form is correct.
4. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses a different word than the reference translation to translate the Estonian word ""tungisid."" In the machine translation, the word is translated as ""sub-doses,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""Alemanns.""

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word order, accuracy of translation, grammar and syntax, and vocabulary.

1. ""A contract of bail-in"" vs. ""a service contract""
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the term ""contract of bail-in,"" which is not a commonly used term in English. In English, a bailment is a legal term that refers to the act of delivering something to another person for safekeeping, while a contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties. Therefore, the machine translation is not accurate in this instance.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the term ""service contract,"" which is a more common and accurate term in English. A service contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties that outlines the terms and conditions of a service provided by one party to another.
2. ""käsundusleping"" vs. ""one-off contract""
	* Machine translation: The machine translation translates ""käsundusleping"" as ""lasting agreement,"" which is not an accurate translation. In English, a lasting agreement refers to an agreement that is in effect for an extended period of time, such as a long-term contract.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation translates ""käsundusleping"" as ""one-off contract,"" which is a more accurate translation. A one-off contract is a contract that is entered into for a specific purpose or project, and is not a long-term or ongoing agreement.
3. ""keskmine"" vs. ""one-off service""
	* Machine translation: The machine translation translates ""keskmine"" as ""provision of a one-off service,"" which is not an accurate translation. In English, ""provision"" refers to the act of providing or supplying something, while ""one-off service"" is a more common and accurate term for a service that is provided only once.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation translates ""keskmine"" as ""one-off service,"" which is a more accurate translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of the language used and the context of the sentence. The machine translation uses uncommon terms and phrasings, which can make it difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable translation of the Estonian sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""grouped around a common object"" while the reference translation uses ""words by people."" This difference in word choice may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as ""grouped around a common object"" implies a more physical or spatial arrangement, while ""words by people"" is more general and could refer to any type of communication.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is one of the central and essential human activities"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was one of the central and essential human activities""). This difference in verb tense may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, as the present tense implies that the activity is ongoing or continuous, while the past tense implies that it was important in the past but may not be as relevant now.
3. Word order: The machine translation places the phrase ""common object"" after the verb ""use,"" while the reference translation places it before the verb. This difference in word order may affect the emphasis of the sentence, as the reference translation places more emphasis on the object being used.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""inimeste sõnakasutamine,"" which is an Estonian idiomatic expression that can be translated as ""use of people."" The reference translation does not use this idiomatic expression and instead uses the more general phrase ""words by people."" This difference in idiomatic expressions may affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the translation.

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""kauplesid"" to translate the English phrase ""trading with overseas countries"". While ""kauplesid"" can indeed mean ""traders"" in Estonian, it's not the most idiomatic or natural way to translate the English phrase. The reference translation uses a more literal translation of the English phrase, which is more accurate and easier to understand.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Minose kultuuri esindajad olid valdavalt kaupmehed""
	* Reference translation: ""The representatives of Minoan culture were mostly traders who were trading with overseas countries""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian word order, which is different from the English original. In Estonian, the subject ""Minose kultuuri"" comes before the verb ""esindajad"", whereas in English, the subject ""representatives of Minoan culture"" comes after the verb ""were"". The reference translation maintains the word order of the English original, which is more natural and easier to understand.
3. Idioms and expressions:

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""olid"", which can indeed mean ""were"" in some contexts, but it's not the most idiomatic or natural way to translate the English phrase ""were trading"". The reference translation uses the more common and natural English phrase ""were trading"", which is more accurate and easier to understand.
4. Style and tone:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""rebel"" instead of ""rebellion"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. In the reference translation, ""rebellion"" implies a more widespread and organized resistance, while ""rebel"" refers to an individual who is resisting authority.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""came"" instead of the past tense ""came"" in the reference translation. This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame of the action being described. The reference translation uses the past tense to indicate that the event occurred in the past, while the machine translation suggests that the action is ongoing.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""kogudusest välja heita"" in the reference translation. This expression is specific to Estonian and means ""from the congregation."" The machine translation does not capture the nuance of this expression, which is important for conveying the intended meaning of the sentence.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""who were still rebel"" comes after ""came to England,"" while in the reference translation, ""all those who were still rebellious"" comes before ""came to England."" This difference in word order can affect the emphasis and structure of the sentence.
5. Fluency: The machine translation is less fluent than the reference translation. The reference translation uses more complex and nuanced language, such as ""congregation"" and ""rebellious,"" which are more appropriate for a formal translation. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses simpler language, such as ""rebel,"" which may not convey the same level of nuance and complexity.

Overall, the machine translation is less accurate and less fluent than the reference translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""My pain"" (singular) vs. Reference translation: ""My pain, or some other of my mental states"" (plural)
	* Machine translation: ""vaimuseisundit"" (singular) vs. Reference translation: ""mental states"" (plural)
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""saan vaadelda"" (passive voice) vs. Reference translation: ""can only be observed"" (active voice)
	* Machine translation: ""ainult mina ise"" (singular) vs. Reference translation: ""I am directly aware of this"" (singular)
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""vahetult teadlik"" (literally ""can be seen clearly"") vs. Reference translation: ""directly aware of this"" (a more idiomatic way of expressing the idea)
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Oma valu või mõnd muud"" (subject-object-verb) vs. Reference translation: ""My pain, or some other of my mental states"" (subject-object-verb)
5. Tone:
	* Machine translation: ""saan vaadelda"" (passive voice) gives a more detached tone, while ""I am directly aware of this"" gives a more personal and introspective tone

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and tone. While the machine translation captures some of the basic meaning of the original sentence, it does not fully convey the nuances of the Estonian language. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation that better conveys the intended meaning of the original sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""the majority of the city"" are placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, they are placed at the end.
2. Use of prepositions: The machine translation uses the preposition ""in"" instead of ""on"" to indicate the location of the city. In the reference translation, the preposition ""on"" is used consistently throughout the sentence.
3. Use of articles: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""River Pahra,"" while the reference translation uses the indefinite article ""a.""
4. Use of adjectives: The machine translation uses the adjective ""right"" to describe the location of the city, while the reference translation uses the adjective ""right bank.""
5. Use of verb tenses: The machine translation uses the present tense for the verb ""is,"" while the reference translation uses the past tense ""was.""
6. Use of passive voice: The machine translation uses the passive voice in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the active voice.
7. Use of idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""paremal kaldal,"" which is used in the reference translation to indicate the location of the city.
8. Use of word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""tractor"" to translate the Estonian word ""magistraalist,"" which may not be the most accurate choice. The reference translation uses the word ""railway line"" to provide a more accurate translation.

Based on these differences, it appears that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the original Estonian sentence. The machine translation makes several errors in word order, preposition usage, and word choice, which can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""For the first time in ten years there was peace across Europe."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""For the first time in ten years there was peace across Europe."" (correct)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense, which is ""was"" instead of ""was peace"".
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kogu Euroopas rahu"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""across Europe"" (correct)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""kogu Euroopas rahu"" which means ""the whole of Europe"" instead of the more common English phrase ""across Europe"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Esmakordselt kümne aasta jooksul"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""For the first time in ten years"" (correct)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a literal translation of the Estonian phrase ""Esmakordselt kümne aasta jooksul"" which means ""For the first time in ten years"" instead of the more common English idiomatic expression ""For the first time in ten years"".
4. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The translation seems a bit stilted and unnatural, which is a common issue with machine translations.
	* Reference translation: The translation flows smoothly and naturally, which is a hallmark of a good reference translation.
	* Difference: The machine translation lacks the natural flow and fluency of the reference translation.

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a score of 2 out of 5 and the reference translation a score of 4 out of 5. The reference translation is more accurate, natural, and idiomatic, while the machine translation has some grammatical errors and lacks fluency.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kuberneri kandidaadiks"" (candidate governor)
	* Reference translation: ""kohusetäitja"" (former Acting Governor)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""candidate"" to translate ""kandidaadik"", which is not the most accurate choice in this context. The reference translation uses ""former Acting Governor"" to provide a more precise translation.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Marin Kovtuni nimetas Murmanski oblasti kuberneri kandidaadiks"" (Marin Kovtuni has been nominated as the Governor's director)
	* Reference translation: ""Marin Kovtuni nimetas Murmanski oblasti kohusetäitja"" (Marin Kovtuni has been nominated as the Governor)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb ""nominated"" in the wrong tense. It should be in the past tense to match the time frame of the sentence. The reference translation uses the correct tense.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Dmitri Medvedev nimetas Marin Kovtuni kuberneri kandidaadiks"" (Dmitri Medvedev nominated Marin Kovtuni as the Governor's director)
	* Reference translation: ""Dmitri Medvedev nimetas Marin Kovtuni kohusetäitja"" (Dmitri Medvedev nominated Marin Kovtuni as the Governor)
	* Difference: The machine translation changes the word order, placing ""Dmitri Medvedev"" before ""Marin Kovtuni"" instead of after it. This is not the correct word order in Estonian.
4. Phrase structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Venemaa president Dmitri Medvedev nimetas Murmanski oblasti kuberneri kandidaadiks senise kuberneri kohusetäitja Marin Kovtuni"" (The President of Russia Dmitri Medvedev nominated the Governor of Murmanski Oblast as the current governor's director)
	* Reference translation: ""Venemaa president Dmitri Medvedev nimetas Murmanski oblasti kohusetäitja Marin Kovtuni"" (The President of Russia Dmitri Medvedev nominated Marin Kovtuni as the Governor)
	* Difference: The machine translation adds unnecessary phrases, such as ""senise kuberneri kohusetäitja"", which are not present in the reference translation.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not of high quality. The reference translation provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Estonian sentence.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural as the reference translation. The machine translation uses some words and phrases that are not commonly used in English, such as ""burial one"" and ""not a burial one"", which can make the translation sound awkward or unnatural. Additionally, the machine translation omits the article ""the"" before ""world"", which can also affect the meaning of the sentence.

Overall, while the machine translation may be able to generate some basic phrases and sentences, it is not yet advanced enough to produce high-quality translations that are both accurate and natural-sounding. A human translator would be able to produce a more accurate and natural translation of the original Estonian text.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Mr Valdemar also waited for Mr Ludford's help""
	* Reference translation: ""In return Valdemar also expected Ludwig 's help""

The machine translation uses the word ""waited"" to indicate that Valdemar was waiting for Ludford's help, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""expected Ludwig 's help"" to convey a more nuanced meaning. The reference translation suggests that Valdemar was expecting Ludford's help as a favor or an obligation, rather than simply waiting for it.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""tõusmiseks"" (genitive case)
	* Reference translation: ""ascending to the Danish throne""

The machine translation uses the Estonian genitive case ""tõusmiseks"" to indicate the object of the verb ""waited"", while the reference translation uses the English phrase ""ascending to the Danish throne"" to convey the same meaning. The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""tõusmiseks"" (genitive case)
	* Reference translation: ""ascending to the Danish throne""

As mentioned earlier, the machine translation uses the Estonian genitive case ""tõusmiseks"" to indicate the object of the verb ""waited"", while the reference translation uses the English phrase ""ascending to the Danish throne"" to convey the same meaning. The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English.

4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Mr Valdemar also waited for Mr Ludford's help in getting to the Danish thrall.""
	* Reference translation: ""In return Valdemar also expected Ludwig 's help in ascending to the Danish throne.""

The machine translation and the reference translation have different sentence structures. The machine translation uses a more straightforward sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with a subordinate clause. The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Estonian sentence better, and is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English.

	* Reference translation: ""Not only was he the first prisoner to be a prisoner of the Tower, but he was also the first to escape the Tower.""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""prisoner of mine"" instead of ""prisoner of the Tower"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall meaning of the sentence slightly.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Ta ka esimene Towerist põgeneja.""
	* Reference translation: ""He was the first to escape the Tower.""

The machine translation uses the genitive case ""Ta ka esimene Towerist põgeneja"" instead of the active voice ""He was the first to escape the Tower"" in the reference translation. This may affect the sentence structure and the emphasis of the sentence.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Ta ka esimene Towerist põgeneja.""
	* Reference translation: ""He was the first to escape the Tower.""

The machine translation does not include the idiomatic expression ""Ta ka esimene Towerist põgeneja"" in the reference translation, which may affect the naturalness and fluency of the sentence.

4. Word order:

	* Reference translation: ""Not only was he the first to escape the Tower, but he was also the first prisoner to be a prisoner of the Tower.""

The machine translation reverses the word order of the reference translation, which may affect the emphasis and the overall meaning of the sentence.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""local"" twice, while the reference translation uses it only once. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and flow of the translation.
2. Specificity: The machine translation uses the phrase ""other natural materials,"" which is more general than the reference translation's ""wood."" The reference translation provides more specific information about the type of material being used.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""use"") throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the present continuous tense (""use""). This difference in verb tense is minor, but it can affect the overall tone and style of the translation.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""looduslikke materjale"" (natural materials). This difference can affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the translation.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation accurately translates the Estonian word ""meistreid"" as ""masters,"" but it does not accurately translate the word ""kohalikku"" as ""local."" The reference translation accurately translates ""kohalikku"" as ""local.""

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""colours"" instead of ""dyes"". While ""colours"" is a valid translation of the Estonian word ""värv"", it is not the most idiomatic choice in this context. In English, ""dyes"" is the more common term used to refer to small quantities of colored substances used for coloring materials.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""were used"" instead of the past tense ""were built"". This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference translation uses the past tense ""were built"" to indicate that the ship Vasa was built in the shipyards, rather than the dyes being used in the shipyards.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the Estonian sentence. In Estonian, the sentence is structured as ""pisiSelliseid värvipigmente kasutati laevatöökodades, kus Vasa ehitati"", which means ""The dyes were used in the shipyards where Vasa was built"". In the machine translation, the sentence is structured as ""These tiny colours were used in the shipyards where the Left was built"". This can make the sentence sound less natural and less idiomatic in English.
4. Names: The machine translation uses the term ""Left"" instead of ""Vasa"". This is a significant error, as ""Vasa"" is the name of a famous ship that was built in the shipyards in question. Using the term ""Left"" instead of ""Vasa"" can make the sentence sound less accurate and less informative.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or idiomatic as the reference translation.

1. Grammar and syntax:
The machine translation has a grammatical error in the second sentence, where the verb ""should have known"" is in the wrong tense. The reference translation correctly uses the present tense ""may be said"" to maintain the same grammatical structure as the source text.
2. Vocabulary:
The machine translation uses the phrase ""it may have been said"" instead of the more idiomatic ""it may be said"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""seda ta oleks pidanud teadma"" in the source text, which means ""he should have known that"". The reference translation uses the more common English idiom ""he should have known better"".
4. Cultural references:
The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the source text, which is a common criticism of machine translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the more common English phrase ""he should have known that"" to convey the same meaning.
5. Fluency and naturalness:

Machine Translation:

* ""Säilinud on väga vähe Teise tsaaririigi ilmalikku kunsti.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Very little has been preserved in the secular art of the Second Empire.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""säilinud"" which means ""preserved"" in Estonian, while the reference translation uses ""preserved"" directly.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the Estonian grammar structure ""on + verb + infinitive"" to convey the idea of preserving, while the reference translation uses the English grammar structure ""has been preserved"" to convey the same idea.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the Estonian idiomatic expression ""Teise tsaaririigi ilmalikku kunsti"" which means ""the secular art of the other federal state"", while the reference translation uses the more common English idiomatic expression ""Second Empire"".
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation, with the verb ""säilinud"" appearing in the second position in the machine translation, while it appears in the third position in the reference translation.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation seems to be less accurate than the reference translation, as it uses the word ""säilinud"" which may not be familiar to English speakers, and also uses the idiomatic expression ""Teise tsaaririigi ilmalikku kunsti"" which may not be commonly used in English.

Overall, the machine translation seems to be less accurate and less fluent than the reference translation, and may not be suitable for formal or professional use.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""new instruments""
	* Reference translation: ""new tools""

The machine translation uses the term ""instruments"" instead of ""tools"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. ""Instruments"" can refer to a broader range of things, including musical instruments, while ""tools"" is more general and can refer to any type of equipment or device.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""when there is a need to do so""
	* Reference translation: ""when there is a need to do so""

Both translations use the same grammatical structure, but the machine translation uses a more formal and literal translation of the Estonian sentence. In Estonian, the sentence is in the present tense, while the machine translation uses the present continuous tense. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall flow and readability of the translation.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""mobilised""
	* Reference translation: ""adopted""

The machine translation uses the term ""mobilised"", which is a more formal and technical term that may not be immediately familiar to English speakers. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic term ""adopted"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall readability and naturalness of the translation.

4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""like industry""
	* Reference translation: ""like in industry""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""like industry"", which may not be immediately familiar to English speakers. The reference translation uses the phrase ""like in industry"", which is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English.

Overall, the machine translation is generally accurate, but there are some minor differences in word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. The reference translation is more natural-sounding and idiomatic, but it may not be as accurate in terms of word choice and grammar.

1. Source: ""valgus on elava vee allikas, valgus, mis on täis puhtust""
Machine Translation: ""This protein is a source of living water, protein full of purity.""
Reference Translation: ""This light is a source of living water, light full of purity.""

Differences:

* The source text uses the word ""valgus"" which means ""light"" in English, while the machine translation uses ""protein"".
* The machine translation adds the word ""full of purity"" to the end of the sentence, which is not present in the source or reference translations.
* The reference translation uses the word ""light"" instead of ""protein"" to match the source text.

Quality Evaluation:

Based on the differences above, the quality of the machine translation is relatively low. Here's why:

* The machine translation changed the meaning of the source text by using the word ""protein"" instead of ""light"". This is a significant error, as the meaning of the sentence changes entirely.
* The addition of the phrase ""full of purity"" is not present in the source or reference translations, and it does not make sense in the context of the sentence. This is an example of a grammatical error.

Overall, the machine translation is not a good representation of the original Estonian text. The reference translation, on the other hand, is a more accurate representation of the source text.

	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the more specific preposition ""to Tel Aviv's nursing hospital"" to provide more context and clarity.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation reverses the word order of the sentence, placing ""Ariel Sharon"" before ""who is in attendance"".

Step 1: Reading the Source Text
I have read the source text ""Georg ja Evelin seavad end poolenisti Mornasse sisse.""

Step 2: Analyzing the Machine Translation
I have analyzed the machine translation of the source text, which is ""Georg and Evelin are putting themselves in semi-Nazi.""

Comparison:

* The machine translation uses the term ""semi-Nazi,"" which is not a correct or appropriate term to use in this context. The correct term to use would be ""half-settle"" or ""settling in.""
* The machine translation also changes the meaning of the sentence by using the term ""putting themselves in,"" which is not what the original Estonian sentence intends to convey.

Step 3: Analyzing the Reference Translation
I have analyzed the reference translation of the source text, which is ""Georg and Evelin half-settle in Morna.""

Comparison:

* The reference translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Estonian sentence, which is to move or settle in a place.
* The reference translation uses the correct term ""half-settle,"" which is a more appropriate term to use in this context than the machine translation's ""putting themselves in.""

Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the reference translation is more accurate and better conveys the meaning of the original Estonian sentence than the machine translation. The machine translation makes significant errors in both the term used and the meaning of the sentence, which results in a poor quality translation.

While ""apparatus"" can refer to a system or device, it may not be the most appropriate choice in this context, as ""government"" is a more common and natural term to use when referring to the organization of a country or state.
2. Tense consistency: The machine translation uses the present tense (""He reformed"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""He reformed""). This inconsistency in tense can make the translation sound less natural and may cause confusion for the reader.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the verb ""began"" after the noun ""fight"" in the sentence, while the reference translation places it before the noun. In general, the word order in Estonian is different from English, and the reference translation follows the more common Estonian word order.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""begin the fight"" to convey the idea of starting a campaign or initiative against corruption.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the singular form of the verb ""reform"" in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the plural form ""reformed"". This may be due to a mistake in the machine translation, as the verb ""reform"" is usually used in the singular form in English.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""millele tuleb teistmoodi läheneda."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""needs to be approached differently."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the word ""tuleb"" which means ""will come"" in Estonian, but the correct translation for ""needs to be approached"" is ""needs to be"".

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Aga tundub, et on üks huvitav juhtum, millele tuleb teistmoodi läheneda."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""However, it seems that there is an interesting case that needs to be approached differently."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the phrase ""huvitav juhtum"" which means ""interesting case"" in Estonian, but the correct translation for ""interesting case"" is ""interesting situation"".

4. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: ""Aga tundub, et on üks huvitav juhtum, millele tuleb teistmoodi läheneda."" (inconsistent)
	* Reference translation: ""However, it seems that there is an interesting case that needs to be approached differently."" (consistent)

The machine translation is inconsistent in its use of language, sometimes using correct grammar and syntax, but other times using incorrect words or phrasing. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more consistent in its use of language, with correct grammar, syntax, and word choice.

Overall, the machine translation is not of high quality, as it contains several errors in grammar, syntax, word choice, and idiomatic expressions. The reference translation, on the other hand, is of high quality, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the original Estonian sentence while using correct language.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""official residence"" instead of ""somewhere else"" in the reference translation. This is a more formal and technical term, which may not be the best choice for this context.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are thought to live"") instead of the past tense (""were thought to live"") in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""kelle ametlik elukoht"" in the reference translation. This expression is commonly used in Estonian to refer to a person's official residence, and it is not directly translatable to English.
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""in Tallinn"" comes before the verb ""are thought to live"", while in the reference translation, the verb comes first. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity of the sentence.
5. Fluency: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The sentence structure and word choice in the machine translation can make it harder to understand for non-native speakers.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and uses more appropriate language for the context, while the machine translation uses more formal and technical language that may not be as clear or natural-sounding for non-native speakers.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""inheritance of the people""
	* Reference translation: ""folk legends""

The machine translation uses the term ""inheritance of the people"" to translate ""rahvapärimuse järgi"", which means ""foundations of an old monastery"". However, this phrase is not a common way to refer to the origins of a building in English. A more appropriate translation would be ""folk legends"", which better conveys the idea of traditional stories and beliefs surrounding the building's origins.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""It was built on the foundations of an 'old monastery' by the inheritance of the people.""
	* Reference translation: ""According to folk legends , it was built on the 'foundations of an old monastery'.""

The machine translation uses a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. The machine translation places the adjective ""old"" before the noun ""monastery"", while the reference translation places it after the noun. Additionally, the machine translation uses the verb ""built"" in the past tense, while the reference translation uses the present tense.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""by the inheritance of the people""
	* Reference translation: ""according to folk legends""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""by the inheritance of the people"" to translate ""rahvapärimuse järgi"", which is an idiomatic expression in Estonian. A more idiomatic translation in English would be ""according to folk legends"", which better conveys the idea of traditional stories and beliefs surrounding the building's origins.

4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""It was built on the foundations of an 'old monastery' by the inheritance of the people.""
	* Reference translation: ""According to folk legends , it was built on the 'foundations of an old monastery'.""

The machine translation and the reference translation have different word orders. The machine translation places the adjective ""old"" before the noun ""monastery"", while the reference translation places it after the noun.

5. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""inheritance of the people""
	* Reference translation: ""folk legends""

The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the phrase ""rahvapärimuse järgi"", which is a specific term in Estonian that refers to traditional stories and beliefs surrounding the origins of a building. A more culturally sensitive translation would be ""folk legends"", which better conveys the idea of traditional stories and beliefs surrounding the building's origins.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have different strengths and weaknesses. While the machine translation provides a clear and grammatically correct translation of the Estonian phrase, it does not capture the cultural context and idiomatic expressions of the original text. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more idiomatic and culturally sensitive translation, but may not be as clear or grammatically correct.

Machine Translation: ""Immediately after the painful loss, Mahler became aware of his lack of conscience.""

Reference Translation: ""Immediately after the painful loss, Mahler was informed of his heart failure.""

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""lack of conscience"" instead of ""heart failure"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""lack of conscience"" is not a direct equivalent of ""heart failure"" in Estonian.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""became aware"" instead of the past tense ""was informed"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use any idiomatic expressions in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""südamepuudulikkusest"" (heart failure). This is a significant difference, as idiomatic expressions are important for conveying the intended meaning in a language.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Estonian sentence. The reference translation more accurately conveys the meaning of the sentence by using the term ""heart failure"" instead of ""lack of conscience.""

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the original Estonian sentence. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text and better captures the nuances of the Estonian language.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in word choice, grammar, phraseology, and spelling, which can affect the overall quality of the translation.

To improve the quality of the machine translation, the following changes could be made:

1. Use a more accurate dictionary to ensure that the words used are correct and appropriate.
2. Improve the grammar and sentence structure to make the translation more natural and fluent.
3. Use more idiomatic expressions to make the translation sound more natural and native-like.

	* Machine translation: ""Bangladeshis toimusid kokkupõrked politsei ja opositsiooni toetajate vahel""
	* Reference translation: ""In Bangladesh there were clashes between police and opposition supporters trying to attack the government building.""

The machine translation uses the plural form of the noun ""Bangladeshis"" instead of the singular form ""Bangladesh"". Additionally, the word order in the machine translation is different, with ""toimusid"" (meaning ""were"") coming after the noun ""kokkupõrked"" (meaning ""clashes"") instead of before it.

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""kes üritasid rünnata valitsushoonet""
	* Reference translation: ""trying to attack the government building.""

The machine translation uses the word ""rünnata"" (meaning ""attack"") instead of the more common word ""attack"" in the reference translation. Additionally, the machine translation uses the word ""valitsushoonet"" (meaning ""government building"") instead of the more common phrase ""government building"".

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""toimusid kokkupõrked politsei ja opositsiooni toetajate vahel""
	* Reference translation: ""In Bangladesh there were clashes between police and opposition supporters trying to attack the government building.""

The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""clashes between police and opposition supporters"" in the same way as the reference translation. The machine translation simply translates each word separately, resulting in a less natural-sounding sentence.

4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""Bangladeshis toimusid kokkupõrked politsei ja opositsiooni toetajate vahel""
	* Reference translation: ""In Bangladesh there were clashes between police and opposition supporters trying to attack the government building.""

The machine translation does not take into account cultural differences between Bangladesh and Estonia, and therefore does not capture the nuances of the original sentence. For example, the reference translation uses the phrase ""opposition supporters"" to refer to the opposing group, which is a more common term in English than the machine translation's use of ""opposition supporters"".

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation differ significantly in terms of grammar, vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. The reference translation is more natural-sounding and captures the nuances of the original sentence better than the machine translation.

2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""arrived"" (MT) vs. ""arrived"" (Ref)

1. Deployment location: The machine translation says ""urban areas"" while the reference translation says ""strongholds"". This is a significant difference, as ""urban areas"" could refer to any populated area, while ""strongholds"" specifically refers to fortified locations.

2. Gift and property given: The machine translation says ""gifts and property taken from the Germans"" while the reference translation says ""gifts and property taken from the Germans"". This is a minor difference, but the reference translation is more accurate in this case, as the word ""taken"" implies that the gifts and property were taken from the Germans without their consent, which may not be the case.
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""paigutati"" which means ""sent"" or ""deployed"", while the reference translation uses the word ""jagati"" which means ""sent"" or ""deployed"".

4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the verb ""were given"" in the past tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""were given"" in the present tense. This is a minor difference, but the reference translation is more accurate in this case, as the sentence is describing a past event.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and precise than the machine translation in this case. The reference translation uses more formal and literary language, and it is more specific in its descriptions of the deployment location and the gifts and property given. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses more informal language and makes some minor errors in word choice and grammar.

2. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""poster agreement"" in the source text, while the reference translation does not use any article.
3. Number agreement: The machine translation agrees with the number of the noun ""agreement"" in the source text, while the reference translation uses the singular form ""deal"" instead of the plural form ""deals"".
4. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense ""signs"" instead of the past tense ""signed"" in the source text.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""uue"" instead of ""new"" in the source text.
6. Punctuation: The machine translation has a different punctuation than the reference translation. The machine translation has a period after ""Sonyi"" while the reference translation has a comma after ""Sony"".
7. Grammar: The machine translation has a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a passive voice construction, while the reference translation uses an active voice construction.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text, using the correct word order, verb tense, and word choice.

6. Idiomaticity:
	* Machine translation: ""hoone osaliselt kokku"" (which caused the building to partially collapsed) vs. Reference translation: ""caused the building to partially collapse"" (this is a more idiomatic way of expressing the idea in English)

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation. The machine translation uses some words and phrases that are not commonly used in English, such as ""cortermajas"" and ""tõttu"", and it also struggles with the idiomatic expressions, using a less natural phrase such as ""partially collapsed"". Additionally, the machine translation uses more formal language than the reference translation, which is more informal and conversational.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate, fluent, and idiomatic than the machine translation.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""practically"" twice, while the reference translation uses it only once. This may not be a significant difference, but it could affect the overall fluency and naturalness of the translation.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is grown"") while the reference translation uses the present continuous tense (""is grown in practically all small households""). This difference may not be significant, but it could affect the overall flow and rhythm of the translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation uses the phrase ""kasvatatakse praktiliselt kõigis väikemajapidamistes"", which is an idiomatic expression in Estonian. The reference translation does not use an equivalent idiomatic expression, instead using the more literal translation ""is grown in practically all small households"". While both translations are grammatically correct, the idiomatic expression in the reference translation may sound more natural and fluent to a native English speaker.
4. Word order: The machine translation uses a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""põhitoidus ja seda kasvatatakse"" comes before the verb ""is grown"", while in the reference translation, the verb ""is grown"" comes before the phrase ""põhitoidus ja seda"". This difference may not be significant, but it could affect the overall clarity and readability of the translation.
5. Cultural references: The machine translation uses the term ""small households"", which may not be the most culturally appropriate term for all English-speaking readers. In some cultures, the term ""family households"" or ""residential households"" may be more commonly used.

Overall, while both translations are grammatically correct, the reference translation is more natural and fluent, and takes into account cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions that are important for a high-quality translation.

	* Machine translation: ""elu kogu"" (common life) is translated as ""ethical element"" in the machine translation. In the reference translation, it is translated as ""entire ethical content"".
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure in the machine translation is different from the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more simplified sentence structure, with the verb ""is"" placed at the end of the sentence. In contrast, the reference translation maintains the original sentence structure of the Estonian sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""skemaatilist koodeksit"" (schematic code) in the same way as the reference translation. In the machine translation, it is translated as ""such a sceptic code"", which does not convey the same meaning.
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the Estonian sentence. For example, the reference translation uses the phrase ""common life"" to convey the idea of a shared social context, which may not be immediately clear to non-Estonian speakers.
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not flow as smoothly as the reference translation. The sentence structure and word choice in the machine translation can make it harder to understand for non-native speakers.

Overall, the machine translation falls short in capturing the nuances of the Estonian sentence, particularly in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. The reference translation provides a more accurate and fluent translation of the original Estonian sentence.

* ""The three points with Rwanda and Tanzania will be determined by the flows of the Mwibu and the Kagera River.""

Reference Translation:

* ""The triple point with Rwanda and Tanzania is determined by the flow beds of the Mwibu and the Kagera rivers.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the phrase ""flows of"" to translate the Estonian word ""määravad,"" while the reference translation uses ""flow beds of."" The choice of phrase depends on the context and the intended meaning, but in this case, the reference translation is more accurate as ""flow beds"" is a more precise term to describe the surface of a river where the water flows.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""will be determined"" to translate the Estonian verb ""määravad,"" while the reference translation uses the past tense ""is determined."" This is a minor difference, but the reference translation is more accurate as the triple point is already determined and not something that will happen in the future.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the prepositional phrase ""with Rwanda and Tanzania"" after the verb ""will be determined,"" while the reference translation places it before the verb. The word order is not crucial in this sentence, but the reference translation follows the typical word order in Estonian.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation is not entirely accurate in its translation of the Estonian phrase. The phrase ""mwibu ja Kagera jõe"" refers to the beds of the Mwibu and Kagera rivers, not just the flows of these rivers. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the intended meaning of the Estonian phrase.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and precise than the machine translation in this case. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Estonian phrase better and is more faithful to the original meaning.

5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""siiani"" instead of ""several"" to describe the number of people shot. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and naturalness of the translation.
6. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include any punctuation at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation includes a period to indicate the end of the sentence.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural as the reference translation. The machine translation has some errors in word order, preposition usage, tense, and word choice, which can affect the overall quality of the translation. However, it's important to note that machine translation technology is constantly improving, and the quality of machine translations can vary depending on the source and the specific translation task.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Władysław loobus, pärast rahalist hüvitist, oma nõuetest Vene troonile."" (The sentence is in the present tense, but the verb ""hüvitist"" is in the accusative case instead of the nominative case, which is incorrect.)
	* Reference translation: ""Władysław gave up his claims to the Russian throne."" (The sentence is in the present tense and the verb ""gave up"" is in the correct nominative case.)
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Vene troonile"" (The machine translation uses the word ""Vene"" which means ""Russian"" in Estonian, but the correct word to use in this context is ""Russi valdakond"" which means ""Russian Empire"".)
	* Reference translation: ""the Russian throne."" (The reference translation uses the correct term ""Russian throne"" to refer to the throne of the Russian Empire.)
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""oma nõuetest"" (The machine translation uses the phrase ""oma nõuetest"" which means ""his own"" in Estonian, but the correct phrase to use in this context is ""his claims to the Russian throne"".)
	* Reference translation: ""his claims to the Russian throne."" (The reference translation uses the correct phrase to convey the meaning of the original sentence.)
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""Władysław loobus"" (The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Władysław"" to ""Władysławus"".)
	* Reference translation: ""Władysław gave up his claims to the Russian throne."" (The reference translation accurately translates the name ""Władysław"" and the phrase ""claims to the Russian throne"".)

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in grammar, word choice, and idiomatic expressions, which can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more accurate and reliable translation of the Estonian sentence.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Kui gripiviirus muutub antigeense nihke käigus"" (When the flu virus changes in the course of an antigentic shift)
	* Reference translation: ""When the flu virus mutates in the course of an antigentic shift""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""muutub"" (changes) instead of ""mutates"", which is the correct term in English.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""puudub suurel hulgas inimestel"" (a large number of people)
	* Reference translation: ""a large number of people""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""puudub"" (do not have) instead of ""a large number of"", which is a more idiomatic way to express the idea in English.
3. Tense consistency:
	* Machine translation: ""uut tüüpi viiruse vastu immuunsus"" (a new type of virus immunisation)
	* Reference translation: ""immunity against a new type of the virus""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the present tense ""uut"" (a new) instead of the past tense ""a new type of"" in the reference translation.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""antigeense nihke käigus"" (antigenic shift)
	* Reference translation: ""antigenic shift""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""antigeense nihke käigus"" instead of the standard English term ""antigenic shift"".
5. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""kui gripiviirus muutub antigeense nihke käigus, puudub suurel hulgas inimestel uut tüüpi viiruse vastu immuunsus""
	* Reference translation: ""When the flu virus mutates in the course of an antigentic shift, a large number of people do not have immunity against a new type of the virus""
	* Difference: The machine translation reverses the order of the clauses, placing the cause (the virus changing) before the effect (the lack of immunity).

Overall, the machine translation makes several errors in grammar, word choice, and idiomatic expressions, which can affect the clarity and accuracy of the translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more idiomatic and consistent in its use of English grammar and vocabulary.

		+ Machine translation uses the word ""mistõttu"" which means ""doubtful"" or ""uncertain"" in Estonian, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""happiness must be maximized"" which is a more common and natural way to express the idea in English.
2. Grammar:

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and tone and style. While the machine translation is more literal and accurate in some aspects, the reference translation is more natural and common in English. Therefore, I would give a score of 60-70% for the machine translation and 80-90% for the reference translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Barang"" (instead of ""Barnaul"") - This is a clear error, as ""Barnaul"" is the correct spelling of the city in Russian.
	* Reference translation: ""Alexei Navalny"" (correct) - The machine translation gets the name of the opposition leader correct.
2. Grammar:

	* Reference translation: ""opposition leader Alexei Navalny"" (correct) - The machine translation gets the grammatical structure of the sentence correct.
3. Punctuation:
	* Machine translation: No punctuation after ""Barang"" (instead of a period) - The machine translation does not include a period after ""Barang"", which is necessary to separate the two independent clauses in the sentence.
	* Reference translation: No punctuation errors - The reference translation does not have any punctuation errors.
4. Idiomatic expressions:

	* Reference translation: The reference translation includes a cultural reference to Milan, which is a city in Italy, by using the phrase ""in Milan"".
	* Difference: The machine translation does not include any cultural references, while the reference translation includes a specific cultural reference.
5. Fluency and naturalness:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not flow as naturally as the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation flows more naturally and has a more consistent sentence structure.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""On 12 August 1921, the People's Union was asked to resolve the issue.""
	* Reference translation: ""On 12 August 1921, the League of Nations was asked to resolve the issue.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the term ""People's Union"" instead of ""League of Nations"" to translate ""Rahvasteliidul"" in the source text.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""was asked"" (present tense)
	* Reference translation: ""was asked"" (present tense)
	* Difference: Both the machine translation and the reference translation use the present tense to translate the verb ""lahendada"" in the source text, which means ""to ask"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""issue"" (singular)
	* Reference translation: ""issue"" (singular)
	* Difference: Both the machine translation and the reference translation translate the Estonian word ""lahendus"" as ""issue"", but the reference translation is more idiomatic in this context, as ""lahendus"" typically refers to a specific problem or matter.
4. Names and organizations:
	* Machine translation: ""People's Union"" (no equivalent in Estonian)
	* Reference translation: ""League of Nations"" (the correct translation of ""Rahvasteliidul"" in this context)
	* Difference: The machine translation does not have an equivalent term in Estonian to translate ""Rahvasteliidul"", so it uses ""People's Union"", which is not a direct equivalent.
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure and word choice in the machine translation are not as fluent or natural-sounding as the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: The sentence structure and word choice in the reference translation are more fluent and natural-sounding, indicating a higher level of fluency.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation, and it demonstrates a better understanding of the context and nuances of the Estonian language.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Grammar and syntax:
The machine translation and reference translation have the same grammatical structure and syntax. Both sentences are in the active voice and use the same verb forms.
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
The machine translation uses the word ""placed"" instead of ""placing"" in the reference translation. While ""placed"" is a valid word in English, it doesn't quite convey the same meaning as ""placing"". The reference translation uses the more appropriate word in this context.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation doesn't quite capture the idiomatic expression ""süüdlasel on tunne"" in the reference translation. The phrase ""süüdlasel"" is a colloquialism that means ""to feel something"", and ""tunne"" is an adverb that means ""somewhere"". The reference translation uses more natural and idiomatic language.
4. Cultural references:
The machine translation doesn't take into account any cultural references or nuances in the Estonian sentence. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses language that is more appropriate for a English-speaking audience.
5. Fluency and naturalness:
The machine translation sounds less natural and less fluent than the reference translation. The reference translation flows better and is more idiomatic in English.

Based on these analyses, I would give the machine translation a lower rating than the reference translation. While the machine translation is grammatically correct, it doesn't capture the nuances of the Estonian language and sounds less natural in English.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given source:

1. Word order: The machine translation keeps the original word order of the source text, while the reference translation rearranges the words to better convey the meaning in English. For example, in the machine translation, ""Iisraeli peaminister"" is translated as ""Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel on 13 December 2006.""
2. Article usage: The machine translation omits the definite article ""the"" before ""Prime Minister,"" while the reference translation includes it. In the source text, the article is used, so the translation should also include it.
3. Date format: The machine translation uses the day-month-year format for the date, while the reference translation uses the month-day-year format. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the clarity of the translation.
4. Name translation: The machine translation translates ""Ehud Olmert"" as ""Ehud Olmert,"" while the reference translation translates it as ""Prime Minister Ehud Olmert."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the clarity of the translation.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""peaminister"" to translate ""prime minister,"" while the reference translation uses ""Prime Minister."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the clarity of the translation.
6. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense for the verb ""to be,"" while the reference translation uses the past tense. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the clarity of the translation.

Based on these differences, it seems that the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation takes into account the nuances of English grammar and word choice to produce a more natural-sounding translation. The machine translation, on the other hand, relies more on direct word-for-word translations, which can sometimes result in awkward or unnatural phrasing.

Overall, while the machine translation is adequate for basic communication, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic, and it is the better choice for formal or professional contexts.

2. Number agreement: In the machine translation, the phrase ""more than ten civilians"" is translated as ""ole kuus kümne tsiviilisiku."" However, in the reference translation, the phrase ""ten civilians were killed"" is used, which is more accurate.
3. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""are injured"") for the Estonian verb ""sai,"" which is in the past tense in the reference translation (""were injured"").
4. Word order: In the machine translation, the phrase ""in clashes"" is translated as ""Kokkupõrgetes hukkus seitse,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""In clashes, ten civilians were killed and more than ten were injured."" The word order is different in the two translations.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""ole kuus kümne tsiviilisiku"" (more than ten civilians), which is a common way to express a large number in Estonian.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Girkin kutsus üles relvarahu kehtestamisele humanitaarsetel kaalutlustel."" (Subject-verb-object-verb)
	* Reference translation: ""Girkin called for a cease-fire on humanitarian grounds."" (Subject-verb-object-verb)

The machine translation uses a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the subject ""Girkin"" is followed by the verb ""kutsus,"" which is in the infinitive form, and then the object ""relvarahu"" and the verb ""kehtestamisele."" In contrast, the reference translation uses the subject-verb-object-verb (SVO) structure, with ""Girkin"" as the subject, ""called"" as the verb, and ""on humanitarian grounds"" as the object.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""kehtestamisele"" (meaning ""on"")
	* Reference translation: ""on humanitarian grounds""

The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""kehtestamisele,"" which means ""on,"" while the reference translation uses the English phrase ""on humanitarian grounds.""

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""humanitaarsetel kaalutlustel"" (meaning ""humanitarian grounds"")
	* Reference translation: ""humanitarian grounds""

The machine translation uses a phrase that is not commonly used in English, ""humanitaarsetel kaalutlustel,"" which is a literal translation of the Estonian phrase ""humanitaarsetel kaalutlustel."" In contrast, the reference translation uses the more common English phrase ""humanitarian grounds.""

4. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: ""Girkin kutsus üles relvarahu kehtestamisele humanitaarsetel kaalutlustel."" (Sentence structure is awkward and unnatural)
	* Reference translation: ""Girkin called for a cease-fire on humanitarian grounds."" (Sentence structure is natural and fluent)

The machine translation has a more awkward and unnatural sentence structure than the reference translation, which flows more smoothly and naturally in English.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or fluent as the reference translation in conveying the intended meaning of the Estonian sentence. The machine translation uses different grammatical structures, word choices, and idiomatic expressions than the reference translation, which can make it more difficult for a native English speaker to understand the meaning of the sentence.

	* Reference translation: ""In a conflict situation, the more expected tactic would be to join with one side against the other, rather than attack both at the same time.""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""attacking both at the same time,"" while the reference translation uses ""attack both at the same time."" The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in Estonian, as ""attack"" is not a common verb in Estonian, and ""attack both at the same time"" is not a common phrase in Estonian.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Konfliktiolukorras oleks oodatavam taktika liituda ühe osapoolega teise vastu, mitte mõlemat korraga rünnata.""
	* Reference translation: ""In a conflict situation, the more expected tactic would be to join with one side against the other, rather than attack both at the same time.""

The machine translation uses the genitive case in ""Konfliktiolukorras oleks,"" while the reference translation uses the nominative case in ""In a conflict situation."" Additionally, the machine translation uses the verb ""mõlemat"" in the passive voice, while the reference translation uses the verb ""mitte"" in the active voice.

3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""In a conflict situation, it would be more desirable to join a tactic with one side against the other, rather than attacking both at the same time.""
	* Reference translation: ""In a conflict situation, the more expected tactic would be to join with one side against the other, rather than attack both at the same time.""

The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""attack both at the same time"" in Estonian, which is a common way to express the idea of attacking two people or things simultaneously. The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic expression ""attack both at the same time"" to convey the same meaning.

4. Fluency:

	* Reference translation: ""proposed"" instead of ""ettepaneku korraldada"" (the correct verb for ""proposed"")
3. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: The sentence is structured differently, with the phrase ""1245 aasta Lyoni kirikukogul"" (1245 in the Lyon Church) coming before the verb ""tegi"" (proposed)
	* Reference translation: The sentence is structured correctly, with the verb ""proposed"" coming after the phrase ""At the Church Council of Lyon in 1245""
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: There are no idiomatic expressions in the machine translation
	* Reference translation: The reference translation includes an idiomatic expression ""uus ristisõda"" (a new crusade) which is a common expression used to refer to a military campaign or expedition
5. Accuracy:

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation and the reference translation have different levels of quality. The machine translation seems to have made some errors in word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions, which can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation.

In particular, the machine translation uses more formal language than the reference translation, which may not be suitable for all contexts. For example, the phrase ""mere concepts"" is more formal than ""mere ideas,"" and ""kokkupuudet"" is not a commonly used term in English. Additionally, the machine translation uses the word ""vaid"" instead of ""but,"" which can change the tone of the sentence.

Overall, while the machine translation is not perfect, it can still be useful for getting the general meaning of the text. However, for more accurate and polished translations, it's best to use a reference translation or to consult with a professional translator.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source Text: Kant väidab, et siis me tajume neid alati ruumilisi omadusi omavatena.
2. Machine Translation: Kant claims that we will then always perceive them as having spatial characteristics.
3. Reference Translation: Kant claims that we will then always perceive them as having spatial characteristics.

Comparison:

The machine translation and reference translation are similar in that they both convey the same meaning of Kant's statement. However, there are some differences in the way the words are phrased and the sentence structure is organized.

Machine Translation:

* ""Kant claims that we will then always perceive them as having spatial characteristics."" - This translation uses more formal language and a more literal interpretation of the source text.
* ""Kant"" is capitalized, which is not necessary in Estonian.
* ""omadusi"" is translated as ""perceive them"" instead of ""perceive them as having spatial characteristics"".

Reference Translation:

* ""Kant claims that we will then always perceive them as having spatial characteristics."" - This translation uses more natural language and a more idiomatic interpretation of the source text.
* ""Kant"" is not capitalized, which is correct in Estonian.
* ""omavatena"" is translated as ""having spatial characteristics"" instead of ""perceive them"".

Conclusion:

Both the machine translation and reference translation convey the same meaning, but the machine translation uses more formal language and a more literal interpretation of the source text, while the reference translation uses more natural language and a more idiomatic interpretation. The reference translation is generally more accurate and idiomatic, but the machine translation is still understandable and conveys the main idea of Kant's statement.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Officials began to pay a higher salary to reduce the temptation of bribery."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Officials began to receive a higher salary to reduce the temptation of bribery."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense, which is ""pay"" instead of ""receive"". Additionally, the phrase ""to reduce the temptation of bribery"" is not grammatically correct in English.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""maksma suuremat palka"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""officials began to receive a higher salary"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the word ""suuremat"" which means ""higher"" in Estonian, but it is not the correct word choice in English. The reference translation uses the word ""salary"" which is the correct term in English.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""et vähendada altkäemaksu võtmise kiusatust"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""to reduce the temptation of bribery"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the phrase ""altkäemaksu võtmise kiusatust"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in English. The reference translation uses the phrase ""to reduce the temptation of bribery"" which is a more common and idiomatic way to express the idea in English.

4. Fluency and naturalness:
	* Machine translation: ""Ametnikele hakati maksma suuremat palka, et vähendada altkäemaksu võtmise kiusatust."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Officials began to receive a higher salary to reduce the temptation of bribery."" (correct)

The machine translation sounds less fluent and natural compared to the reference translation. The reference translation flows better and is more idiomatic in English.

Based on these differences, I would give the reference translation a higher quality score than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, uses more common and idiomatic expressions, and sounds more fluent and natural in English.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""oma armastavat pühendumist"" (own loving commitment) vs. Reference translation: ""omad armastatud pühendumist"" (own loved one)
4. Tone:
	* Machine translation: ""siis ei oleks see talle seesmiselt väärtuslik"" (it is not worthy of it internally) vs. Reference translation: ""siis ei oleks see talle seesmiselt väärtuslik"" (it is not worthy of it) - The machine translation sounds more formal and less emotive than the reference translation, which has a more personal tone.
5. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: ""instrumentaalselt"" (instrumentally) vs. Reference translation: ""liikmete tegevus"" (loving commitment) - The machine translation uses the word ""instrumentaalselt"", which is not commonly used in Estonian to describe a loving commitment. The reference translation uses the word ""liikmete tegevus"", which is more commonly used in Estonian to describe a romantic or sexual relationship.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation has some errors in word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions, and the tone is not as personal as the reference translation. The cultural nuances are also different between the two translations, with the machine translation using a word that is not commonly used in Estonian to describe a loving commitment. Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation.

Machine Translation:

* ""I have come to Georg to report good news and bad news.""

Reference Translation:

* ""Evelin comes to Georg to report good news and bad news.""

Differences:

1. Word order: The machine translation uses a more formal and literal word order, while the reference translation uses a more natural and conversational word order. In the reference translation, the subject ""Evelin"" comes before the verb ""comes"".
2. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""Georg"", while the reference translation does not use any article. In Estonian, the definite article is not always used when referring to a proper noun.
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""uudiseid"" (news) instead of ""teatama"" (tidings) in the reference translation. While both words can be translated as ""news"", ""teatama"" has a more archaic or literary connotation.
4. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include any punctuation after the verb ""report"", while the reference translation includes a period at the end of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is more literal and formal, while the reference translation is more natural and conversational. The differences in word order, article usage, word choice, and punctuation highlight some of the challenges of machine translation, particularly when dealing with idiomatic expressions or cultural nuances.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""mõtet rääkida"" (can speak)
	* Reference translation: ""might claim it makes sense to speak""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb ""mõtet"" (can) instead of ""might"" to convey the idea of possibility.
2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""aga vastamine pole tema"" (but answering is not within his competence)
	* Reference translation: ""but answering is not within his competence""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the present tense ""aga"" (but) instead of the past tense ""but"" used in the reference translation.
3. Domain-specific terminology:
	* Machine translation: ""füüsiku pädevuses"" (but within the competence of physics)
	* Reference translation: ""but within the competence of a physicist""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the term ""füüsiku pädevuses"" (physics) instead of ""physicist"" to convey the idea of a specific field of expertise.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""on mõtet rääkida küll"" (he might claim it makes sense to speak)
	* Reference translation: ""he might claim it makes sense to speak""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian idiomatic expression ""mõtet rääkida"" (to make sense to speak) instead of the more literal ""claim it makes sense to speak"" used in the reference translation.
5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Or he might claim it makes sense to speak, but answering is not within his competence, but within the competence of physics.""
	* Reference translation: ""Or he might claim it makes sense to speak, but answering is not within his competence, but within the competence of a physicist.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a longer sentence structure with multiple clauses, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with fewer clauses.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in terms of word choice, tense, domain-specific terminology, idiomatic expressions, and grammar. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic, while the machine translation is more straightforward and simple.

Machine Translation: ""In 1886, the Gabon site was added to the French Congo.""

Reference Translation: ""In 1886, the Gabon territory was added to the French Congo.""

The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""site"" instead of ""territory"". While ""site"" can be a valid translation of ""ala"" in some contexts, in this case, ""territory"" is a more appropriate choice because it better conveys the idea of a defined geographic area.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense ""was added"" instead of the past tense ""was added"". This is a common error in machine translation, as the algorithm may not always be able to accurately determine the tense of the source language.
3. Accuracy: The machine translation gets the location of Gabon wrong. Gabon is a country located in West Africa, not in French Congo.

Overall, the machine translation is not very accurate and lacks nuance compared to the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more precise and informative translation of the original Estonian sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation: ""Two bombardments took place in the Eastern Afghan city of Khowt.""

Reference Translation: ""Two bombings took place in the Eastern Afghan city of Khowst.""

The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""bombardments"" instead of ""bombings"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. ""Bombardment"" typically refers to a prolonged or repeated attack, while ""bombing"" refers to a single attack.
2. Accentuation: The reference translation places the stress on the second syllable of ""Khowst"", while the machine translation places the stress on the first syllable. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the rhythm and flow of the sentence.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the plural form of the verb ""took"" (i.e. ""took place"") instead of the singular form (i.e. ""took""). This is a more common way of expressing the idea in English, but it can make the sentence sound less formal or less precise.
4. Spelling: The machine translation spells the name of the city as ""Khowt"", while the reference translation spells it as ""Khowst"". This is a more common spelling for the city's name in English.

Overall, the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are relatively minor, but they can affect the clarity and accuracy of the sentence. The reference translation is generally more accurate and precise, but the machine translation is still passable for basic communication purposes.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""detainees"" (singular)
	* Reference translation: ""detainees"" (plural)

The machine translation uses the singular form ""detainees"" instead of the plural form ""detainees"". This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Police operation"" (singular)
	* Reference translation: ""Police operations"" (plural)

The machine translation uses the singular form ""Police operation"" instead of the plural form ""Police operations"". This is a more significant error, as it changes the overall meaning of the sentence. The reference translation is more accurate, as it reflects the plural nature of the noun ""Police operations"".

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""käigus sai surma"" (verb-object-subject)
	* Reference translation: ""surma sai käigus"" (subject-verb-object)

The machine translation places the verb ""sai"" (killed) after the object ""käigus"" (detainees), while the reference translation places the verb ""surma"" (killed) before the object ""käigus"". This is a more significant error, as it affects the overall structure of the sentence. The reference translation is more accurate, as it follows the typical word order in Estonian.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""7 kinnipeetavat"" (literal translation: ""7 prisoners killed"")
	* Reference translation: ""7 detainees were killed""

The machine translation uses the literal translation of ""kinnipeetavat"" (prisoners), which is not commonly used in English. The reference translation uses the more idiomatic expression ""detainees were killed"", which is more natural and accurate.

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a score of 60% and the reference translation a score of 90%. The machine translation has some minor errors in word choice and grammar, but it also uses a more literal translation of ""kinnipeetavat"" that is not commonly used in English. The reference translation, on the other hand, is more accurate and natural-sounding, with proper word order and idiomatic expressions.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my step-by-step analysis:

1. Source Text: Pols'i tantsitakse tavalise viiuli või lõõtspilli saatel.
Machine Translation: The Pols will be danced on the routine sign or on the loop cloud.
Reference Translation: Pols is danced with regular violin or accordion accompaniment.

Difference 1: Word order

The machine translation changes the word order of the source text. In the source text, ""Pols'i tantsitakse"" comes first, followed by ""tavalise viiuli või lõõtspilli saatel"". In the machine translation, ""The Pols will be danced"" comes first, followed by ""on the routine sign or on the loop cloud"".

Difference 2: ""Pols"" vs. ""Pols'i""

In the source text, the word ""Pols"" is singular, while in the machine translation, it becomes plural. The machine translation also changes the word ""tantsitakse"" to ""will be danced"", which is not the correct translation of the Estonian verb ""tantsitakse"".

Difference 3: ""viiiuli"" vs. ""viiuli""

In the source text, the word ""viiiuli"" is used, which is the correct spelling for the Estonian word for ""violin"". However, the machine translation changes it to ""viiuli"", which is an incorrect spelling.

Difference 4: ""saatel"" vs. ""accompaniment""

In the source text, the word ""saatel"" is used, which is the correct spelling for the Estonian word for ""accompaniment"". However, the machine translation changes it to ""loop cloud"", which is not a correct translation of the Estonian word.

Conclusion:

Based on the differences identified above, it is clear that the machine translation is not accurate. The word order is changed, the singular form of ""Pols"" is made plural, the spelling of ""viiuli"" is incorrect, and the translation of ""saatel"" is completely wrong. Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given source:

Machine Translation:

* ""miniatures"" is translated as ""miniatuurid"" in the machine translation, which is the correct Estonian word for the English term.
* ""Expresses"" is translated as ""väljendavad"" in the machine translation, which is a more literal translation of the English word, but it doesn't convey the same nuance of meaning. In English, ""expresses"" implies a more direct and explicit communication of ideas, while in Estonian, ""väljendavad"" can also convey a sense of subtlety or nuance.
* ""abstraction"" is translated as ""abstraktsust"" in the machine translation, which is a more literal translation of the English word. However, ""abstraction"" is a complex term that can have different connotations depending on the context, and in this case, it may not be the best choice to use the Estonian word ""abstraktsust"", which can also mean "" abstract"". A better translation might be ""abstraktsete"" or ""abstrakts"".
* ""symbolic significance"" is translated as ""sümboolsete"" in the machine translation, which is a more literal translation of the English phrase. However, ""sümboolsete"" is a rather formal and technical term in Estonian, and in this context, it may not be the best choice to use it. A more idiomatic Estonian phrase might be ""sümbolikse tähendust"".

Reference Translation:

* ""century"" is translated as ""sajand"" in the reference translation, which is the correct Estonian word for the English term.

Overall, the machine translation does a decent job of translating the source text into Estonian, but there are some areas where the translations could be improved. For example, the use of ""väljendavad"" instead of ""expresses"" may not convey the same nuance of meaning, and the use of ""abstraktsust"" instead of ""abstraktsete"" or ""abstrakts"" may not be the best choice in this context. Additionally, the use of ""sümboolsete"" instead of ""sümbolikse tähendust"" may not be the most idiomatic Estonian phrase in this context.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""It is looking to the future as we look at the past."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""He sees future in the same way as we see the past."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense in the second sentence, which makes it sound awkward and incorrect. The reference translation uses the correct verb tense to convey the intended meaning.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""tulevikku"" (future)
	* Reference translation: ""future"" (no change)

The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""tulevikku"" to translate the English word ""future"". While this word is correct, it's important to note that the reference translation uses the English word ""future"" directly, which is more idiomatic and easier to understand for English speakers.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""as we look at the past""
	* Reference translation: ""in the same way as we see the past""

The machine translation uses a literal translation of the Estonian phrase, which doesn't quite convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more idiomatic expression to convey the idea that the person is looking to the future with the same perspective as they see the past.

4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""It is looking to the future as we look at the past.""
	* Reference translation: ""He sees future in the same way as we see the past.""

The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more straightforward and simple sentence structure, while the machine translation uses a longer and more complex sentence with a subordinate clause.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. The reference translation conveys the intended meaning more clearly and uses more natural language structures, making it a better translation of the Estonian sentence.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation has some inaccuracies and inappropriate word choices compared to the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the word ""üle teostab"" instead of ""operates under"", which is not a common phrase in English. Additionally, the machine translation uses the word ""tégutseb"" instead of ""adopted"", which is also not a common phrase in English.

Overall, the machine translation seems to have some errors in word choice, grammar, and phraseology compared to the reference translation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.

Machine Translation:

* ""Siiski oli Sofia ema"" becomes ""Yet Sofia's mother"" in the machine translation. This is a common error in machine translation, as the word order in Estonian is different from English. In Estonian, the word ""Siiski"" is in the accusative case, while in English, it would be in the nominative case.
* ""Sofia ema"" becomes ""her mother"" in the machine translation. This is a correct translation, but it could be improved by using the more common phrase ""Sofia's mother"" instead.
* ""Hanna Salin"" becomes ""her mother"" in the machine translation. This is another correct translation, but again, the more common phrase ""Hanna Salin"" could be used.
* ""temaga väga rahul"" becomes ""was very pleased with her"" in the machine translation. This is a good translation, but it could be improved by using the more common phrase ""was very pleased with her mother"" instead.

Reference Translation:

* ""Siiski oli Sofia ema"" becomes ""Yet Sofia 's mother"" in the reference translation. This is a more accurate translation, as it preserves the word order in Estonian.
* ""Sofia ema"" becomes ""Sofia's mother"" in the reference translation. This is a more accurate translation, as it uses the more common phrase in English.
* ""Hanna Salin"" becomes ""Hanna Salin"" in the reference translation. This is a correct translation, as the name ""Hanna Salin"" is not changed in the reference translation.
* ""temaga väga rahul"" becomes ""was very pleased with her"" in the reference translation. This is a good translation, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the Estonian sentence.

Overall, the machine translation makes several errors in word order and phraseology, while the reference translation is more accurate in its translation of the Estonian sentence.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Esimest Cuddalore'i vastu saadetud"" (Source) vs. ""The first French Strait"" (Machine translation)
		+ The machine translation uses the term ""Strait"" instead of ""Cuddalore"", which is the correct term in the source text.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""üllatati"" (Source) vs. ""was surprised"" (Machine translation)
		+ The machine translation changes the verb tense from past tense (""üllatati"") to present tense (""was surprised"") in the source text.
3. Phrasing:
	* Machine translation: ""naabobi vägede"" (Source) vs. ""neighbouring troops"" (Machine translation)
		+ The machine translation changes the phrase ""naabobi vägede"" to ""neighbouring troops"", which is a more common way to express this idea in English.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""poolt detsembris 1746"" (Source) vs. ""in December 1746"" (Machine translation)
		+ The machine translation changes the word order in the source text, moving ""poolt detsembris"" to the end of the sentence instead of keeping it in the middle.
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""võideti seal lähedal"" (Source) vs. ""defeated there"" (Machine translation)

	* Reference translation: ""independent congregation""

The machine translation uses the term ""collection"" which is not the most accurate translation of the Estonian word ""kogudus"". The reference translation uses ""congregation"", which is a more appropriate term to describe a group of people who gather for religious purposes.

2. Tense:

Both translations use the same tense, which is correct.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""selle juurde iseseisev kogudus""
	* Reference translation: ""there an independent congregation was founded""

The machine translation changes the word order of the Estonian sentence, which can make it harder to understand. In the reference translation, the word order is closer to the original Estonian sentence.

4. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""remonditi ja asutati""
	* Reference translation: ""was repaired and founded""

The machine translation uses the verb ""remonditi"" which is not the most accurate translation of the Estonian verb ""remonditi"". The reference translation uses the verb ""was repaired and founded"", which is a more accurate translation of the Estonian verb ""asutati"".

5. Idiomatic expressions:

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Subsequently, the number of precipitation falls long"" - The sentence structure is incorrect, and ""falls long"" is not a grammatically correct phrase.
	* Reference translation: ""Subsequently, the volume of precipitation gradually decreases"" - This sentence is grammatically correct and uses the correct verb form.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""pikkamisi"" (precipitation) - This word is not commonly used in English, and the correct term is ""precipitation"".
	* Reference translation: ""precipitation"" - This is the correct term in English.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""and between May and September, it almost fell at all"" - This phrase is not idiomatic in English, and the correct phrase would be ""and between May and September, it almost doesn't rain at all"".
	* Reference translation: ""and between May and September, it almost does not rain at all"" - This is a more idiomatic and natural way to express the idea in English.
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""hulk"" (suddenly) - This word is not commonly used in English, and the correct term would be ""suddenly"".
	* Reference translation: ""suddenly"" - This is the correct term in English.
5. Fluency:
	* Machine translation: ""pikkamisi väheneb"" - This phrase is not a complete sentence in English, and the correct phrase would be ""the volume of precipitation decreases"".
	* Reference translation: ""the volume of precipitation gradually decreases"" - This sentence is more fluent and natural in English.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not of high quality. The reference translation is more accurate, idiomatic, and fluent in English. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further translation work.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""This is precisely the sort of metaphysical issue that the logical empirists were hoping to avoid when the explanation was analysed."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""This is precisely the sort of metaphysical issue that the logical empirists were hoping to avoid when the explanation was analysed."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong verb tense in the second sentence, which makes it sound awkward and unnatural. The reference translation preserves the correct tense and syntax.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""loogilised"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""logical"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""loogilised,"" which doesn't have a direct English equivalent. The reference translation uses the more common English word ""logical.""

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""seletuse analüüsimisel"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""in the analysis of the explanation"" (correct)

The machine translation uses a phrase that doesn't have a direct English equivalent, and the reference translation provides a more natural and idiomatic way to express the idea.

4. Meaning:
	* Machine translation: ""mida loogilised empiristid lootsid seletuse analüüsimisel vältida."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""the logical empirists were hoping to avoid when the explanation was analysed."" (correct)

The machine translation changes the meaning of the sentence slightly, implying that the logical empirists were trying to avoid something else entirely. The reference translation preserves the original meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is not very accurate, and it changes the meaning of the sentence in several places. The reference translation is more natural and preserves the original meaning of the Estonian sentence.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""Particular attention was given to Poland in the resolution, where the restriction of the rights of homosexuals has been supported at the level of speeches by government officials."" (incorrect use of ""where"" and ""has been"")
	* Reference translation: ""Particular attention was given to Poland in the resolution, where the restriction of the rights of homosexuals has been supported at the level of speeches by government officials."" (correct use of ""where"" and ""has been"")
2. Word choice and terminology:
	* Machine translation: ""homoseksuaalsete"" (Estonian) -> ""homosexuals"" (English)
	* Reference translation: ""homosexuals"" (English) -> ""homoseksuaalsete"" (Estonian)
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""toetatud valitsusametnike sõnavõttude tasandil"" (Estonian) -> ""supported at the level of speeches by government officials"" (incorrect use of ""level"")
	* Reference translation: ""toetatud valitsusametnike sõnavõttude tasandil"" (Estonian) -> ""supported at the level of speeches by government officials"" (correct use of ""level"")
4. Cultural and contextual nuances:
	* Machine translation: The phrase ""homoseksuaalsete inimeste õiguste piiramist"" (Estonian) can be translated as ""the rights of homosexuals"" in English, but it's important to note that the term ""homosexual"" is not always considered to be an appropriate or respectful term in modern English. A more inclusive term might be ""LGBTQ+ individuals"" or ""people who identify as LGBTQ+"".
	* Reference translation: ""homosexuals"" (English) -> ""homoseksuaalsete inimeste õiguste piiramist"" (Estonian)

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of grammar, word choice, idiomatic expressions, and cultural and contextual nuances. While the machine translation does get the general meaning of the sentence across, it contains several errors that can affect the overall quality of the translation.

2. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""government"" in the second sentence, while the reference translation does not use any article.
3. Pronoun agreement: In the machine translation, the pronoun ""his"" does not agree with the gender of the noun ""government"". In the reference translation, the pronoun ""his"" agrees with the gender of the noun ""government"".
4. Tense: The machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation is in the past tense.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""appointed"" instead of ""named"" or ""designated"" in the second sentence.
6. Phrase structure: The machine translation uses a longer phrase structure than the reference translation. For example, in the machine translation, ""President of Finland"" is a single phrase, while in the reference translation, it is broken down into two phrases: ""President of"" and ""Finland"".
7. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""uue valitsuse"" (new government) in the second sentence, while the reference translation does.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has made several errors in word order, article usage, pronoun agreement, tense, word choice, and phrase structure. Additionally, it has missed the opportunity to use an idiomatic expression that is commonly used in Estonian.

	* Reference translation: ""in accordance with the motive."" (The word choice is correct in English.)
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Doing so can be described as good or bad in accordance with the motive."" (The idiomatic expression ""doing so"" is not used in Estonian, and the phrase ""good or bad"" is not grammatically correct in Estonian.)
	* Reference translation: ""Acts can be described as good or bad."" (The idiomatic expression ""acts can be described"" is correct in English.)
4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""headeks või halbadeks"" (The phrase ""headeks või halbadeks"" is a colloquial expression in Estonian, but it is not commonly used in formal writing or in translation.)
	* Reference translation: ""good or bad."" (The phrase ""good or bad"" is a more neutral and formal way to express the idea in English.)

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of grammar, word choice, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references. The reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding in English, while the machine translation has some errors and inaccuracies that can make it difficult to understand.

1. Grammar and syntax:
The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the verb ""began"" in the present tense. The reference translation uses the correct verb form ""began to dominate.""
2. Word choice and vocabulary:
The machine translation uses the word ""vormid"" (forms) instead of ""vormi"" (power). This is a minor error, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""olid neis"" (were the last form of power), which is a common way to express the idea of something being the final or ultimate form of something in Estonian.
4. Cultural references:
The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the sentence, which is important in Estonian. The phrase ""olid neis"" is often used to refer to the idea that something is the final or ultimate form of power in a particular culture or society.
5. Fluency and naturalness:
The machine translation does not sound as natural and fluent as the reference translation. The reference translation flows better and is more idiomatic in Estonian.

Based on these evaluations, I would give the machine translation a lower rating than the reference translation. While the machine translation is generally accurate, it lacks the nuance and cultural context that is present in the reference translation.

2. Number agreement: The machine translation incorrectly uses the singular form ""injured"" to describe a plural noun ""people"". The reference translation correctly uses the plural form ""were injured"" to agree with the plural noun ""people"".
3. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""Twenty-five people"" comes before the verb ""were injured"", while in the reference translation, the verb ""were injured"" comes before the noun phrase ""Twenty-five people"".
4. Preposition usage: The machine translation uses the preposition ""in"" before the noun ""fire"", while the reference translation uses the preposition ""in the fire"".
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""generation"" to translate the Estonian word ""viis"", which can mean both ""generation"" and ""fire"". The reference translation correctly uses the word ""fire"" to translate the Estonian word ""viis"".

Machine Translation:

* The machine translation uses the word ""erroneously"" instead of ""explicitly"" to convey the meaning of the original Estonian sentence.
* The word ""erroneously"" implies that the learning process is incorrect or mistaken, which may not be the intended meaning of the original sentence.

Reference Translation:

* The reference translation uses the word ""explicitly"" to convey the meaning of the original Estonian sentence.
* ""Explicitly"" means that something is clearly and directly stated, rather than implied or inferred.

Comparison:

* The machine translation uses a different word than the reference translation to convey the meaning of the original sentence.
* The machine translation's use of ""erroneously"" implies a mistake or incorrectness, while the reference translation's use of ""explicitly"" emphasizes clarity and directness.
* The difference in word choice may affect the overall meaning and nuance of the translation, as ""erroneously"" has a more negative connotation than ""explicitly"".

Conclusion:

Based on my analysis, the machine translation and the reference translation have different word choices and connotations, which may affect the overall meaning and nuance of the translation. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original Estonian sentence, as it uses the word ""explicitly"" to convey the intended meaning. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses a different word that may not accurately convey the intended meaning and may result in a less nuanced translation.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""This time, protests against the rampant corruption in tax office and calls for the expansion of democratic freedoms."" (incorrect use of ""this time"" and ""tax office"")
	* Reference translation: ""This time, they protested against the rampant corruption in the tax authority and called for the expansion of democratic freedoms."" (correct use of ""this time"" and ""tax authority"")
2. Word choice and vocabulary:

		+ Reference translation: ""taxes"" (correct)
	* Machine translation: ""vohava"" (machine translation: ""rampant"")
		+ Reference translation: ""rampant"" (correct)

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""beauty"" instead of ""fireworks"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""beauty"" does not accurately convey the meaning of the Estonian phrase ""ilutulestikutehases,"" which specifically refers to fireworks.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""there was"") instead of the past tense (""there was an explosion"") in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the Estonian phrase, placing ""Gragnano"" after the verb instead of before it. This is a common error in machine translations, as they often struggle with word order in languages that have different grammatical structures.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation gets the location of the explosion wrong, stating that it occurred in ""Gragnano"" instead of ""Gragnano,"" which is the correct location of the fireworks factory.

Overall, the machine translation is not very accurate and contains several errors compared to the reference translation. The reference translation is more precise and accurate in conveying the meaning of the Estonian phrase. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for any further translations or communications.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""expulsion options"" (MT) vs. ""explicit choice"" (Ref)
		+ The machine translation uses the term ""expulsion options"" instead of ""explicit choice"". This is a minor difference, but it may affect the overall meaning of the sentence. ""Expulsion options"" could imply a broader range of choices, while ""explicit choice"" is more specific and refers to a clear and direct decision.
2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""taking place largely before"" (MT) vs. ""taking place largely beforehand"" (Ref)
		+ The machine translation uses the present tense ""taking place"" instead of the past tense ""took place largely beforehand"". This is a more significant difference, as it affects the time frame of the decision-making process. The reference translation uses the past tense to indicate that the decision-making process occurred in the past, while the machine translation uses the present tense to suggest that the decision-making process is ongoing.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""because decision making is taking place largely before"" (MT) vs. ""because decision making takes place largely beforehand"" (Ref)
		+ The machine translation rearranges the word order to place ""decision making"" before ""taking place"". The reference translation maintains the original word order, with ""because"" followed by ""decision making takes place"". This is a minor difference, but it may affect the clarity and flow of the sentence.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""cultivated"" (MT) vs. ""cultivated"" (Ref)
		+ The machine translation uses the word ""cultivated"" without any changes, while the reference translation also uses the word ""cultivated"". This is a minor difference, as both translations use the same word to convey the same meaning.
5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""it does not seem so obvious that it can be cultivated"" (MT) vs. ""it does not seem so obvious that it can be cultivated"" (Ref)
		+ The machine translation and the reference translation use the same grammatical structure and wording, so there are no differences in this aspect.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, tense, word order, and idiomatic expressions. However, the differences are minor and do not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

The machine translation uses the phrase ""Järgmine tähtis mõisteline uuendus"" which is a more formal and literal way to translate ""Another important innovation in this sense"". The reference translation uses a more common and idiomatic way to express the same idea.
3. Idioms and expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""tégemine"" (to make)
	* Reference translation: ""to make figures""
	
The machine translation uses the word ""tégemine"" which is the Estonian word for ""to make"". However, the reference translation uses the phrase ""to make figures"" which is a more common and idiomatic way to express the same idea in English.
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Järgmine tähtis mõisteline uuendus oli proportsioonidest arvude tegemine."" (Another important innovation in this sense was to make figures of proportion.)
	* Reference translation: ""Another important conceptual innovation was to make figures out of proportions.""
	
The machine translation and the reference translation have different sentence structures. The machine translation uses a more formal and literal way to express the idea, while the reference translation uses a more common and idiomatic way to express the same idea.

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""bbovies"" instead of ""arboviruses"". This is a clear error, as ""arboviruses"" is the correct term used in scientific contexts.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""pass on"") instead of the correct tense for a scientific statement (""pass on to"").
3. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""via blood-sucking insects"" which is commonly used in scientific contexts to refer to the transmission of arboviruses.
4. Accuracy: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""inimestele"" as ""humans"", when in fact it should be translated as ""insects"".
5. Consistency: The machine translation inconsistently translates ""kanduvad"" as ""pass on"" in one place, and ""bbovies"" in another.
6. Context: The machine translation does not take into account the context of the sentence, which is a scientific statement about the transmission of arboviruses.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate, consistent, and takes into account the context of the sentence. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the basis for further translation work.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""põgenes"" (escaped)
	* Reference translation: ""invaded""
	
The machine translation uses the word ""põgenes"" which means ""escaped"" in Estonian, while the reference translation uses ""invaded"". This difference may be due to the nuances of the source language, as ""põgenes"" may not necessarily convey the same meaning as ""invaded"".

2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""enne"" (just before)

Both the machine translation and the reference translation use the phrase ""just before"", but the machine translation uses the Estonian word ""enne"" which means ""just before"" in English.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""tungimist linna"" (the language)
	* Reference translation: ""the knights invaded""
	
The machine translation places the word ""tungimist"" (language) at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation places it at the beginning of the sentence. This difference may be due to the grammatical structure of the source language.

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""rüütlite tungimist"" (rain invaded)
	* Reference translation: ""the knights invaded""
	
The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""rüütlite tungimist"" which means ""rain invaded"", while the reference translation uses the more common English phrase ""the knights invaded"". This difference may be due to the cultural context and the intended meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word choice, tense, word order, and idiomatic expressions. While the machine translation may be able to capture the general meaning of the sentence, it may not always produce the most accurate or idiomatic translation, especially when dealing with culturally-specific expressions or nuances of the source language.

	* Reference translation: ""Sergey Shoigu""
	* Difference: The machine translation spells the name of the Russian Defence Minister incorrectly. This can affect the credibility of the translation.
4. Word order:

Machine Translation: ""It further fragments Syria, with Atabek Kerbogha in power in Mosul.""

Reference Translation: ""This caused further fragmentation of Syria , with Atabek Kerbogha ruling in Mosul.""

Differences:

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""fragments"" instead of ""caused further fragmentation"". While ""fragments"" is a valid translation of the Estonian word ""killustas"", it doesn't convey the same level of complexity and nuance as the reference translation.
2. Tense: The machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation is in the past tense. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word order: The machine translation puts the name of the ruler, Atabek Kerbogha, at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation places it earlier in the sentence. This is a matter of style and personal preference, but it can affect the overall clarity and readability of the sentence.
4. Grammar: The machine translation uses the passive voice, while the reference translation uses the active voice. This can affect the overall clarity and flow of the sentence, but it's a relatively minor difference.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or nuanced as the reference translation. While it gets the basic meaning of the sentence across, it lacks the level of detail and complexity that the reference translation provides.

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""The second way of recognising evil is through bad faith in the perpetrator."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""The second way of confessing evil is pity towards the perpetrator."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the wrong word order in the sentence, which results in an awkward and unnatural sentence structure. The reference translation correctly uses the word ""confessing"" instead of ""recognising"" and also uses the correct word order.

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""bad faith"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""pity"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the word ""bad faith"" which doesn't quite convey the same meaning as the Estonian word ""pity"". ""Pity"" implies a feeling of compassion or sympathy towards the perpetrator, while ""bad faith"" has a more negative connotation.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""haletsus pahategija vastu"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""confessing evil"" (correct)

The machine translation uses a phrase that doesn't quite translate well into English. ""Haletsus pahategija vastu"" is a Estonian idiomatic expression that means ""to confess one's sins"", but it doesn't convey the same meaning as the reference translation.

4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""evil"" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""evil"" (correct)

The machine translation uses the word ""evil"" without any context, which doesn't make sense in the sentence. The reference translation correctly uses the word ""evil"" to refer to the act of doing harm or wrongdoing.

In the machine translation, ""Estonia was visited by Victoria Nuland"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed after ""Eestit külastas."" This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with word order and sentence structure.

3. Proper nouns: In the machine translation, ""Victoria Nuland"" is translated as ""Victoria Nulandi,"" which is incorrect. In the reference translation, it is translated correctly as ""Victoria Nuland."" This is a more significant difference, as the proper noun ""Victoria Nuland"" is an important part of the sentence.

Machine Translation: ""The 2014 edition is a front line for Mary Midgley.""

Reference Translation: ""The 2014 edition includes a foreword by Mary Midgley.""

The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are:

1. Word order: In the machine translation, the words are rearranged to create a more literal translation. The sentence ""The 2014 edition is a front line for Mary Midgley"" is a more literal translation of the Estonian sentence ""2014. aasta väljaanne on varustatud Mary Midgley eessõnaga,"" where ""aasta väljaanne"" is the subject, ""Mary Midgley"" is the object, and ""eessõnaga"" is the prepositional phrase. In the reference translation, the words are rearranged to create a more natural English sentence, with ""The 2014 edition includes a foreword by Mary Midgley"" being a more idiomatic way of expressing the same idea.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""is"") to indicate that the 2014 edition is the current edition, while the reference translation uses the past tense (""includes"") to indicate that the foreword was written by Mary Midgley in 2014.
3. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""front line"" to translate ""varustatud,"" which means ""equipped with"" or ""furnished with."" While ""front line"" can sometimes be used to refer to something that is state-of-the-art or cutting-edge, it may not be the most appropriate choice in this context, as it could give the impression that the 2014 edition is a new or updated version of the book. In contrast, the reference translation uses the more neutral phrase ""includes a foreword,"" which is a more accurate reflection of the meaning of the Estonian sentence.

Overall, while the machine translation is grammatically correct, it does not convey the same meaning or nuance as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more natural and idiomatic expression of the idea, and is therefore a better representation of the original Estonian sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation: ""The rose-tinted comfort was that he was in the village.""

* The machine translation uses the word ""comfort"" instead of the correct translation ""hulka"" in the reference translation.
* The phrase ""rose-tinted"" is not a direct translation of the Estonian word ""raesaali"" and does not convey the same meaning. In Estonian, ""raesaali"" refers to a feeling of comfort or relaxation, often associated with being in a warm or cozy place.
* The word ""village"" is not the correct translation of the Estonian word ""kuulus"". In Estonian, ""kuulus"" refers to a specific location or area, such as a town or a building.

Reference Translation: ""The comforts of the Town Hall included heating.""

* The reference translation uses the correct translation of ""hulka"" as ""comforts"".
* The phrase ""The Town Hall"" is a more accurate translation of the Estonian word ""kuulus"".
* The word ""included"" is a more appropriate verb than ""was"" in this context, as it implies a more permanent or ongoing state of being.

Overall, the machine translation makes several significant errors in this sentence, including the use of the wrong word for ""comfort"", the incorrect translation of ""kuulus"", and the use of the wrong verb tense. The reference translation, on the other hand, provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the Estonian sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation for the given sentence:

Machine Translation: ""mysterious weapons of origin have been found in waste-free distilleries.""

Reference Translation: ""Mycenaean weapons have been found in Cretan burial sites.""

1. Word choice: The machine translation uses the term ""mysterious weapons of origin"" instead of ""Mycenaean weapons"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""Mycenaean"" refers to a specific culture and time period, while ""mysterious weapons of origin"" is a more general term that could apply to any unknown or unidentified weapons.
2. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense (""have been found"") instead of the past tense (""have been discovered"") in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Vocabulary: The machine translation uses the term ""waste-free distilleries"" instead of ""Cretan burial sites"" in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""Cretan burial sites"" refers to a specific location and cultural context, while ""waste-free distilleries"" is a nonsensical term that doesn't make sense in this context.
4. Cultural context: The reference translation includes the cultural context of the Mycenaean civilization, which is absent in the machine translation. The reference translation mentions ""Cretan burial sites,"" which is a specific cultural and historical context that is relevant to the sentence.
5. Accuracy: The machine translation contains a significant error in the word choice, as ""Mycenaean"" refers to a specific culture and time period, while ""mysterious weapons of origin"" is a more general term. This error can affect the overall accuracy of the translation.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or culturally relevant as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more specific and culturally appropriate term for the Mycenaean civilization, and it also includes the cultural context that is relevant to the sentence. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses more general terms and lacks the cultural context that is essential for a accurate translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""suicide bomber""

The machine translation uses the term ""suicide bomber,"" which is a more general term that can refer to any type of suicide attack. The reference translation, on the other hand, uses the term ""suicide terrorist,"" which specifically refers to an attacker who uses violence to achieve a political goal.

2. Grammar:

	* Machine translation: ""In the town of Kirkūk in Iraq a suicide bomber attacked a police station full of a truck filled with a explosives.""
	* Reference translation: ""In the town of Kirkūk in Iraq a suicide terrorist attacked a police station with a truck filled with explosives.""

The machine translation lacks punctuation at the end of the sentence, which can make it difficult to understand the sentence's meaning. The reference translation includes punctuation, which makes the sentence easier to read and understand.

4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""In the town of Kirkūk in Iraq a suicide bomber attacked a police station full of a truck filled with a explosives.""
	* Reference translation: ""In the town of Kirkūk in Iraq a suicide terrorist attacked a police station with a truck filled with explosives.""

The machine translation is not accurate in its translation of the word ""lõhkeainega,"" which means ""terrorist"" in Estonian. The reference translation correctly translates this word as ""suicide terrorist.""

	* Machine translation: ""If there is no agreement among scientists as to whether the fundamental problems in this area have been solved""
	* Reference translation: ""If there is no agreement among scientists as to whether the fundamental problems in this field have been solved""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""this area"" instead of ""this field"", which is the more appropriate term in this context.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""the search for rules will play a role that it usually does not have""
	* Reference translation: ""the search for rules will play a role that it usually does not have""

Both translations are grammatically correct, but the machine translation uses the phrase ""it usually does not have"" twice, which is unnecessary and makes the sentence slightly awkward.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""omandab reeglite otsimine rolli""
	* Reference translation: ""the search for rules will play a role""

The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""omandab reeglite otsimine rolli"", which is a bit awkward and doesn't convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more idiomatic English phrase, ""the search for rules will play a role"".

4. Tone and style:

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation is more idiomatic and conveys the meaning of the original Estonian sentence more effectively.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""People's Pringe of Freedom"" (Saks)
	* Reference translation: ""people's primordial desire for freedom"" (Saks)

Both translations use the word ""freedom"" (Saks), but the reference translation uses a more idiomatic phrase ""primordial desire for freedom"" to convey the idea of a fundamental or innate desire for freedom, which is a more accurate representation of the original Estonian phrase.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""which turned the organised uprising into a rebels"" (Saks)

Both translations use the passive voice to convey the idea of an uprising being turned into something else, but the reference translation uses the more idiomatic phrase ""revolt"" to convey the idea of a more violent and sustained resistance movement.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""People's Pringe of Freedom"" (Saks)

1. Word order: The machine translation uses the word order ""Russian President Vladimir Putin met Pope Benedict XVI in the Vatican"" while the reference translation uses ""Russian President Vladimir Putin met Pope Benedict XVI in the Vatican."" The reference translation maintains the original word order of the source text, which is more accurate.
2. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""Vatican"" while the reference translation does not. The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as the Vatican is a proper noun and should not have an article.
3. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include any punctuation after ""Vatican"" in the second sentence, while the reference translation includes a period. The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as punctuation is important for clarity and readability.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses ""kohtus"" (meeting) instead of ""met"" in the first sentence, which is a more formal and literal translation of the Estonian word. The reference translation uses ""met"" which is a more common and idiomatic way to express the idea of meeting in English.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout the translation, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the second sentence to indicate that the meeting took place in the past. The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as the tense of the translation should match the tense of the source text.
6. Idioms and expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expressions used in the source text, such as ""Venemaa president"" (which means ""Russian President"") and ""paavst Benedictus XVI"" (which means ""Pope Benedict XVI"").

2. Measurement units: The machine translation uses ""metres"" to translate the Estonian word ""poolteist"", which is the correct unit of measurement for length. However, the reference translation uses ""one and a half meters"", which is a more idiomatic way of expressing the same measurement in English.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present simple tense (""is broader"") to translate the Estonian verb ""oli"", which is in the present perfect tense in the source text. This may indicate that the machine translation is not fully capturing the nuances of Estonian grammar.
4. Word order: The machine translation reverses the word order of the source text, placing the adjective ""broader"" after the noun ""trade"" instead of before it. This is a common mistake in machine translation, as the algorithm may not always prioritize the correct word order in a sentence.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in this case.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Machine translation: ""miks teine moraalilause hoiatab teo maksiimi ja eesmärgi segiajamise eest""
Reference translation: ""It is therefore difficult to understand why the second moral sentence warns about confusing the maxim of an act with its objective""

The machine translation seems to have struggled with the word order in the original Estonian sentence. The phrase ""miks teine moraalilause"" should be translated as ""why the second moral sentence"" rather than ""why teine moraalilause"", and ""hoiatab"" should be translated as ""warns"" rather than ""difficult to understand"". Additionally, the phrase ""segiajamise eest"" is not a correct translation of ""its objective"", which should be translated as ""its purpose"".

2. Machine translation: ""It is therefore difficult to understand why a second moral sentence warns of maxim and purpose.""
Reference translation: ""It is therefore difficult to understand why the second moral sentence warns about confusing the maxim of an act with its objective.""

The machine translation has changed the meaning of the sentence entirely. The original Estonian sentence is asking why the second moral sentence warns about something, but the machine translation is saying that it is difficult to understand why the second moral sentence warns about something else entirely.

3. Machine translation: ""maxiimi""
Reference translation: ""maxim""

The machine translation has changed the spelling of the word ""maxiimi"" to ""maxiimi"", which is not a correct spelling in English. The correct spelling is ""maxim"".

Based on these differences, I would give the machine translation a score of 2 out of 5 for accuracy. The machine translation has made several significant errors in the translation, including changing the word order, using the wrong spelling of a word, and changing the meaning of the sentence entirely. The reference translation, on the other hand, has provided a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the original Estonian sentence.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Grammar and syntax:
	* Machine translation: ""It was known in advance that Euwe would lose intentionally and had known in advance that Botvinnik would lose intentionally.""
	* Reference translation: ""It was known in advance that Euwe would lose intentionally and it was known in advance that Botvinnik would lose intentionally.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the past perfect tense (""had known"") in the second sentence, while the reference translation uses the simple past tense (""knew""). The past perfect tense is not necessary in this context, and the reference translation is more concise and natural-sounding.
2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Euwe kaotab"" (Euwe loses)
	* Reference translation: ""Euva kaotab"" (Euwa loses)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""kaotab"" (loses), which is the Estonian word for ""Euwe"". However, the reference translation uses the word ""kaotab"" (loses) in the context of the sentence, which is more natural and idiomatic.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""tahtlikult"" (in advance)
	* Reference translation: ""etage"" (in advance)
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the word ""tahtlikult"", which is a more formal and literal translation of the Estonian word ""etage"". The reference translation uses the more common and idiomatic ""etage"".
4. Sentence structure:
	* Machine translation: ""Oli ette teada, et Euwe kaotab tahtlikult ja oli ette teada, et Botvinnik kaotab tahtlikult.""
	* Reference translation: ""It was known in advance that Euwe would lose and it was known in advance that Botvinnik would lose.""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure, with two clauses separated by ""ja"". The reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure, with two independent clauses.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more common and idiomatic expressions, and the sentence structure is simpler and more straightforward. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses some more formal and literal translations, which can make the sentence sound less natural and less idiomatic.

2. Use of prepositions: The machine translation uses the preposition ""from"" instead of ""about"" in the phrase ""information from Allan."" In the reference translation, the preposition ""about"" is used to indicate the purpose of the visit.
3. Name spelling: The machine translation spells the name ""Allana"" differently than the reference translation, which spells it ""Allan.""
4. Tense: The machine translation uses the present tense (""has to"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""came""). This difference in tense may be due to the fact that the reference translation is a past event, while the machine translation is a present or future event.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""succession"" instead of ""bequest."" While both words can be translated as ""jahimine"" in Estonian, the reference translation uses the word ""bequest"" to convey a more specific meaning.
6. Grammar: The machine translation uses a different grammatical structure than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence is structured as a simple sentence with a subject-verb-object word order, while in the reference translation, it is structured as a compound sentence with a subordinate clause.

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation is not as accurate or natural-sounding as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more precise and idiomatic translation of the original Estonian sentence, while the machine translation introduces some errors and inaccuracies.

4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: ""Henriu Libya"" (machine translation) vs. ""Henry"" (reference translation)

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation has some inaccuracies and mistranslations. For example, the machine translation uses the name ""Henriu Libya"" instead of ""Henry,"" which is the correct name of the chronicler. Additionally, the machine translation uses the word ""oletusi"" instead of ""beliefs,"" which is not a direct translation of the Estonian word ""oletusi.""

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. It uses more appropriate word choices and grammar structures, and it is more faithful to the original Estonian text.

3. Spelling: The machine translation spells ""Taveco Disain"" differently than the reference translation, which spells it as ""Taveco Disain"".
4. Punctuation: The machine translation adds a comma after ""Disain"" in the reference translation, while the reference translation does not have any punctuation after ""Disain"".
5. Accent marks: The machine translation does not include the accent marks on the words ""Kirjastuste"" and ""Disain"" in the reference translation, while the reference translation does include them.

1. Word choice:

	* Reference translation: ""artillery platforms""

The machine translation uses the term ""stem platforms,"" which is not a common term in English. The reference translation uses the term ""artillery platforms,"" which is more accurate and specific.

2. Tense:
	* Machine translation: ""had already collapsed""
	* Reference translation: ""had already collapsed"" (no change)

Both translations use the past tense, but the machine translation uses the past participle form of the verb ""collapse,"" which is not necessary in this context.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""had already collapsed""
	* Reference translation: ""artillery platforms, which were added during the Stuarts ' period , had already collapsed""

The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing the verb ""had already collapsed"" at the end of the sentence. The reference translation maintains the original word order of the Estonian sentence.

4. Phraseology:
	* Machine translation: ""juba lagunenud""
	* Reference translation: ""during the Stuarts ' period""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""juba lagunenud,"" which is not a common way to express the idea of ""during"" in English. The reference translation uses the more common phrase ""during the Stuarts ' period.""

5. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""olid juba lagunenud""
	* Reference translation: ""had already collapsed""

The machine translation uses the accusative case of the verb ""olid,"" which is not necessary in this context. The reference translation uses the present perfect tense of the verb ""collapsed,"" which is more appropriate for a past action that has a lasting effect.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The machine translation makes several errors in word choice, tense, word order, phraseology, and grammar, which can make the translation sound awkward or unnatural to an English speaker.

1. Source Text:

Source: Frankfurti järgi tuleneb see hoopis sellest, et vanemad armastavad oma lapsi väga.

2. Machine Translation:

Machine Translation: Instead, according to Frankfurt, it is because parents very much love their children.

3. Reference Translation:

Reference Translation: Instead , according to Frankfurt , it is because parents very much love their children .

Differences:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine Translation: ""tuleneb"" (Estonian) -> ""love"" (English)
	* Reference Translation: ""love"" (English)
2. Grammar:
	* Machine Translation: ""see hoopis sellest"" (Estonian) -> ""it is because"" (English)

3. Phrase structure:
	* Machine Translation: ""vanemad armastavad oma lapsi väga"" (Estonian) -> ""parents very much love their children"" (English)
	* Reference Translation: ""very much love their children"" (English)

Comparison:

The machine translation and reference translation have some differences in word choice, grammar, and phrase structure. Here are some observations:

* The machine translation uses the word ""love"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses ""very much love"" in the second instance.
* The machine translation changes the word order in the second sentence, moving ""vanemad"" (parents) to the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation keeps the original word order.
* The machine translation uses the phrase ""it is because"" to connect the second sentence to the first, while the reference translation uses ""according to Frankfurt"".

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the original meaning of the Estonian sentence. The machine translation changes the word choice, grammar, and phrase structure, which can result in a loss of meaning or a change in the intended message. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower rating compared to the reference translation.

	* Machine translation: ""ksukutati"" is translated as ""overthrown"" in both translations, but the reference translation uses ""overthrew"" in the second sentence.
2. Grammar:

	* Machine translation: The machine translation omits the article ""the"" before ""Serbian wife"", while the reference translation includes it.
3. Fluency:

	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the word ""abikaasaga"" which is not a common word in English and could be translated as ""overthrown"" or ""deposed"".
4. Cultural nuances:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not capture the cultural nuance of the phrase ""vanem poeg"", which in this context means the eldest son of the deceased tsar, and not just any son.
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""kes kukutati"" which is commonly used in Estonian to mean ""to overthrow"".

Based on these differences, it's clear that the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the Estonian language and culture better, and the phrasing is more natural and fluent. The machine translation, on the other hand, has some awkward phrasing and omits important cultural details.

Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""Yemeni Government"" and ""rebel representatives,"" while the reference translation does not use the definite article. This is a stylistic difference between the two translations, as the reference translation uses the indefinite article ""a"" instead.
3. Plural nouns: The machine translation consistently uses the plural form of nouns throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the singular form for ""representatives."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall clarity and accuracy of the translation.
4. Punctuation: The machine translation uses a comma after ""Switzerland"" in the reference translation, while the reference translation does not use a comma after ""Switzerland."" This is a stylistic difference between the two translations, as the reference translation prefers to use a period at the end of the sentence.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""negotiations"" in both instances, while the reference translation uses the word ""peace negotiations"" in the first instance and simply ""negotiations"" in the second instance. This is a difference in word choice between the two translations, as the reference translation uses more specific language to convey the context of the sentence.
6. Grammar: The machine translation uses the present tense throughout the sentence, while the reference translation uses the past tense in the second instance. This is a difference in grammar between the two translations, as the reference translation is more accurate in terms of tense consistency.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some differences in word order, article usage, plural nouns, punctuation, word choice, and grammar. While the machine translation is generally understandable, the reference translation is more accurate and nuanced in its language use.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""The idea is one of the oldest"" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is placed after the noun ""manor"".
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""was"" to describe the year 1396, while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense ""expanded"". This suggests that the reference translation is more accurate in terms of tense consistency.
3. Number agreement: The machine translation has a mistake in the number agreement of the noun ""villages"". It says ""there in addition to three villages"" instead of ""there are three villages"".
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""sinna"" instead of ""sina"", which is the correct word in Estonian.
5. Grammar: The machine translation has a grammatical error in the sentence structure. It should be ""Hincke bought three more villages"" instead of ""Hincke bought there in addition to three villages"".
6. Idiomatic expressions: The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic expression ""juurde veel lisaks"" which means ""to buy more land"".

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the original Estonian text and captures the nuances of the language better. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Islamiriik vastu korraldatud rünnakutes"" (Islamic extremist organisation)
	* Reference translation: ""Islamic State""

The machine translation uses the term ""Islamiriik vastu korraldatud rünnakutes"" which is a more formal and technical term in Estonian, while the reference translation uses the more commonly known term ""Islamic State"".

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Süürias"" (Syria)
	* Reference translation: ""in Syria""

The machine translation uses the genitive case for ""Syria"" (""Süürias""), while the reference translation uses the prepositional phrase ""in Syria"" to indicate the location.

3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""osalesid esimest korda"" (the German Air Force)
	* Reference translation: ""the German Air Force participated""

The machine translation places the adjective ""esimest"" (German) before the noun ""osalesid"" (Air Force), while the reference translation places the adjective ""German"" after the noun ""Air Force"".

4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""islamistliku"" (Islamic)
	* Reference translation: ""Islamic""

The machine translation uses the phrase ""islamistliku"" which is not a common or idiomatic expression in English, while the reference translation uses the simpler and more common term ""Islamic"".

5. Tone and style:
	* Machine translation: The tone and style of the machine translation are more formal and technical, while the reference translation is more informal and conversational.

Overall, the machine translation is more formal and technical in its language choices, while the reference translation is more informal and conversational.

	* Machine translation: ""alustas"" (begins) is translated as ""began"" in the machine translation. However, the reference translation uses ""began"" as well.
	* Machine translation: ""neljapäevast"" (four-day) is translated as ""Thursday"" in the machine translation. This is an incorrect translation, as ""neljapäevast"" specifically refers to a four-day period of time, not a specific day of the week.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the present tense (""begins"") for the verb ""alustas,"" while the reference translation uses the past tense (""began"") to indicate that the visit occurred in the past.
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the singular form of the verb ""visit"" (""visit"") in the sentence, while the reference translation uses the plural form (""visits"") to indicate that the president is on an official visit.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation does not translate the idiomatic expression ""ametlikku visiiti"" correctly. The reference translation uses ""four-day visit"" to convey the same meaning.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""Czech"" before ""President"" in the sentence. In the reference translation, the word order is correct, with ""Czech President"" appearing first.
5. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Venemaal"" as ""Russia."" The correct translation is ""Russia.""

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and accuracy. Therefore, I would recommend using the reference translation as the more reliable source for Estonian-English translation.

Machine Translation: ""For the 17th century, the definition of the number had expanded considerably.""
Reference Translation: ""By the 17th century, the definition of the number had expanded considerably.""

Differences:

* The source text uses the phrase ""sajandiks oli"" which means ""there was"" in English, while the machine translation uses ""For the 17th century"" which is a more formal and literal translation of the source text.
* The machine translation changes the word order of the source text, placing ""definition of the number"" after ""had expanded considerably"" instead of before it.
* The reference translation maintains the original word order of the source text.
2. The source text uses the word ""tunduvalt"" which means ""considerably"" in English, while the machine translation uses ""had expanded considerably"" which is a more literal translation of the source text.
3. The source text uses the word ""arvu"" which means ""number"" in English, while the machine translation uses ""the number"" which is a more formal and literal translation of the source text.
4. The machine translation adds the word ""had"" before ""expanded"" which is not present in the source text or the reference translation.

Based on these differences, it can be seen that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in conveying the meaning of the source text. The machine translation changes the word order, adds unnecessary words, and uses a more formal and literal translation of certain words, which can make the sentence sound less natural and less accurate.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is moderate, but it can be improved by paying more attention to the nuances of language and the original word order of the source text.

2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure in the machine translation is more simplified and direct, with a subject-verb-object word order. In contrast, the reference translation maintains a more complex sentence structure with a subject-verb-object-adverb word order.
	* Machine translation: The use of the definite article ""the"" is missing in the machine translation, while it is present in the reference translation.
3. Idiomatic expressions:

	* Difference: The machine translation uses the verb ""jõudnud"" (had reached) in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the past tense ""had reached"". This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""taandus vastureformatsiooni konformismi"" (retreated into the conformist of the Counter-Reformation)
	* Reference translation: ""retreated into the conformity of the Counter-Reformation""
	* Difference: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing ""taandus"" (retreated) before ""vastureformatsiooni"" (of the Counter-Reformation). This can make the sentence harder to read and understand.
4. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""kriisini ja 17. sajandi alguses taandus vastureformatsiooni konformismi"" (By the middle of the 16th century, the Polish university, the Academy of Kraków had reached a crisis, and at the beginning of the 17th century retreated into the conformist of the Counter-Reformation)
	* Reference translation: ""By the middle of the 16th century, the Polish university, the Academy of Kraków had reached a crisis, and at the beginning of the 17th century retreated into the conformity of the Counter-Reformation""
	* Difference: The machine translation doesn't capture the idiomatic expression ""retreated into the conformity of the Counter-Reformation"". This is a common issue in machine translation, as it can't always understand the cultural and linguistic nuances of the source language.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, word order, and idiomatic expressions. While it's not a perfect translation, the reference translation provides a more accurate and natural-sounding translation of the original Estonian text.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""genital mutilation"" (MT) vs. ""genitals"" (RT)
		+ The machine translation uses the term ""genital mutilation,"" which is a more literal translation of the Estonian word ""suguelundite,"" but it may not be the most appropriate term in this context. The reference translation uses the more general term ""genitals"" to refer to the male or female reproductive organs.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""cannot be an accessories to their common good"" (MT) vs. ""cannot be an actualisation of the common good"" (RT)
		+ The machine translation uses the phrase ""an accessories to their common good,"" which is a more literal translation of the Estonian phrase ""aktiveerimine ei saa olla nende sõpruse ühise hüve aktualiseerimine,"" but it may not be the most idiomatic or natural-sounding phrase in English. The reference translation uses the phrase ""an actualisation of the common good,"" which is a more common and natural way to express the idea in English.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""friendship is not conjugal"" (MT) vs. ""friendship is not helpless"" (RT)
		+ The machine translation uses the phrase ""friendship is not conjugal,"" which is a more literal translation of the Estonian phrase ""sõprus ei ole abieluline,"" but it may not be the most idiomatic or natural-sounding phrase in English. The reference translation uses the phrase ""friendship is not helpless,"" which is a more common and natural way to express the idea in English.
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""the activation of friends' genital mutilation"" (MT) vs. ""the activation of friends' genitals"" (RT)
		+ The machine translation and the reference translation have different word orders, with the machine translation placing the genitalia before the friends, while the reference translation places the friends before the genitalia. This may affect the overall meaning of the sentence, with the machine translation potentially implying that the genitalia are being activated by the friends, while the reference translation implies that the friends are being activated by their genitalia.

Overall, the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding than the machine translation, and it better conveys the meaning of the original Estonian sentence. However, the machine translation is still understandable and may be suitable for certain contexts or audiences.

	* Machine translation: ""muslimid ja teiste usundite järgijad"" vs. Reference translation: ""Muslims and followers of other religions""

Based on these differences, it seems that the machine translation has some errors in word choice, grammar, and phrasing. For example, the machine translation uses the plural form of the verb ""to represent"" instead of the singular form, and it uses the plural form of the noun ""religions"" instead of the singular form. Additionally, the machine translation uses the word ""moodustasid"" instead of ""protestants"" in the first sentence, which is a minor error but could be corrected.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic than the machine translation. However, it's worth noting that machine translation can be a useful tool for getting a general sense of the meaning of a text, and it can be helpful for translating texts that are not highly technical or specialized.

	* Reference translation: ""Portugali ajaloos oli"" (Estonian) -> ""Portuguese history was"" (English)

The machine translation uses the present tense ""is"" instead of the past tense ""was"" in the reference translation. This may affect the time frame of the sentence.

3. Phrasing:

	* Reference translation: ""Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo, appointed Minister for Social Affairs in 1974"" (English)

The machine translation keeps the word order of the Estonian source, while the reference translation rearranges the words to make it more clear and natural in English.

5. Idiomatic expressions:

2. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: ""Mõned teadlased"" (some scientists)
	* Reference translation: ""Some scientists""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian word ""teadlased"" instead of the English word ""scientists"". While both words convey the same meaning, the machine translation may not be as accurate or natural-sounding in certain contexts.
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""pöördruutude seaduse asendamist"" (replacing the law on reverse rooms)
	* Reference translation: ""inverse-square law""
	* Difference: The machine translation uses the Estonian phrase ""pöördruutude seaduse asendamist"" instead of the English phrase ""inverse-square law"". This phrase is not directly equivalent to the English phrase, and it may not convey the same meaning or connotation.
4. Accuracy:

Based on my analysis, the reference translation is more accurate and fluent than the machine translation. The machine translation makes several errors in word choice, grammar, and idiomatic expressions, which can affect the overall quality of the translation.

Here are some potential reasons why the machine translation may have produced these errors:

1. Lack of context: The machine translation may not have had access to the full context of the sentence, which can lead to errors in word choice and grammar.
2. Limited vocabulary: The machine translation may not have had enough vocabulary to accurately translate certain words or phrases, leading to substitutions or omissions.
3. Incorrect training data: The machine translation may have been trained on a dataset that contains errors or inaccuracies, which can be reflected in the output.

Overall, while machine translation can be a useful tool for quick and rough translations, it is important to carefully evaluate the quality of the output and consider using reference translations as a basis for accuracy and fluency.

The machine translation uses the incorrect word order in the sentence, with ""hoolimata"" (meaning ""remained"") placed after the verb ""fortunately"". In the reference translation, the word order is correct, with ""Niels Bohr"" appearing before the verb ""remained"".

2. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""Fortunately, Niels Bohr hoolimata sellest falsifikatsioonis oma teooriale kindlaks."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Fortunately, Niels Bohr, despite this falsification, remained confident in his theory."" (correct)

The machine translation uses the word ""hoolimata"" (meaning ""stuck"") instead of ""remained"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""Fortunately, Niels Bohr hoolimata sellest falsifikatsioonis oma teooriale kindlaks."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Fortunately, Niels Bohr, despite this falsification, remained confident in his theory."" (correct)

The machine translation does not use the idiomatic expression ""remained confident"" in the reference translation. This can make the sentence sound less natural and less fluent in English.

4. Cultural references:
	* Machine translation: ""Fortunately, Niels Bohr hoolimata sellest falsifikatsioonis oma teooriale kindlaks."" (incorrect)
	* Reference translation: ""Fortunately, Niels Bohr, despite this falsification, remained confident in his theory."" (correct)

The machine translation does not take into account the cultural reference of ""Niels Bohr"" as a famous physicist, which is important in the context of the sentence.

Based on these differences, I would rate the quality of the machine translation as low, and the reference translation as high. The reference translation is more accurate, natural, and culturally appropriate, making it a better choice for communication in English.

Conclusion:
The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Estonian sentence. The term ""duty of happiness"" is not a common phrase used in English, and the verb ""mean"" is a more appropriate choice to convey the meaning of the Estonian sentence. Therefore, the reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation in this case.

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the subject ""Edgar Savisaar"" comes before the verb ""broke,"" whereas in the reference translation, the verb ""broke"" comes before the subject ""Edgar Savisaar."" This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with word order and sentence structure.
2. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense ""broke"" to indicate that the action of breaking the shoe happened in the past, while the reference translation uses the present tense ""broke"" to indicate that the subject ""Edgar Savisaar"" is currently breaking the shoe. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. Prepositions: The machine translation uses the preposition ""in"" to indicate the location where the action of breaking the shoe happened, while the reference translation uses the preposition ""at"" to indicate the location. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""shoe"" to translate the Estonian word ""kodutalus,"" while the reference translation uses the word ""leg."" This is a significant difference, as ""kodutalus"" has a broader meaning than ""shoe"" and can refer to any type of footwear, while ""leg"" specifically refers to the lower part of the human leg.
5. Grammar: The machine translation uses the accusative case for the noun ""Hundisilmal,"" while the reference translation uses the genitive case. This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word order, tense, prepositions, word choice, and grammar.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the phrase ""following mass arrests of Hutu"" comes after the date ""16 April,"" while in the reference translation, it comes before the date.
2. Use of ""Hutu"" vs. ""Hutu riot"": The machine translation uses the term ""Hutu"" twice, while the reference translation uses the term ""Hutu riot"" once. This may be due to a difference in translation strategy, with the machine translation choosing to repeat the term ""Hutu"" for emphasis, while the reference translation opting for a more concise translation.
3. Use of ""mass arrests"": The machine translation uses the phrase ""mass arrests of Hutu,"" while the reference translation uses the phrase ""Hutu riot."" This may indicate a difference in the level of detail and nuance in the translations. The machine translation may be more focused on conveying the fact that arrests occurred, while the reference translation may be more interested in emphasizing the identity of the people involved.
4. Tense: The machine translation is in the present tense, while the reference translation is in the past tense. This may be due to a difference in the source material or the intended audience of the translation.
5. Grammar: The machine translation has a few grammatical errors, such as the use of ""arreteerimist"" instead of ""arrested"" and ""hutude mäss"" instead of ""Hutu Mountains."" These errors may indicate a lower level of proficiency in Estonian or a lack of attention to detail in the translation process.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word order, terminology, and grammar. While the machine translation may be more straightforward in its translation, the reference translation provides more nuanced and detailed information. As a helpful assistant, I would recommend using the reference translation as the primary source for Estonian-English translation, and using the machine translation as a starting point for further refinement and editing.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis step by step:

1. Source Text: Demonstratsioon oli emotsioonidest kirgas, kuid rahumeelne.
Source: This is the original Estonian text that we will be translating.

2. Machine Translation: The machine translation of the source text is: ""The demonstration was in the coffin of emotions, but peaceful.""

3. Reference Translation: The reference translation of the source text is: ""The demonstration was bright with emotions, but peaceful.""

Comparison:

* The machine translation and reference translation differ in the following areas:
	+ Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""coffin"" to translate ""emotsioonidest"", which is not a common or idiomatic expression in English. A more accurate translation would be ""filled with emotions"".
	+ Tone: The machine translation conveys a sense of sadness or mourning, while the reference translation conveys a sense of vibrancy and energy.
	+ Word order: The machine translation puts the adjective ""peaceful"" after the noun ""demonstration"", while the reference translation places it before.

Conclusion:
Based on the comparison, the reference translation is more accurate and natural-sounding than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the nuances of the original Estonian text better, including the idea of emotions being present but not overwhelming. The machine translation, on the other hand, struggles to convey the same level of complexity and nuance in English.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""Prime Minister Mark Rutte"" comes before ""resigned his cabinet,"" while in the reference translation, it's the other way around. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with maintaining the same word order as the source language.
2. Article usage: In the machine translation, the definite article ""the"" is used before ""Netherlands,"" while in the reference translation, it's ""In the Netherlands."" This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. In this case, both translations convey the same information, but the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding.
3. Tense: The machine translation uses the past tense (""resigned"") to describe the event, while the reference translation uses the present tense (""resigned""). This is a more common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle with maintaining the correct tense consistency.
4. Plural nouns: The machine translation uses the plural form of the noun ""cabinet"" (""cabinets""), while the reference translation uses the singular form (""cabinet""). This is a minor difference, but it can affect the overall meaning of the sentence. In this case, both translations convey the same information, but the reference translation is more idiomatic and natural-sounding.
5. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""valitsuskabinet"" (cabinet of government), while the reference translation uses ""Prime Minister Mark Rutte 's cabinet."" This is a more significant difference, as the machine translation uses a more formal and technical term, while the reference translation uses a more idiomatic and natural-sounding phrase.

Overall, the machine translation and the reference translation have some significant differences in terms of word order, article usage, tense, and word choice. While the machine translation conveys the same information as the reference translation, it does so in a less idiomatic and natural-sounding way. Therefore, I would give the reference translation a higher quality rating than the machine translation.

2. Article usage: The machine translation uses the definite article ""the"" before ""Guinea"", while the reference translation does not use any article. In Estonian, the definite article is not necessary when the noun is the subject of the sentence, as in the reference translation.
3. Tense: The machine translation is in the past tense, while the reference translation is in the present tense. This is a common difference between machine translations and human translations, as machine translations often struggle to convey the nuances of tense and aspect in languages with complex grammatical systems.
4. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""announced"" instead of ""announced his resignation"". While both words convey the same meaning, the machine translation may not have the same level of nuance as the reference translation, which uses the more formal and formal phrase ""announced his resignation"".
5. Punctuation: The machine translation does not include any punctuation after the name ""Mohamed Said Fofana"", while the reference translation includes a period at the end of the sentence. This may affect the overall readability and clarity of the translation.

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate or nuanced as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more detailed and precise translation of the original text, while the machine translation is more general and lacks the same level of detail and accuracy.

1. Word choice: In the machine translation, the phrase ""it can easily be considered a hit"" is used, while in the reference translation, the phrase ""he is free to consider it relevant"" is used. This suggests that the machine translation may not have captured the nuance of the original Estonian phrase as accurately.
2. Tone: The machine translation has a more casual and informal tone, while the reference translation is more formal and professional. This may be due to differences in the way the translators approached the source text.
3. Grammar: The machine translation uses the phrase ""it can easily be considered a hit,"" which is a more literal translation of the Estonian phrase. However, in the reference translation, the phrase ""he is free to consider it relevant"" is more idiomatic and better conveys the intended meaning.
4. Cultural references: The machine translation may not capture cultural references or idioms that are specific to Estonian or English language usage. For example, the phrase ""hit"" in English can have different connotations depending on the context, and the machine translation may not have captured these nuances.
5. Context: The machine translation and reference translation may have different interpretations of the context in which the phrase is being used. For example, the machine translation may assume that the phrase is being used in a more general sense, while the reference translation may interpret it as being used in a specific context.

Overall, while both translations are grammatically correct, the machine translation may not have captured the nuances and cultural references of the original Estonian phrase as accurately as the reference translation.

1. Gender agreement: In the machine translation, the name ""Laimdota Straswima"" is translated as ""he"" instead of ""she"" to match the gender of the original Estonian name ""Laimdota Straujuma"". This is a common error in machine translation, as it can be difficult for the algorithm to determine the gender of a name based on its spelling.
2. Word order: In the machine translation, the sentence is translated as ""The Prime Minister of Latvia, Laimdota Straswima, announced his resignation."" In contrast, the reference translation uses the word order ""The Prime Minister of Latvia, Laimdota Straujuma, announced her resignation."" This difference in word order can affect the clarity and naturalness of the translation.

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation makes several changes to the word order, phrase structure, article usage, noun agreement, preposition usage, and word choice, which can result in a less natural and less accurate translation. Therefore, I would give the machine translation a lower quality rating than the reference translation.

  Sure, I'd be happy to help you evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""säilinud"" (preserved) is translated as ""kept"" in the machine translation, but ""varustas"" (provided) would be a more accurate translation of the Estonian verb ""säilinud"".
	* Reference translation: ""omakäeliste"" (side notes) is a more accurate translation of the Estonian word ""omakäeliste"", as it better conveys the meaning of the word.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the verb ""has"" in the present tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""kept"" in the past tense to match the tense of the Estonian verb ""säilinud"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the past tense of the verb ""write"" to match the tense of the Estonian verb ""written"".
3. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the phrase ""a few peripheral remarks"" which is a bit awkward and not a direct translation of the Estonian phrase ""omakäeliste ääremärkustega"". A more accurate translation would be ""a few marginal notes"".
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the phrase ""in his own hand"" which is a more accurate translation of the Estonian phrase ""omakäeliste"".
4. Word order:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation changes the word order of the Estonian sentence, placing the verb ""säilinud"" before the noun ""tema"". In Estonian, the word order is typically SVO (Subject-Verb-Object).
	* Reference translation: The reference translation maintains the original word order of the Estonian sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of word choice, grammar, idiomatic expressions, and word order. The reference translation provides a more faithful translation of the Estonian sentence, while the machine translation introduces some errors and inaccuracies.

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""šimpansid"" (chimpanzees) is translated as ""anti-foetuses"" which is not a correct translation. The correct translation for ""chimpanzees"" in Estonian is ""simpsonsid"".
	* Reference translation: ""simpsonsid"" is translated as ""chimpanzees"" correctly.
2. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: The sentence structure in the machine translation is different from the reference translation. The machine translation uses a compound sentence with multiple clauses, while the reference translation uses a simple sentence with a subject-verb-object structure.
3. Vocabulary:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation uses the word ""šimpansid"" (chimpanzees) which is not found in the reference translation.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation uses the word ""antloobid"" (antelopes) which is not found in the machine translation.
4. Accuracy:
	* Machine translation: The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Virunga alal elavad ka elevandid"" as ""There are also elephants, paragraphs, shamblets, anti-foetuses and typical species living in the virtual area."" This is not a correct translation of the original Estonian sentence.
	* Reference translation: The reference translation accurately translates ""Virunga alal elavad ka elevandid"" as ""Elephants, lions, chimpanzees, antelopes and warts also live in the Virunga area.""

Based on these differences, it is clear that the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation. The machine translation makes several errors in word choice, grammar, and accuracy, while the reference translation provides a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the original Estonian sentence.

  Great, let's evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation. Here's my analysis of the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Word choice:
	* Machine translation: ""War on freedom"" vs. Reference translation: ""War of Independence""
		+ The machine translation uses the term ""war on freedom,"" which is not a common phrase in English. The reference translation uses ""War of Independence,"" which is a more accurate and common term to describe the Estonian War of Independence.
2. Tense consistency:
	* Machine translation: ""formally ended"" vs. Reference translation: ""formally ended only a month later""
		+ The machine translation uses the past tense ""ended"" to describe the formal ending of the war, while the reference translation uses the present perfect tense ""ended only a month later"" to indicate that the formal ending occurred in the past and has a lasting effect.
3. Word order:
	* Machine translation: ""Ametlikult lõppes Vabadussõda"" vs. Reference translation: ""The War of Independence""
		+ The machine translation places the word ""Ametlikult"" (meaning ""However"") at the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation places it after ""Vabadussõda"" (meaning ""War of Independence""). This difference in word order can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
4. Grammar:
	* Machine translation: ""Tartu rahu sõlmimisega"" vs. Reference translation: ""with the signing of the Tartu Peace""
		+ The machine translation uses the genitive case ""rahu"" (meaning ""peace"") to indicate possession, while the reference translation uses the prepositional phrase ""with the signing of the Tartu Peace"" to provide more context and clarity.
5. Idiomatic expressions:
	* Machine translation: ""2. veebruaril"" vs. Reference translation: ""on 2 February 1920""
		+ The machine translation uses the Estonian date format ""2. veebruaril"" (meaning ""on February 2nd""), while the reference translation uses the more common English date format ""on 2 February 1920.""

Based on these differences, it's clear that the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation provides more context and clarity, uses more common and accurate phrasing, and maintains consistency in tense and word order. Overall, the reference translation is a more reliable and high-quality translation of the Estonian text.

Machine Translation:

* ""If the answer is that Hilda wanted to ask Edgari for money"" should be ""If the answer is that Hilda wanted to inherit Edgar's money""
* ""taustteadmine sisaldab mõrvauurija tavalisi eeldusi motiivi"" should be ""the background knowledge contains the usual assumptions of a murder investigator about the motivation""
* ""vahendi ja võimaluse kohta"" should be ""the means and opportunity""

Reference Translation:

* ""If the answer is that Hilda wanted to inherit Edgar's money"" is a more accurate translation of the original Estonian sentence.
* ""the background knowledge contains the usual assumptions of a murder investigator about the motivation"" is a better translation of ""taustteadmine sisaldab mõrvauurija tavalisi eeldusi motiivi"" than ""the usual proposition of the murderer on the motivation, the tool and the possibility"".
* ""the means and opportunity"" is a more accurate translation of ""vahendi ja võimaluse kohta"" than ""the possibility"".

Overall, the machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original Estonian sentence as well as the reference translation. The machine translation changes the meaning of the sentence slightly, making it seem like the investigator is asking about the murderer's motivation for asking for money, rather than inheriting money. Additionally, the machine translation uses less formal language than the reference translation, which may not be suitable for a professional translation.

  As a helpful assistant, I will evaluate the quality of the Estonian-English translation provided in the source and compare it with the reference translation. Here are the differences I found:

1. Word choice: In the source translation, the word ""kellega"" is used instead of ""with whom"" in the reference translation. ""Kellega"" is an informal and colloquial term in Estonian, which may not be appropriate in formal or professional contexts.
2. Tense consistency: The source translation uses the present tense (""are worth discussing"") while the reference translation uses the past tense (""exist""). This inconsistency in tense can make the translation sound less natural and less accurate.
3. Word order: In the source translation, the phrase ""arutada eetikat"" is placed after the verb ""tasub,"" which is not the correct word order in Estonian. In Estonian, the verb typically comes before the object.
4. Idiomatic expressions: The source translation uses the phrase ""on kindlasti olemas,"" which is an idiomatic expression in Estonian. The reference translation does not use this phrase, which may make the translation sound less natural and less accurate.
5. Grammar: The source translation uses the accusative case for the noun ""eetikat"" (""ethics""), which is not necessary in Estonian. In Estonian, the noun ""eetikat"" is already in the accusative case, so the verb ""arutada"" can be placed directly after it without the need for the accusative case.

Based on these differences, I would rate the quality of the source translation as moderate, as it contains some errors and inaccuracies that can affect the overall clarity and naturalness of the translation. The reference translation, on the other hand, is of higher quality, as it uses more accurate and idiomatic expressions, and maintains consistent tense and word order.

Machine Translation:

* The sentence structure is slightly different, with the machine translation using a more straightforward and direct approach.
* The word order is also different, with the machine translation placing the verb ""imply"" before the subject ""issue"" instead of after it.
* The phrase ""moraalseid kaalutlusi"" is translated as ""moral considerations"" in the machine translation, but the reference translation uses the more literal translation ""moraalide kaalutused"".
* The word ""necessarily"" is translated differently in the two translations, with the machine translation using the word ""must"" instead of ""necessarily"".

Reference Translation:

* The sentence structure is similar in both translations, with the reference translation using a slightly more complex sentence structure.
* The word order is the same in both translations.
* The phrase ""moraalseid kaalutlusi"" is translated more literally in the reference translation, using the word ""moraalide"" instead of ""moral considerations"".
* The word ""necessarily"" is translated more accurately in the reference translation, using the word ""must"" instead of ""necessarily"".

Overall, the machine translation is more direct and straightforward, while the reference translation is more literal and accurate. The machine translation may be more suitable for informal or conversational contexts, while the reference translation is more appropriate for formal or academic contexts.

2. Word choice: The machine translation uses the word ""disease"" (in Estonian, ""sündmuskohal""), while the reference translation uses ""condition"" (in Estonian, ""seisundist""). This is a more common and natural way to express the idea in English.
3. Prepositions: The machine translation uses ""on the ground"" (in Estonian, ""maa alla""), while the reference translation uses ""regardless of the condition at high speed of transport"". This is a more natural way to express the idea in English, as it uses a more common preposition (""regardless of"") and a more descriptive phrase (""high speed of transport"").
4. Word order: The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, placing the verb ""seek"" at the end of the sentence. This is not a significant difference, but it can affect the rhythm and flow of the sentence.
5. Idiomatic expressions: The reference translation uses the idiomatic expression ""fast transport"" to convey the idea of quickly moving the patients to the emergency medical department.
