A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** හැම දැයෙහි මිදුණා වූ කසුප් බුදුරජුනට නමස්කාර වේ වා.

**Machine translation:** Every frost is named for the Ksupp Buddha.

**Reference translation:** Praise be to the Buddha who is saved in all things .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Conciseness:** The reference translation is more concise than the machine translation. The reference translation uses fewer words to convey the same message as the machine translation.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses more formal and poetic language than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more synonyms and antonyms to create a more vivid and evocative effect.
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation. The reference translation uses a variety of sentence structures to create a more flow and rhythm.
* **Cultural context:** The reference translation is more aware of the cultural context of the source text. The reference translation takes into account the Buddhist beliefs and practices that are referenced in the source text.
* **Tone:** The reference translation has a more reverent and praising tone than the machine translation. The reference translation expresses admiration and respect for the Buddha.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is not of high quality. The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways, including conciseness, word choice, sentence structure, cultural context, and tone. The machine translation is also less accurate and less readable than the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** උදාහරණයක් වශයෙන් කුඩා ළමයා තම ලිංගය ස්පර්ශ කිරීමට කැමතිය.

**Machine translation:** For example, the little kid likes to touch his dick.

**Reference translation:** For example , a small child likes to touch his penis .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""dick"" instead of ""penis."" This is a common error in machine translation, and it is often due to the fact that the machine translator does not have access to the same vocabulary as a human translator.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure. This is because the machine translator is not able to understand the nuances of the original text as well as a human translator.
* **Word order:** The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation. This is also due to the fact that the machine translator is not able to understand the nuances of the original text as well as a human translator.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The quality of the machine translation is poor. The machine translation is not able to capture the nuances of the original text, and it is also full of errors. The machine translation is not a good example of machine translation technology.

**Machine translation:**

In this way lectured intelligence on the menace, originally to come to pinnacle determination.

**Reference translation:**

Meditate on the Buddha Dhamma as preached in this manner to truly gain merit and attain Nirvana .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation lacks precision in its wording and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. For example, the phrase ""ආකාරයෙන් දේශනාකරන"" is translated as ""lectured intelligence"" which is not an accurate translation. The phrase should be translated as ""instructed in the Dhamma"" or ""taught the Dhamma.""
* **Lack of clarity:** The machine translation is not clear in its structure and organization. It does not follow the same structure as the source text and does not make it easy to understand.
* **Use of jargon:** The machine translation uses some jargon that is not understood by the average reader. For example, the phrase ""pinrasetzkara"" is not a word that is commonly used in English.
* **Lack of cultural sensitivity:** The machine translation does not show cultural sensitivity. It does not take into account the cultural context of the source text and does not translate the meaning of the text in a way that is appropriate for an English audience.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is not of high quality and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. It lacks precision, clarity, and cultural sensitivity. The reference translation is of much higher quality and is more accurate, clear, and culturally sensitive.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** 494දී එහි ශේෂයන් ගොගුර්යෝව විසින් අවශෝෂණය කරගන්නා ලදී.

**Machine translation:** In 494 its balance was absorbed by goguryeo.

**Reference translation:** In 494 its remnants were absorbed by Goguryeo .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

* **The machine translation uses the term ""balance"" instead of ""remnants.""** This is a semantic error, as the original text uses the term ""remnants,"" which refers to the remaining part of something that has been destroyed or taken away, while ""balance"" does not have the same meaning.
* **The machine translation does not include the phrase ""by Goguryeo.""** This is a grammatical error, as the original text includes the phrase ""by Goguryeo,"" which specifies the agent of the action.
* **The machine translation does not use the same word order as the original text.** The original text follows the order of subject, verb, object, modifier, while the machine translation follows the order of subject, verb, modifier, object.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is of poor quality. It contains several semantic and grammatical errors, and it does not accurately capture the meaning of the original text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the original text. It is full of errors and does not accurately capture the meaning of the original text. The reference translation is a much better translation, as it is more accurate, grammatically correct, and semantically appropriate.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Machine translation:** By contrast with the royal yi house, the Andong Kim clan had contested hundreds of power.

**Reference translation:** The Andong Kim dynasty had strengthened its power by intermarrying with the royal house .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation, removing the phrase ""by intermarrying"" and condensing the sentence into a single sentence.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""contested"" instead of ""strengthened,"" which is more appropriate in the context of the sentence.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation, with a contrasting clause and a participial phrase.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence, placing the adverb ""by contrast"" at the beginning.

**Reference translation:**

* **Completeness:** The reference translation is more complete than the machine translation, providing additional details about the intermarrying and the strengthening of power.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses more precise words, such as ""intermarrying"" and ""strengthened.""
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure, with a compound predicate and a participial phrase.
* **Word order:** The reference translation follows a more traditional word order, with the subject, verb, and object in the correct order.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written, but it lacks the completeness and precision of the reference translation. The conciseness and word choice are good, but the sentence structure and word order are not ideal. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved.

""එහි පරාජය කෙරුණු සතුරන්ගේ රූ සහිත දර්ශනවලින් අලංකාර කර ඇත.""

**2. Read the machine translation:**

""Its defeated enemy is portrayed with ruined scenes.""

**3. Read the reference translation:**

""It is adorned with pictures of defeated enemies.""

**Analysis:**

The machine translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text, but it does not preserve the style and rhythm of the original language. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text in terms of style and rhythm, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text in some places.

**Specific differences:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""defeated"" instead of ""vanished"" or ""subdued"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure than the reference translation.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence compared to the reference translation.
* **Rhythm:** The machine translation does not have the same rhythm as the original text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not preserve the style and rhythm of the original language as well as the reference translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text in terms of style and rhythm, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text in some places.

**Conclusion:**

The best translation for this text would be a hybrid of the machine translation and the reference translation. It would preserve the style and rhythm of the original text while also capturing the exact meaning of the source text.

## Quality Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** ලොව කිසිම පුද්ගලයකුට තමා වයසට යාම නතර කිරීමට ශක්තියක් නැත.

**Machine Translation:** No person in the world has the strength to stop aging.

**Reference Translation:** No one in the world has the power to stop aging.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""strength"" instead of ""power."" This is a semantic error, as ""strength"" is not synonymous with ""power.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""stop"" instead of ""prevent"" or ""slow down."" This is a lexical error, as ""stop"" is not the most appropriate word to use in this context.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text significantly. The source text is a single sentence, while the machine translation splits the sentence into two sentences.
    * The machine translation uses a more formal tone than the source text. The source text is written in a more conversational tone.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It has several errors in word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The translation is also not very faithful to the original text.

**Step 4: Recommendations for improvement.**

To improve the quality of the translation, the following steps could be taken:

* Use a more accurate translation tool.
* Use a more comprehensive dictionary and thesaurus.
* Use a more detailed grammar and syntax checker.
* Use a native English speaker to review the translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation

**Source:**

මෙසේ තාවකාලිකව යටපත් කරන්නා වූ දේවල් අවිඥානය තුළ සැගවී තිබේ.

**Machine translation:**

Table of contemporary undertakings is hidden in arithmetic.

**Reference translation:**

Things that are thus temporarily suppressed are hidden in the awichnaya.

## Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation

**Machine translation:**

* **Lack of context:** The machine translation does not provide any context about the word ""contemporary"" or the phrase ""table of undertakings.""
* **Misinterpretation:** The machine translation interprets the word ""yටපත්"" as ""arithmetic"" instead of ""hidden.""
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has several grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the word ""is"" and the incorrect placement of the phrase ""is hidden.""

**Reference translation:**

* **Clearer and more concise:** The reference translation is clearer and more concise than the machine translation.
* **Contextualization:** The reference translation provides more context about the word ""awichnaya"" and the phrase ""things that are thus temporarily suppressed.""
* **Accurate translation:** The reference translation accurately translates the meaning of the source text.

## Conclusion

The machine translation is not of high quality due to its lack of context, misinterpretation, and grammatical errors. The reference translation is of much higher quality as it is clearer, more concise, and more accurate.

**Machine translation:** Although an economic crisis could emerge with problematic political conditions, the panths did not definitely escape from their chronic leadership.

**Reference translation:** While an economic crisis can create problematic political situations , a situation in which the classes lose their traditional leadership does not inevitably arise .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Conciseness:**
- The source text is more concise than the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation adds unnecessary phrases like ""could emerge"" and ""with problematic political conditions.""
- The reference translation is more concise and to the point.

**2. Word choice:**
- The source text uses more formal language, while the machine translation and the reference translation use more conversational language.
- The machine translation uses more colloquial language, such as ""panths"" and ""chronic leadership.""
- The reference translation uses more precise and formal language, such as ""classes"" and ""traditional leadership.""

**3. Sentence structure:**
- The source text has a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation has a more simple sentence structure, with fewer clauses and conjunctions.
- The reference translation has a more complex sentence structure, with more clauses and conjunctions.

**4. Focus:**
- The source text focuses on the loss of traditional leadership and its potential impact on the economic crisis.
- The machine translation focuses on the potential economic crisis and the loss of traditional leadership.
- The reference translation focuses on the potential loss of traditional leadership and its impact on the classes.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality:**

The machine translation is well-written and conveys the main idea of the source text, but it lacks the conciseness, precision and focus of the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text, but it may be too verbose and complex for some readers.

**Overall, the quality of the Sinhala-English translation depends on the specific needs of the reader.** If the reader needs a concise and accurate translation, the reference translation may be more suitable. If the reader needs a more conversational and easier-to-read translation, the machine translation may be more suitable.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Sinhala-English translation

**1. Read the source:**

The source text is in Sinhala and describes a situation where someone is discussing the establishment of trade relations with Western nations and the potential for acquiring Western technology.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is in English and captures the main points of the source text, but it does not preserve the exact wording and structure. The translation is also missing some of the nuances of the original text, such as the use of the phrase ""trade relations"" and the phrase ""Western technology should also be acquired.""

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate translation of the source text. It preserves the exact wording and structure of the original text, and it also captures the nuances of the original text.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""commercial contact"" instead of ""trade relations."" This is a more general term that does not capture the specific meaning of the word ""trade relations.""
* **Structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the original text. The original text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure.
* **Nuances:** The machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original text, such as the use of the phrase ""Western technology should also be acquired."" This phrase is important because it highlights the idea that the speaker is not only interested in establishing trade relations with Western nations, but also in acquiring their technology.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good summary of the source text, but it does not preserve the exact wording and structure of the original text. The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text. It preserves the exact wording and structure of the original text, and it also captures the nuances of the original text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Reading the source, machine translation and reference translation:**

**Source:** ඒ අවබෝධය ඇතිව ඉන්ද්රිකය සංවර කරගෙන සියලු සත්වයෝ දුකින් මිදෙත්වා නිවන් ලබත්වා යයි තමාට නොව බාහිරව මෙත්තාව පතුරුවමින් මෙත්තාවෙන් අප්රතතමාණයට යන්න.

**Machine translation:** With that perception, the Indian encounters all creatures who are saddened and will not be spreading the dominant method.

**Reference translation:** With that realization , tame the senses and spread good will of let no living beings suffer and will be freed from sorrow and attain Nibbana .

**Step 2: Identifying differences between machine translation and reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""encounter"" instead of ""meet"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""dominant method"" instead of ""good will"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to a more concise form.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""let no living beings suffer"" from the source text.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase "" attain Nibbana"" from the source text.
* **Tone:**
    * The machine translation has a more neutral tone than the reference translation.
    * The reference translation has a more uplifting and optimistic tone.

**Step 3: Evaluating the quality of the machine translation:**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the full meaning of the source text. The machine translation is also lacking in creativity and originality.

**Step 4: Recommendations:**

To improve the quality of the machine translation, the translator could:

* Use more precise word choice.
* Include more of the details from the source text.
* Use a more similar sentence structure to the source text.
* Use a more uplifting and optimistic tone.

## Quality Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is a simple sentence describing the feeling of sadness when a body is formed through entering into a womb filled with feces and excrement. The language is concise and direct, using strong verbs like ""හදාගත්"" and ""බැසගෙන.""

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The translation is grammatically correct and uses synonyms for the original text, but the meaning is not entirely clear. The phrase ""When the unconscious dead descends into a mouse"" is particularly confusing and does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The translation is more accurate and closer to the original text. It uses more precise language and clearly states the cause of sadness.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the cause of sadness, whereas the reference translation states that the sadness is caused by the formation of a body through entering into a womb filled with feces and excrement.
* **Unclear phrasing:** The phrase ""When the unconscious dead descends into a mouse"" is not only grammatically incorrect but also does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text.
* **Use of synonyms:** The machine translation uses synonyms for the original text, but the meaning is not always the same. For example, the word ""firm"" is not synonymous with ""institutes.""
* **Lack of cultural understanding:** The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the original text. In Sri Lanka, the concept of entering into a womb filled with feces and excrement is considered to be taboo and is not commonly discussed.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not of good quality and does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The reference translation is much closer to the original text and is more accurate and precise.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Quality Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Reading the Source Text**

The source text is a description of Thutmose's paintings found in a tomb. It uses vivid imagery and employs the use of the word ""dimensions"" to describe the new perspectives offered by Thutmose's work.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Machine Translation**

The machine translation accurately summarizes the source text, but it lacks the precision and elegance of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""instead of"" to contrast the colored cathedral with the oldest tombs is a good translation, but the phrase ""found in his era"" is not as precise as ""found in place of"" in the reference translation.

**Step 3: Analyzing the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is well-written and captures the essence of the source text. It uses precise language and employs the use of vivid imagery to create a clear and accurate picture in the reader's mind.

**Areas where the Machine Translation differs from the Reference Translation:**

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the location of the tombs, while the reference translation states ""in place of.""
* **Lack of elegance:** The machine translation uses simpler language and lacks the poetic flow of the reference translation.
* **Inaccurate use of phraseology:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""instead of"" to contrast the colored cathedral with the oldest tombs, which is not as precise as the reference translation's ""found in place of.""

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good summary of the source text, but it lacks the precision and elegance of the reference translation. The reference translation is a more accurate and well-written translation that captures the essence of the source text more effectively.

## Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is in Sinhala and describes a location. It uses specific anatomical terms related to the heart.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The translation is concise and uses the correct terminology for the heart chambers. However, it does not capture the exact location of the described structure. It incorrectly states that the location is on the border between the southern karma lower karma and the southern karma cosica.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is accurate and clearly states the location of the structure as the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle in the lower atrium of the right atrium.

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Misinterpretation of anatomical terms:** The machine translation incorrectly uses the term ""karma"" instead of the correct anatomical terms ""atrium"" and ""ventricles.""
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the exact location of the structure within the heart chambers, instead stating a general location on the border between the southern karma lower karma and the southern karma cosica.

## Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is a statement about the post-war acquisition of Germany by the Soviet Union. It is clear, concise, and to the point.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the source text. The sentence structure is different, and the use of some words is not idiomatic.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the source text. It uses the same sentence structure and uses more precise language.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the source text and the reference translation. The source text uses a complex sentence structure with a lot of clauses and participles. The machine translation simplifies the sentence structure and loses some of the nuance of the original text.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the source text and the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the word ""acquisition"" instead of ""acquisition"" and ""came to an effect"" instead of ""would go to war.""
* **Precision:** The machine translation is not as precise as the source text and the reference translation. For example, the machine translation does not specify the ""wars against Germany"" or the ""Soviet Union coming to an effect.""
* **Idiom:** The machine translation does not use idiomatic language like the source text and the reference translation. For example, the source text uses the idiom ""when the Soviet Union would go to war against Germany"" which is not used in the machine translation.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the source text and the reference translation. The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are the sentence structure, word choice, precision, and idiom.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** දැඩි ශීතයට අනුවර්තනය වීමට සතුන්ගේ ශරිරයේ ලොම් බහුල වී ඇත.

**Machine translation:** The body of animals has multiple wools to adapt to harsh winter.

**Reference translation:** The body of animals have abundant amounts of fur to adapt to harsh winter .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""multiple wools"" instead of ""abundant amounts of fur.""
* Omits the phrase ""to adapt to harsh winter.""
* Does not specify the body part (""ශරිරය"") where the fur is abundant.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""abundant amounts of fur"" to describe the amount of fur.
* Specifies the body part (""ශරිරය"") where the fur is abundant.
* Includes the phrase ""to adapt to harsh winter"" to explain the purpose of the fur.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to understand, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""multiple wools"" is not appropriate in this context, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The omission of the phrase ""to adapt to harsh winter"" is also a significant deviation from the reference translation. Overall, the machine translation is a good attempt to translate the source text, but it could be improved by being more precise and accurate.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is well-written and accurate, but it could be improved by being more concise and clear. The use of the phrase ""abundant amounts of fur"" is a bit redundant, as the word ""fur"" is already used in the phrase ""body of animals."" The inclusion of the phrase ""to adapt to harsh winter"" is also unnecessary, as it is already implied in the text. Overall, the reference translation is a good translation of the source text, but it could be improved by being more concise and clear.

**Reference translation:** Therefore , they add this to the name of the Prophet and mention it .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Lack of explanation:** The machine translation does not explain why the Prophet's name is being added to the text.
* **Use of colloquial language:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""so add"" which is a colloquial expression, while the reference translation uses more formal language such as ""therefore"" and ""add.""
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the Prophet's name, while the reference translation specifies the Prophet's name as ""the Prophet.""
* **Use of different sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation.
* **Lack of cultural understanding:** The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the text, while the reference translation does.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is not of high quality because it lacks explanation, uses colloquial language, lacks precision, uses a different sentence structure, and does not take into account the cultural context of the text. The reference translation is of higher quality because it explains the reason for adding the Prophet's name, uses more formal language, is more precise, uses a more appropriate sentence structure, and takes into account the cultural context of the text.

## Quality Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** ඔහුට එක් ම නමක් ඇති පුතුන් ද බොහෝ ඇතැ යි මා විසින් අසන ලදී.

**Machine translation:** He has a lot of sons with one name and was heard by me.

**Reference translation:** I asked him if he had many sons with the same name .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It combines the two sentences of the source text into one sentence.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, ""නමක්"" is translated as ""one name,"" while ""මා විසින්"" is translated as ""was heard by me.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a question structure, while the machine translation uses a declarative structure.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the source text. For example, ""ඔහුට එක් ම නමක් ඇති"" is translated as ""He has a lot of sons with one name.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The conciseness and the use of different words and sentence structure make the translation difficult to understand. The change in word order also makes the translation difficult to read.

**Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it is not perfect.** It is a good example of the challenges of translating languages.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Machine translation:** Once Huan and zhong jing did not oppose the chang brothers, the emperor entrusted zhong to investigate this.

**Reference translation:** After Huan and Song Jing made various accusations against the Chang brothers , the empress commissioned Song to investigate .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

* **Order of events:** The machine translation follows a different order of events than the reference translation. In the machine translation, the sentence ""Once Huan and zhong jing did not oppose the chang brothers"" is moved to the beginning of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is moved to the end.
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. The reference translation uses more words to convey the same information as the machine translation.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the word ""emperor"" instead of ""empress.""
* **Syntax:** The machine translation uses a different syntax than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is not of high quality. It is different from the reference translation in a number of ways, including the order of events, conciseness, word choice, and syntax.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Sinhala-English translation

**1. Read the source:**

The source text is in Sinhala and describes a belief held by a person about the nature of the universe. It states that all arms of the universe are made of physical matter that we know.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation accurately captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not include the nuance and precision of the reference translation. The phrase ""according to his idea"" is a good translation of the Sinhala phrase ""ඒ අනුව"" which emphasizes the source of the idea. However, the phrase ""immune from the physical matter"" is not a perfect translation of the Sinhala phrase ""භෞතික පදාර්ථයෙන් නිර්මිත බව"". The Sinhala phrase is more precise and states that the arms of the universe are not simply immune to physical matter, but rather made of it.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is a more accurate and nuanced translation of the source text. It uses the phrase ""accordingly"" to convey the same meaning as the Sinhala phrase ""ඒ අනුව"". The phrase ""made of the physical matter we know"" is a precise translation of the Sinhala phrase ""භෞතික පදාර්ථයෙන් නිර්මිත බව"".

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good overall translation of the source text, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The reference translation is a more accurate and nuanced translation that captures the exact meaning of the source text.

**Source:** Iවන පරන්තක සහ IIවන පරන්තක චෝළ ශිව සහ විෂ්ණු වෙනුවෙන් දේවාල ඉදිකොට ඇත.

**Machine translation:** The Temples are built for Shiva and vishnu.

**Reference translation:** The Parantaka I and Parantaka the II Cholas built temples for Shiva and Vishnu .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

**Machine translation:**
* Omits the phrase ""Parantaka I and Parantaka the II Cholas""
* Does not mention the location of the temples (""Ivan Parantaka"")
* Does not specify the purpose of the temples (""for Shiva and vishnu"")

**Reference translation:**
* Includes the phrase ""Parantaka I and Parantaka the II Cholas""
* Mentions the location of the temples (""Ivan Parantaka"")
* Specifies the purpose of the temples (""for Shiva and Vishnu"")

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation**

The machine translation is poor quality as it fails to capture the nuances of the original text. It lacks accuracy, precision and fluency. The translation is also missing important information, such as the location and purpose of the temples.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation**

The reference translation is of high quality as it accurately and precisely translates the original text. It is also fluent and well-written. The translation includes all the important information, such as the location and purpose of the temples.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is of poor quality, while the reference translation is of high quality. The machine translation fails to capture the nuances of the original text and lacks accuracy, precision and fluency. The reference translation, on the other hand, accurately and precisely translates the original text and includes all the important information.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Machine Translation:**

The Highland Institute specializes in cargo parasitism that does not reach a percentage cost.

**Reference Translation:**

The specialty of Highland is that there is no response cost even if the item is split .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""parasitism"" which is a strong and negative word.
    * The reference translation uses the word ""response cost"" which is a more neutral word.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a complex sentence structure with a lot of jargon.
    * The reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with more clear and concise language.
* **Meaning:**
    * The machine translation does not capture the meaning of the source text accurately.
    * The reference translation captures the meaning of the source text more accurately.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not of good quality and does not accurately capture the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is of better quality and captures the meaning of the source text more accurately.

**Recommendations:**

The machine translation should be improved to use more accurate word choice, simpler sentence structure, and more clear and concise language. The reference translation should be used as the preferred translation for this text.

## Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:**

මෙයට විරුද්ධ තර්කයන් ඉදිරිපත් කළ 11 වැනි සියවසෙහි විසු දේවධර්මධරයෙකු වන අබු හමීඩ් අල් ගසාලි, අවසානයේදී ජය ගත්තේය.

**Machine translation:**

The opposite arguments to this were presented in the 11th century by a judge, Abu Hamid Al Ghazali, who finally won.

**Reference translation:**

Abu Hameed al-Ghazali , an 11th-century theologian who argued the opposite , eventually won .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It combines the first two sentences of the reference translation into one sentence.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, ""arguments"" is used instead of ""opposite arguments,"" and ""judge"" is used instead of ""theologian.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a complex sentence structure with a subordinate clause, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""who finally won"" is moved to the end of the sentence in the machine translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text.

## Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text**

The text is in Sinhala and describes the re-engraving of monuments for the daughters of Akhnaten.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and accurately summarizes the source text, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the original text.

**Key differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:**

* **The machine translation uses the phrase ""descendants of later akhnaten's daughters"" instead of ""later re-engraved for Akinatan 's daughters.""** This phrase is not in the original text and is not a precise translation of the original text.
* **The machine translation uses the phrase ""cathedral"" instead of ""monument.""** The word ""cathedral"" is not in the original text and is not a precise translation of the original text.
* **The machine translation does not mention the queen.** The original text mentions the queen, but the machine translation does not.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate translation of the original text than the machine translation.

**Key similarities between the reference translation and the original text:**

* **The reference translation uses the same phrase as the original text ""originally made for the queen were later re-engraved for Akinatan 's daughters.""**
* **The reference translation uses the same word as the original text ""monument.""**
* **The reference translation mentions the queen.**

**Step 4: Conclusion**

The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the original text than the machine translation. The machine translation is not able to capture the exact meaning of the original text due to its use of inaccurate phrases and the omission of important information.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** නමුත් 14වන සියවසේ මැද භාගය වන විට, යුවාන් රාජවංශය බිඳ වැටෙමින් පැවතිණි.

**Machine translation:** But by the middle of the 14th century, the Yuan dynasty was falling.

**Reference translation:** But by the middle of the 14th century , the Yuan dynasty was collapsing .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""falling"" instead of ""collapsing.""
    * The reference translation uses the word ""collapsing"" to emphasize the severity of the situation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure.
    * The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure to convey the same information in a more concise manner.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation follows a different word order than the reference translation.
    * The reference translation follows a more logical order of words.
* **Conciseness:**
    * The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation.
    * The reference translation is more verbose and uses more words to convey the same information.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is generally accurate but lacks the precision and elegance of the reference translation. The word choice, sentence structure, and word order are all different from the reference translation. While the machine translation is able to convey the main idea of the source text, it does not capture the nuances and subtleties of the original language.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good approximation of the source text, but it does not match the quality of the reference translation. The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are in word choice, sentence structure, word order, and conciseness.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
## Step-by-step evaluation of Sinhala-English translation

**1. Read the source:**

The source text is in Sinhala and reads: ""එහෙත් මෙම වෙනස්කම් පලස්තන රජය විසින් අනුමත කරනු ලැබුවේ නැත.""

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is in English and reads: ""But these changes were not approved by the Palestinian government.""

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is in English and reads: ""But these changes were not approved by the Palestinian government.""

**4. Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""changes"" while the reference translation uses ""these changes."" This is a minor difference in word choice that does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure with a compound predicate, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with a compound predicate and a participial phrase. This difference in sentence structure is due to the different grammatical rules between Sinhala and English.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""were not approved"" are placed after the phrase ""by the Palestinian government,"" while in the reference translation, they are placed after the phrase ""by the Palestinian government."" This is a minor difference in word order that does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.
* **Punctuation:**
    * The machine translation uses different punctuation than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a period after the phrase ""government,"" while the reference translation uses a period after the phrase ""government."" This is a minor difference in punctuation that does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.

**Overall, the machine translation is very similar to the reference translation.** The only differences are minor differences in word choice, sentence structure, word order, and punctuation. These differences do not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** ඔහුට එරෙහි කැරැල්ලක් නිසා 1916 මාර්තු මස යුවාන්ට බලය අත්හැරීමට සිදු වූ අතර එම වසරේ ජූනි මස ඔහු මියගියේ ය.

**Machine translation:** Due to a rebellion against him in March 1916 Yuan had to give up power and he died in June of that year.

**Reference translation:** A revolt against him forced Juan to relinquish power in March 1916 , and he died in June of that year .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

* **Use of different pronouns:** The machine translation uses the pronoun ""Yuan"" while the reference translation uses the pronoun ""Juan.""
* **Use of different verb tenses:** The machine translation uses the past tense ""had to give up"" while the reference translation uses the past tense ""forced"" and ""relinquished.""
* **Use of different word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""rebellion"" while the reference translation uses the word "" revolt.""
* **Lack of specificity:** The machine translation does not specify the location of the rebellion, while the reference translation specifies the location as ""against him.""
* **Lack of conjunction:** The machine translation does not use the conjunction ""that"" after ""rebellion,"" while the reference translation uses the conjunction ""that.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks some of the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The use of different pronouns, verb tenses, and word choice can be confusing for some readers. The lack of specificity and conjunction can also make the translation difficult to understand. Overall, the machine translation is a good starting point for a translation, but it would need to be revised to improve its accuracy and precision.

**Machine translation:**

Most of these documents include the political purpose of writing a poem about hundreds of dead mothers who were unable to see revisions of grievances.

**Reference translation:**

Many of these documents were written for political purposes , but there is also a poem written with the sadness of not being able to see his dead mother again .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""documents"" instead of ""documents"" in the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the context of the sentence as well as the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the complex sentence structure of the source text.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of words in the sentence. This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the word order of the source text.
* **Tone:** The machine translation has a more formal tone than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the tone of the source text.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways. These differences are due to the machine translation's inability to understand the context of the sentence, the complex sentence structure of the source text, the word order of the source text, and the tone of the source text.

## Quality Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

**Source:** කිරිගොවීන් 70000 ක් පමණ සමස්ථ නිෂ්පාදනයට කිරි සැපයීමත් සිදුකරයි.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

**Machine translation:** About 70000 milkgoers are also providing milk to the entire product.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

**Reference translation:** It also supplies milk to about 70,000 dairy farmers for total production.

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""milkgoers"" instead of ""dairy farmers."" This is not a precise translation, as ""milkgoers"" does not specifically refer to dairy farmers.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""product"" instead of ""total production."" This is also not a precise translation, as the product could refer to any product, not just milk.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a compound sentence to describe the two actions of supplying milk and producing total production. The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure to combine these two actions.
* **Conciseness:**
    * The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. The reference translation uses more words to say the same thing as the machine translation.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not a very accurate translation of the source text. It is different in terms of word choice, sentence structure, and conciseness. The reference translation is a more accurate translation, as it uses more precise language and a more complete sentence structure.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Sinhala-English translation

**1. Read the source:**

The source text is a quote in Sinhala that translates to ""Only when so satisfied is it realized that true satisfaction is not.""

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is ""The real satisfaction is that the soil is not only satisfactory but also satisfactory.""

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is ""Only when so satisfied is it realized that true satisfaction is not.""

**Analysis:**

The machine translation captures the literal meaning of the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original language. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text, as it uses similar phrasing and vocabulary to the source text.

**Specific differences:**

* **The machine translation uses the phrase ""real satisfaction"" instead of ""true satisfaction.""** This phrase is not equivalent to the original phrase ""මහතාව තෘප්තිය"" which means ""true satisfaction.""
* **The machine translation uses the phrase ""soil is satisfactory"" instead of ""it is realized that true satisfaction is not.""** This phrase is not equivalent to the original phrase ""මහතාව තෘප්තිය එය නොවන බව"" which means ""only when so satisfied is it realized that true satisfaction is not.""
* **The machine translation does not use the same vocabulary as the original text.** For example, the original text uses the word ""පසක්"" which means ""very"" and ""වන්නේ"" which means ""that."" The machine translation does not use these words.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original language. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text, as it uses similar phrasing and vocabulary to the source text.

**Source text:**
56 වන වගන්තියට අනුව ගොවිකාරක සභාවට කුඹුරු අනිවාර්යෙන්ම අත්කර ගැනීම ද සිදු කර ගත හැකිය.

**Machine translation:**
According to section 56, the fields to the farmer s ' Council can be definitely acquired.

**Reference translation:**
According to Article 56 , the Farmers ' Council can also acquire paddy lands compulsorily .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

* **Use of terminology:** The machine translation uses the term ""section"" instead of ""Article.""
* **Use of verb tense:** The machine translation uses the present tense, while the reference translation uses the future tense.
* **Use of conjunction:** The machine translation uses the conjunction ""can be definitely acquired"" to connect the two sentences, while the reference translation uses the conjunction ""also"" to connect the two sentences.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""fields"" instead of ""paddy lands.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a simpler sentence structure, while the reference translation has a more complex sentence structure.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some differences from the reference translation. The use of different terminology, verb tense, conjunction, and word choice can all affect the quality of the translation. The simpler sentence structure of the machine translation may also make it easier to read and understand, but it may not be as precise as the more complex sentence structure of the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does have some differences from the reference translation. These differences are primarily due to the use of different terminology, verb tense, conjunction, and word choice. The machine translation is generally accurate, but it may not be as precise as the reference translation.

**Machine translation:** Then when the difference in the two Shia and supreme religions is taken, it dates to a very far history.

**Reference translation:** That is , the difference between the two Shia and Sunni religions goes back a long way .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""two Shia and supreme religions"" instead of ""two Shia and Sunni religions.""
* Does not use the phrase ""that is"" to clarify the relationship between the two sentences.
* Does not use the phrase ""goes back a long way"" to describe the time frame.
* Uses the phrase ""dates to a very far history"" instead of ""goes back a long way.""

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""two Shia and Sunni religions"" to specify the two religions.
* Uses the phrase ""that is"" to clarify the relationship between the two sentences.
* Uses the phrase ""goes back a long way"" to describe the time frame.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some differences from the reference translation. The most significant difference is the use of different phrases to describe the same concepts. For example, the machine translation uses the phrase ""two Shia and supreme religions"" instead of ""two Shia and Sunni religions."" This phrase is not as accurate as the reference translation, as it does not correctly specify the two religions.

The machine translation also does not use the phrase ""that is"" to clarify the relationship between the two sentences. This phrase is important for clarity, as it helps to explain the connection between the two sentences.

Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it does have some differences from the reference translation. These differences are primarily due to the use of different phrases to describe the same concepts.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Use of synonyms:** ""Rather than"" and ""various kinds"" are synonyms of ""compared to"" and ""a variety of"" in the reference translation.
* **Different sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation.
* **Lack of comparison:** The machine translation does not explicitly compare the salad plant to Western countries.
* **Focus on taxonomy:** The machine translation focuses primarily on the use of the salad plant for food taxonomy, while the reference translation focuses on the use of the salad plant for a variety of dishes.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the translation.**

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The source text is a short sentence in Sinhala that describes a pamphlet discovered by the protagonist. The text is clear and concise, but lacks detail and precision.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation attempts to capture the meaning of the source text, but the language is awkward and the sentence structure is not well-formed. The translation also lacks precision and fails to capture the nuances of the original text.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is much closer to the original text in terms of language and structure. The translation is also more precise and uses more vivid language.

**Analysis of differences:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""lagrange"" instead of ""pamphlet"" and ""keyword"" instead of ""handwriting.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure, which is not necessary for the content of the text.
* **Precision:** The machine translation lacks precision and fails to capture the nuances of the original text. The reference translation is more precise and captures the nuances of the original text more accurately.
* **Language:** The machine translation uses awkward language and the sentence structure is not well-formed. The reference translation uses more natural and flowing language.

## Quality Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Reading the source, machine translation and reference translation**

**Source:** ඉන් මාසයකට පසු IVවන අමෙන්හොටෙප් සිය නාමය අක්නාටන් ලෙස නිල වශයෙන් වෙනස් කොට ගත්තේ ය.

**Machine translation:** A month after that, IV's amenhotep took the name akhnaaton when it was officially changed.

**Reference translation:** A month later , Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Aknatan .

**Step 2: Identifying differences between machine translation and reference translation**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation, removing the phrase ""later"" and using the phrase ""after that"" instead.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""amenhotep"" instead of ""Amenhotep IV"" and the word ""akhnaaton"" instead of ""Aknatan.""
* **Syntax:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, using a different verb tense and rearranging the sentence elements.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words ""after that"" and ""officially.""

**Reference translation:**

* **Precision:** The reference translation is more precise than the machine translation, using the specific phrase ""later"" and mentioning ""Amenhotep IV"" and ""Aknatan.""
* **Formal tone:** The reference translation has a more formal tone than the machine translation, using more formal language and avoiding contractions.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses more formal words, such as ""officially"" and ""name.""
* **Syntax:** The reference translation follows a more traditional sentence structure and uses more complex sentence construction.

**Step 3: Evaluation**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it loses some of the precision and formality of the reference translation. The main differences are in the word choice, syntax and word order.

**Reference Translation:** To be one with all the powers , including to create , to destroy , to revive , to revive , to destroy superiority , to inferiority .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses more formal and technical language than the reference translation. For example, ""ඇති කිරීම"" is translated as ""creation"" in the machine translation, but ""create"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the reference translation. For example, the sentence ""ඇති කිරීමද, නැති කිරීමද, පණ දීම"" is translated as a single sentence in the machine translation, but it is broken up into several sentences in the reference translation.
* **Word order:** The machine translation follows a more literal word order than the reference translation. For example, the sentence ""උසස්භාවය නැති කිරීම"" is translated as ""superiority is destruction"" in the machine translation, but it is translated as ""destruction of superiority"" in the reference translation.
* **Style:** The machine translation is more formal and less conversational than the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is well-translated, but it does have some differences from the reference translation. The main differences are in the word choice, sentence structure, word order, and style. These differences are not necessarily detrimental to the overall quality of the translation, but they could be improved.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:**

මේ යුගයේ විසූ විද්වතුන් අතර වරාහමිහිර සහ ආර්යභට වැනි විද්වතුන් වැදගත් වේ.

**Machine translation:**

Among the disconnected scientists of this era are important scientists such as portrayal and aryan.

**Reference translation:**

Among the scholars who lived in this period , scholars like Varahamihira and Aryabhata are important .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

* **Use of terminology:** The machine translation uses the term ""scientists"" instead of ""scholars"" in the reference translation. This is because the machine translation does not have the same context as the reference translation, and therefore uses a more general term.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""portray"" instead of ""Varahamihira"" and ""aryan"" instead of ""Aryabhata."" This is because the machine translation is not able to find exact translations for these words, and therefore uses synonyms that are similar in meaning.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is not able to reproduce the exact sentence structure of the source text, and therefore uses a different structure that is more suitable for English.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is different from the reference translation in several ways, including the use of terminology, word choice, and sentence structure. The machine translation is also not able to capture the nuances of the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a good quality translation of the source text. It is different from the reference translation in many ways, and it is not able to capture the nuances of the source text.

## Quality Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The source text is in Sinhala and describes the action of sending signals on a touchscreen. It uses the phrase ""ස්පර්ශක සංවේදක තිරය"" which translates to ""touch sensor screen.""

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is in English and accurately translates the source text, but it uses the phrase ""touchs"" instead of ""several touches"" to match the exact wording in the source text.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is in English and accurately translates the source text, but it uses more formal language than the machine translation.

**Analysis of differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""touchs"" instead of ""several touches"" to match the exact wording in the source text.
    * The reference translation uses more formal language, such as ""signals"" and ""touch sensor screen.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation has a simpler sentence structure than the source text and the reference translation.
    * The reference translation has a more complex sentence structure, with a longer clause and a more formal tone.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it could be improved by using more precise wording and a more similar sentence structure to the reference translation.

**Recommendations:**

* The machine translation could be improved by using more precise wording, such as ""several touches"" instead of ""touchs.""
* The machine translation could be improved by using a more similar sentence structure to the reference translation.
* The machine translation could be improved by using a more formal tone, similar to the reference translation.

**Machine translation:** It is therefore not suitable for treating alcohol with separate isolated lake only that influenced.

**Reference translation:** Therefore it is not advisable to treat the affected fish alone in a separate isolation tank .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""alcohol"" instead of ""fish"" in the second sentence. This is not a direct translation and does not match the meaning of the source text.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""lake"" instead of ""tank"" in the second sentence. This is also not a direct translation and does not match the meaning of the source text.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text in the second sentence. The source text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""that influenced"" to the end of the second sentence. This is not a natural English phrasing and does not match the structure of the source text.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the second sentence. The source text has the order ""fish, alone, tank"". The machine translation has the order ""fish, alone, in a separate tank"".

**Reference translation:** The Yuhu aristocracy was exiled to Babylon and is considered to be the first Jewish diaspora .

## Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation

**Key differences:**

* **Subject:** The source text uses the term ""යුහු ප්රභූව"" (Yuhu aristocracy) while the machine translation uses ""Eu Codex"" and the reference translation uses ""Yuhu aristocracy"".
* **Verb tense:** The source text uses the past tense ""පිටුවහල්"" (exiled) while the machine translation uses the past tense ""was exiled"" and the reference translation also uses the past tense ""was exiled"".
* **Word choice:** The source text uses the word ""පළමු"" (first) while the machine translation uses ""this first"" and the reference translation also uses ""first"".
* **Word order:** The source text follows a different word order than the machine translation and the reference translation.

## Conclusion

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including the subject, verb tense, word choice, and word order. These differences are due to the different ways in which the two languages structure sentences and convey the same information.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Reference Translation:** He also encouraged the construction of a number of tombs for the aristocracy.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Conciseness:** The reference translation is more concise than the machine translation. The reference translation uses the phrase ""He also encouraged"" to combine the first two sentences of the source text, while the machine translation does not.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses more formal language than the machine translation. For example, the reference translation uses the word ""aristocracy"" while the machine translation uses the word ""noblemen.""
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation. The reference translation uses a compound sentence to combine the first two sentences of the source text, while the machine translation uses two separate sentences.
* **Word order:** The reference translation changes the order of the words in the source text. For example, the reference translation moves the phrase ""for the aristocracy"" to the end of the sentence, while the machine translation keeps it in the same position.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the translation.**

The quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
## Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is in Sinhala and describes rooms in a rural peasant house. It uses the phrase ""ගැමි සුළු ගොවින්ගේ නිවෙස්වල බහු කාර්ය කාමර"" which translates to ""unlike the multiple rooms of gambling minor govin's homes.""

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to translate the source text. However, it uses the phrase ""multiple rooms of gambling minor govin's homes"" which is not an accurate translation of the source text. The phrase ""multiple rooms of gambling minor govin'"" is not only grammatically incorrect but also culturally inappropriate.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and accurately translates the source text. It uses the phrase ""multi-purpose rooms in rural peasant houses"" which is a more appropriate translation of the source text.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has several grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the phrase ""multiple rooms of gambling minor govin'"" and the incorrect use of the verb ""were.""
* **Cultural inappropriateness:** The machine translation is culturally inappropriate as it uses the phrase ""gambling minor govin'"" which is not appropriate for a translation of a text about rural peasant houses.
* **Lack of accuracy:** The machine translation is not accurate as it does not translate the source text exactly. It uses a different phrase to describe the rooms and does not include the phrase ""specifically designed"" which is in the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not of good quality and is not an accurate translation of the source text. The reference translation is of much better quality and is more accurate.

**Machine translation:**
Over the centuries many prominent officials from that forefront and Confucian theologians were raised.

**Reference translation:**
Over the centuries the same lineage produced many high officials and Confucian scholars .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Use of the phrase ""prominent officials"" instead of ""high officials"":** The phrase ""prominent officials"" is not equivalent to ""high officials"" in this context. Prominent officials are not necessarily high officials.
* **Lack of the phrase ""same lineage"":** The phrase ""same lineage"" is important in the reference translation as it emphasizes the continuity of the lineage.
* **Use of the phrase ""forefront"" instead of ""foremost"":** The phrase ""forefront"" is not equivalent to ""foremost"" in this context. Forefront is a more specific term than foremost.
* **Lack of the phrase ""Confucian theologians"":** The phrase ""Confucian theologians"" is not included in the source text, so it has been omitted in the machine translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text as well as the reference translation. The use of different phrases and the omission of important information have resulted in a translation that is not as faithful to the original text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point, but it could be improved. The use of different phrases and the omission of important information have resulted in a translation that is not as accurate or faithful to the original text as the reference translation.

**Reference Translation:** At that time , the Venerable Monk understood the Buddha 's idea and said , "" Lord , accept this robe of mine . ""

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""lady"" repeatedly, while the reference translation uses more specific words like ""Venerable Monk"" and ""robe.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a more concise structure, while the reference translation is more verbose.
* **Context:** The machine translation does not provide enough context for the Buddha's idea, while the reference translation provides more context.
* **Style:** The machine translation is more formal, while the reference translation is more conversational.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation:**

The machine translation is well-translated, but it lacks some of the nuance and precision of the reference translation. The use of the word ""lady"" is a bit distracting, and the sentence structure is too concise. The lack of context and the formal style make the translation difficult to read and understand.

**Step 4: Recommendations:**

To improve the quality of the machine translation, the following changes could be made:

* Use more specific words than ""lady.""
* Use a more verbose sentence structure to provide more context.
* Include more context about the Buddha's idea.
* Use a more conversational style to make the translation easier to read and understand.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Sinhala-English translation

**1. Read the source:**

The source text is in Sinhala and describes the difficulty of translating the Holy Qur'an. It uses the phrase ""ශුද්ධ වු අල් කුර් ආන් පරිවර්තනය කිරීම"" which translates to ""Translating the Holy Qur 'an has always been a problematic and difficult task.""

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is in English and accurately translates the source text, but it uses the phrase ""Performing Holy Al Khur Aan"" instead of ""Translating the Holy Qur 'an."" This is a minor difference, but it does not affect the overall meaning of the text.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is in English and is a more formal and precise translation of the source text. It uses the same phrase as the source text, ""Translating the Holy Qur 'an has always been a problematic and difficult task.""

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""Performing Holy Al Khur Aan"" instead of ""Translating the Holy Qur 'an."" This is a difference in word choice that does not affect the overall meaning of the text.

## Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is in Sinhala and describes a problem as being so bad that it is a big problem for the King of Kandy.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and accurately translates the source text, but it does not capture the same sense of severity as the reference translation. The phrase ""fatal problem"" is a strong phrase that is not equivalent to ""big problem.""

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and accurately translates the source text while also capturing the same sense of severity as the original text. The phrase ""big problem"" is a more precise and nuanced translation of the Sinhala phrase ""මහත් ගැටලුවක්"" than the phrase ""fatal problem.""

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Use of stronger language:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""fatal problem"" which is a stronger phrase than the phrase ""big problem"" used in the reference translation.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not capture the same sense of precision as the reference translation. The phrase ""fatal problem"" is a very general phrase that does not specify the nature of the problem, while the phrase ""big problem"" is more specific and describes the problem in more detail.
* **Lack of cultural understanding:** The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of the Sinhala language. The phrase ""මහත් ගැටලුවක්"" is a phrase that is commonly used in Sinhala to describe a problem that is very serious.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not capture the same sense of severity as the reference translation. The machine translation uses stronger language and lacks precision and cultural understanding.

**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is in Sinhala and describes a situation where the Israelites are walking through a burning desert and Allah has provided shade from the thick clouds.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to translate the Sinhala text into English. However, it does not capture the nuances of the original text and makes several inaccuracies.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and provides a more accurate translation of the Sinhala text. It captures the meaning of the original text more closely and uses more precise language.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not use precise language and makes many generalizations. For example, it says ""thick clouds"" instead of specifying the thickness of the clouds.
* **Misinterpretation:** The machine translation misinterprets the original text in some places. For example, it says ""give shade of Allah"" instead of ""provide shade from Allah.""
* **Use of colloquial language:** The machine translation uses some colloquial language that is not appropriate for formal writing. For example, it uses the phrase ""wide daylight"" instead of ""bright day.""
* **Lack of cultural understanding:** The machine translation does not have a good understanding of Sri Lankan culture and customs. For example, it does not mention the significance of the desert in Sri Lankan mythology.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a very accurate translation of the Sinhala text.

**Source:** භගමණිය ඉවත් කිරීම සහ labia minora සම්පූර්ණයෙන්ම හෝ කොටසක් ඉවත් කිරීම සඳහා භාවිතා කරන නමකි.

**Machine translation:** The removal of bhagavati and labia minora is a name used for removal entirely or partly.

**Reference translation:** A name used to remove the aorta and remove the labia minora completely or partially .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **The machine translation does not mention the aorta.** The reference translation mentions the aorta in addition to the labia minora.
* **The machine translation uses the phrase ""removal of bhagavati and labia minora.""** The reference translation does not use this phrase. Instead, it uses the phrase ""a name used to remove the aorta and remove the labia minora.""
* **The machine translation does not specify whether the removal is entire or partial.** The reference translation specifies that the removal can be either entire or partial.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is different from the reference translation in several ways. The most significant difference is that the machine translation does not mention the aorta. This is a major error, as the aorta is an important part of the sentence. The machine translation also uses a different phrase than the reference translation. This makes the sentence sound awkward and unnatural. The machine translation does not specify whether the removal is entire or partial. This is also a major error, as it can be confusing for the reader.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is different from the reference translation in several ways. The most significant difference is that the machine translation does not mention the aorta. The machine translation also uses a different phrase than the reference translation and does not specify whether the removal is entire or partial.

**Source:**

ඉන්පසු උපාසකතුමා බුදුරජාණන් වහන්සේ සමීපයට ගොස් සිදුවූ සියල්ල පවසා, ""ස්වාමිනී, කිමෙක්ද, ඒ තෙරුන් වහන්සේට නුඹවහන්සේටද වඩා වැඩි වූ ගුණ ඇත්තෝදැයි"" විමසීය.

**Machine Translation:**

Then the degree is even closer to the Buddha, even if all that has happened, ""Master, kimi"", is that thus you are more virtuous than you are.

**Reference Translation:**

Then the devotee approached the Lord Buddha and told him everything that had happened and asked , "" Lord , what , does that monk have more in qualities than you ? ""

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It condenses the source text into fewer words.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the word ""degree"" instead of ""merit"" and ""Master"" instead of ""Lord.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more direct sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of some words in the source text. For example, the machine translation moves the phrase ""even if all that has happened"" to the beginning of the sentence.
* **Interpretation:** The machine translation interprets the source text differently than the reference translation. The machine translation focuses on the fact that the devotee is more virtuous than the Buddha, while the reference translation focuses on the fact that the devotee is approaching the Buddha.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation is more concise and uses different words and sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation also interprets the source text differently than the reference translation.

**Key differences:**

* **Conciseness:** The reference translation is more concise than the machine translation. The reference translation uses fewer words to convey the same meaning as the source text.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses more precise and specific words than the machine translation. For example, the reference translation uses the word ""meat"" instead of ""flesh"" to be more precise.
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation. The reference translation uses a compound sentence to combine the two sentences in the source text into one sentence.
* **Word order:** The reference translation follows a more logical order of words than the machine translation. The reference translation places the object (skins) first, followed by the verb (get) and then the subject (those).
* **Tense:** The reference translation uses the future tense to talk about the construction of the railway, while the machine translation uses the present tense.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is concise and easy to read, but it lacks precision and accuracy. The word choice is not always appropriate, and the sentence structure is simple. The word order is also not logical in some places. Overall, the machine translation is a good starting point, but it would need to be revised to be of higher quality.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Sinhala-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

"" විවිධ උප විශේෂයන් ඒවායේ ඵල වල හැඩයේ, කටු වල හැඩයේ වෙනස්කම් අනුව තරමක් දුරට වෙනස් වේ.""

**2. Read the machine translation:**

""Various subspecies in the shape of their tablets, rather than by the differences in the shape of the bones.""

**3. Read the reference translation:**

""Different subspecies vary slightly in the shape of their fruits and thorns.""

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Focus:** The machine translation focuses primarily on the shape of the tablets, while the reference translation focuses on the shape of the fruits and thorns.
* **Subject:** The machine translation uses the word ""subspecies"" to describe the different groups of animals, while the reference translation uses the word ""different subspecies.""
* **Verb:** The machine translation uses the verb ""vary"" in the sense of being different, while the reference translation uses the verb ""vary"" in the sense of being slightly different.
* **Preposition:** The machine translation uses the preposition ""of"" to connect the tablets to the shape, while the reference translation uses the preposition ""of"" to connect the fruits and thorns to the subspecies.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""tablets"" to describe the shape of the animals, while the reference translation uses the word ""fruits"" and ""thorns.""

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a perfect translation of the source text. While it captures the main ideas of the source text, it does not capture the nuances and precision of the reference translation. The machine translation is more focused on the shape of the tablets, while the reference translation is more focused on the shape of the fruits and thorns.

**Key differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""crew"" instead of ""different categories.""
    * The word ""evolution"" is used instead of ""evolutionary"" or ""amazing stories.""
    * The word ""stories"" is used instead of ""how they acquired""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure to fit an English sentence structure.
    * The phrase ""of how they acquired"" is moved to the end of the sentence.
    * The phrase ""during their evolution"" is omitted.
* **Meaning:**
    * The machine translation changes the meaning of the original text slightly.
    * The original text emphasizes the amazing stories of evolution, while the machine translation emphasizes the acquisition of flying categories.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text into English. It preserves the original sentence structure and word choice, while also conveying the same meaning.

**Key similarities:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The reference translation uses the same words as the source text.
    * The phrase ""different categories"" is used instead of ""various crew flights.""
    * The phrase ""how they acquired"" is used instead of ""of how they acquired.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The reference translation preserves the original sentence structure.
    * The phrase ""of how they acquired"" is in the same position as in the source text.
    * The phrase ""during their evolution"" is included.

**Step 4: Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It deviates from the original text in several ways, including word choice, sentence structure, and meaning. The reference translation is a more faithful translation of the source text, preserving the original sentence structure and word choice while conveying the same meaning.

**Machine translation:** A snow bear can hunt a sea bear twice as much as their volume.

**Reference translation:** A polar bear can hunt a sea elephant that weighs twice as much as its body mass.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Subject:** The source text refers to a polar bear hunting a sea elephant, while the machine translation refers to a snow bear hunting a sea bear.
* **Object:** The source text specifies the object as a sea elephant, while the machine translation uses the term ""sea bear.""
* **Weight vs. volume:** The reference translation emphasizes the weight of the sea elephant, while the machine translation focuses on its volume.
* **Verb ""hunt"":** The source text uses the verb ""කලහැක"" (hunt), while the machine translation uses the verb ""can hunt.""
* **Conjunction ""that"":** The reference translation uses the conjunction ""that"" to connect the clause ""that weighs twice as much as its body mass."" The machine translation does not use any conjunction.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to understand, but it lacks accuracy and precision in terms of subject, object, and verb usage. The translation also fails to capture the nuances of the source text, such as the use of the word ""ස්කන්ධය"" (mass) and the specific reference to a polar bear hunting a sea elephant.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is in Sinhala and describes a forest that is illuminated by the holy rays of the Buddha.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to translate the Sinhala text into English. However, it does not capture the nuances of the original text and instead uses a literal translation that is not idiomatic or natural in English.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate translation of the Sinhala text. It captures the meaning of the original text more closely and uses more vivid and descriptive language.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of idiomatic language:** The machine translation does not use idiomatic language that is common in English. For example, the phrase ""a hundred thousand suns"" is not idiomatic in English, and it would be more natural to say ""a hundred thousand suns were shining.""
* **Literal translation:** The machine translation simply translates the Sinhala text word-for-word into English, without considering the context or meaning of the original text. This results in a translation that is not natural or idiomatic.
* **Lack of descriptive language:** The machine translation does not use descriptive language to create a vivid and immersive experience for the reader. For example, the phrase ""the forest was illuminated like a thousand suns"" is not very descriptive, and it would be more natural to say ""the forest was illuminated with the radiance of a thousand suns.""
* **Inaccurate translation:** The machine translation does not accurately translate the meaning of the original text. For example, the phrase ""the six colors emitting from the holy rays"" is not accurate, and it would be more accurate to say ""the forest was illuminated with the radiant colors of the holy rays.""

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a very accurate or well-written translation of the Sinhala text. It lacks idiomatic language, uses a literal translation, lacks descriptive language, and is inaccurate. The reference translation is a more accurate and well-written translation of the Sinhala text. It captures the meaning of the original text more closely and uses more vivid and descriptive language.

* The sentence structure is simplified and the language is more concise.
* The phrase ""යුත් අයට දූරියන් පරිභෝජනය නොකිරීමට"" is not included.
* The phrase ""ගැබිණි කාන්තාවන්ට"" is not included.
* The word ""do not consume"" is used instead of ""are advised not to consume.""

**Reference translation:**
* The sentence structure is more complex and the language is more verbose.
* The phrase ""යුත් අයට දූරියන් පරිභෝජනය නොකිරීමට"" is included.
* The phrase ""ගැබිණි කාන්තාවන්ට"" is included.
* The phrase ""are advised not to consume"" is used instead of ""do not consume.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks the nuance and precision of the reference translation. The simplified sentence structure and the use of more concise language may make the translation easier to read, but it may also make it less clear. The omission of the phrases ""ගැබිණි කාන්තාවන්ට"" and ""යුත් අයට දූරියන් පරිභෝජනය නොකිරීමට"" may also be seen as a deficiency. Overall, the machine translation is a good approximation of the reference translation, but it could be improved.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** නමුත් ඔහුගේ දෙවන පුත් යි මියොංබොක් ඒ සඳහා සුදුස්සකු විය.

**Machine translation:** But his second son and dyingbock were eligible for it.

**Reference translation:** But his second son , Myonbok was accepted for it .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""dyingbock"" instead of ""Myonbok.""
- Does not include the phrase ""accepted"" after ""second son.""
- Does not specify the relationship between the second son and the deceased person.

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""Myonbok"" instead of ""dyingbock.""
- Includes the phrase ""accepted"" after ""second son.""
- Specifies the relationship between the second son and the deceased person (Myonbok).

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is different from the reference translation in several ways. The use of the phrase ""dyingbock"" is not appropriate, as it is not a synonym for ""Myonbok."" The omission of the phrase ""accepted"" is also a problem, as it is essential to the meaning of the sentence. The lack of specificity in the machine translation is also a problem, as it does not make it clear who the second son is or what relationship he has to the deceased person.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is different from the reference translation in several ways, including the use of inappropriate phrases, the omission of essential phrases, and the lack of specificity.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is in Sinhala and describes the purpose of a glass cover used in tombs.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to translate the source text. However, it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text and uses different phrasing.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate translation of the source text. It uses similar phrasing to the source text and clearly states the purpose of the glass cover.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Phrasing:** The machine translation uses different phrasing than the source text and the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""යෙදූයේ සොහොන්ගැබට ඇතුළුවන සංචාරකයන්"" is translated as ""tourists entering the tomb"" in the machine translation, but as ""tourists entering the tomb"" in the reference translation.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the source text and the reference translation. For example, the word ""වීදුරු"" is translated as ""glass cover"" in the machine translation, but as ""glass cover"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the source text and the reference translation. For example, the sentence ""මමිය වියෝජනය වන වේගය අවම කරලීමටයි"" is translated as ""to minimize the moisture and temperature of the mummy voyage"" in the machine translation, but as ""to reduce the rate at which the mummy decomposes"" in the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It uses different phrasing, word choice, and sentence structure than the source text. The machine translation also does not capture the exact meaning of the source text.

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It uses the phrase ""much information"" to condense the source text.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""goguryeo"" instead of ""Goguryeo."" This is because the machine translation does not have access to the same domain-specific vocabulary as the human translator.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. It uses a simple sentence structure to make the translation more concise.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of some words in the source text. This is because the machine translation is trying to find the best way to translate the source text into English.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written, but it does have some errors. The conciseness and the use of domain-specific vocabulary are the main strengths of the machine translation. However, the use of different sentence structure and the change of word order are the main weaknesses of the machine translation.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation of the source text. However, it does have some errors that could be improved.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** 12 වැනි සහ වැනි සිය වස්වල සෙන් කෘතීන් බිහි වී තිබුණි.

**Machine translation:** Zen articles in the 12th and hundredth volumes were created.

**Reference translation:** Zen works were produced in the 12th century .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Lack of specificity:** The machine translation does not specify the number of the hundredth volume, while the reference translation specifies ""the 12th century.""
* **Inaccurate verb translation:** The machine translation uses the verb ""were created"" in the past tense, while the reference translation uses the verb ""were produced"" in the past tense.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not mention the specific content or nature of the Zen articles, while the reference translation mentions ""Zen works.""
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the word ""hundredth.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the quality of the machine translation is poor. It lacks specificity, accuracy, precision, and grammatical correctness. The translation is also not very clear or concise.

**Step 4: Conclusion**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It is not able to capture the nuances and precision of the original text. The reference translation is a much better translation, as it is more specific, accurate, precise, and grammatically correct.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not use the same precise language as the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the phrase ""comes there"" instead of ""arrives"" in the second sentence.
* **Lack of nuance:** The machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original text. For example, the machine translation does not mention Vishnu's disguise as Mohini, while the reference translation does.
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation does not include some of the details and descriptions that are found in the original text.
* **Structure:** The machine translation does not follow the same structure as the original text. For example, the machine translation uses a more linear structure, while the original text uses a more complex structure.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good summary of the source text, but it lacks the precision, nuance, and elegance of the reference translation. The reference translation is a more accurate and faithful translation of the source text, and it also preserves the original meaning and structure of the text more closely.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation**

**Source:** Allium cepa වගා කිරීම මගින්ම දැනගත්තාවූ සුවිශේෂී වර්ගයකි.

**Machine translation:** Allium cepa is a peculiar species known by the genus Allium.

**Reference translation:** Allium cepa is a unique variety known for its cultivation .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the term ""species"" instead of ""variety"" to describe Allium cepa.
- Does not mention the cultivation of Allium cepa.
- Does not provide any details about the uniqueness of Allium cepa.

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the term ""variety"" to describe Allium cepa.
- Mentions the cultivation of Allium cepa.
- Provides details about the uniqueness of Allium cepa.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation**

The machine translation is grammatically correct, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation. The use of the term ""species"" instead of ""variety"" is misleading, as Allium cepa is a variety of the Allium genus, not a species. The lack of details about the cultivation of Allium cepa and the uniqueness of the variety is also a major issue.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation**

The reference translation is well-written and accurate. It uses the correct terminology and provides sufficient details about the cultivation of Allium cepa and the uniqueness of the variety.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is lower than the quality of the reference translation. The machine translation lacks precision, accuracy, and details. The reference translation is more accurate, precise, and provides more information about the topic.

## Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is a short sentence in Sinhala that mentions the name ""Dataquet"" and the phrase ""square knife.""

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation accurately translates the source text, but it does not include the phrase ""Dataquet names."" Instead, it uses the phrase ""Dataquet names are not mentioned.""

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is identical to the source text, except for the use of the phrase ""Dataquet names"" instead of ""Dataquet names are not mentioned.""

**Analysis of differences between machine and reference translations:**

* **Omission of phrase ""Dataquet names"":** The machine translation omits the phrase ""Dataquet names"" from the source text. This is a common error in machine translation, where the translator may not be able to identify all of the necessary phrases in the source text.
* **Different phrasing:** The machine translation uses different phrasing than the source text and reference translation. For example, the phrase ""although the present eight are added to the square knife"" is not present in the source text. This is because the machine translator may be trying to improve the flow of the sentence or make it more concise.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some differences from the reference translation. These differences are primarily due to the omission of the phrase ""Dataquet names"" and the use of different phrasing.

**Reference translation:**

But by 1877 , compared to the westernized cities of Tokyo and Osaka , Seoul and Busan looked like remnants of ancient history .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""balance"" instead of ""remained"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""cities"" instead of ""cities and compared"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to a more concise form.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""like remnants of ancient history"" from the reference translation.
* **Conciseness:**
    * The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style than the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation**

**Source:**
මෙය වර්තමානය වන විට නොවිසිදුනු දික් ගැස්සුණු සමාජ ගැටුමක් දක්වා වර්ධනය වි ඇත.

**Machine translation:**
This is presently growing up to an uneventful pointed social impact.

**Reference translation:**
This has now developed into an unresolved protracted social conflict .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

* **Lack of specificity:** The machine translation does not specify the nature of the social conflict, while the reference translation states it as ""protracted"" and ""unsolved.""
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation uses the term ""uneventful"" to describe the social impact, which is not precise enough. The reference translation uses more precise terms such as ""protracted"" and ""unsolved.""
* **Different word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""pointed"" instead of ""protracted"" and ""impact"" instead of ""conflict.""
* **Lack of cultural understanding:** The machine translation does not capture the cultural context of the source text, such as the use of the word ""දික්"" (conflict) and the phrase ""වර්ධනය වි ඇත"" (growing up).
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the incorrect verb form ""growing up"" and the lack of punctuation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including its lack of specificity, precision, different word choice, lack of cultural understanding, and grammatical errors. These differences are due to the limitations of machine translation technology and its inability to fully capture the nuances of the source text.

## Evaluation of Sinhala-English Translation

**Source:**

තවද, කාර්යය මණ්ඩල සාමාජිකයකු, ලියුම් මලු තුළ සැඟවී හොර රහසේම නැවෙන් පැනයාමක්ද මෙම වරායේදී වාර්තා වී තිබුණි.

**Machine Translation:**

And, a crew member, hiding in the bags of letters, secretly an escape from the ship that had been reported in this port.

**Reference Translation:**

A crew member was also reported to have sneaked out of the ship , hiding in envelopes bages at the port .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""escape"" instead of ""sneak out."" This is a more direct translation of the Sinhala word ""නැවෙන් පැනයාම"" which also means ""escape."" However, the word ""escape"" is not as precise as ""sneak out"" which implies a more secretive and hidden action.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""bags of letters"" instead of ""envelopes bages."" This is a closer translation of the Sinhala word ""ලියුම් මලු"" which also means ""envelopes."" However, the phrase ""bags of letters"" is not as idiomatic as ""envelopes bages"" which is a more common phrase in English.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a compound sentence, while the reference translation uses a simple sentence. This is due to the different sentence structure in Sinhala, which often uses compound sentences.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation. The machine translation puts the phrase ""secretly an escape"" at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation puts it in the middle of the sentence. This is also due to the different sentence structure in Sinhala.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the original text. The machine translation is more direct and concise, while the reference translation is more precise and idiomatic.

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the term ""Cypriot badge"" instead of ""sacred foot logo.""
* Does not mention the purpose of the logo (worship).
* Uses the phrase ""placed hindsight"" instead of ""erected.""
* Does not use the phrase ""has also been"" to indicate the additional logo.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the term ""sacred foot logo"" accurately.
* Explains the purpose of the logo (worship).
* Uses the phrase ""erected"" to accurately describe the action of setting up the logo.
* Uses the phrase ""has also been"" to indicate the additional logo.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the analysis above, the machine translation is not of high quality. It lacks accuracy, fluency, and understanding of the source text. The use of incorrect terminology, inappropriate phrasing, and the omission of important information all contribute to the low quality of the translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** නමුත් ඒ වෙනුවට බොහෝ චීනුන් සහ විදේශ තානාපති නිවාස වටලන ලදී.

**Machine translation:** But instead, many Chinese and foreign ambassador houses were raided.

**Reference translation:** But instead many Chinese and foreign embassies were besieged.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Use of the word ""houses"" instead of ""embassies"":** The machine translation uses the word ""houses"" instead of ""embassies."" This is a common error made by machine translation systems, as the word ""embassy"" is not always recognized.
* **Lack of the word ""many"":** The machine translation does not include the word ""many."" This is because the machine translation system is not able to determine the exact number of Chinese and foreign ambassador houses.
* **Use of the verb ""raided"" instead of ""besieged"":** The machine translation uses the verb ""raided"" instead of ""besieged."" This is a more colloquial verb that is not as formal as the verb ""besieged.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is of poor quality. It is not able to accurately capture the meaning of the source text, and it also makes a number of grammatical errors.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It is different from the reference translation in a number of ways, including the use of different words and phrases, the lack of precision, and the presence of grammatical errors.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source text:**
1627දී, 30,000ක සෙබලුන්ගෙන් සමන්විත ජුර්චෙන් හමුදාවක්, නුර්හාකිගේ බෑනා වූ අමින්ගේ නායකත්වය යටතේ ජොසොන් හමුදා පැරද වී ය.

**Machine translation:**
In 1627, an army of 30,000 troops from jürchen, nürki's nephew amin's leader, defeated the joseon army.

**Reference translation:**
In 1627 , a Jurchen army of 30,000 troops , led by Nurhaki 's son - in - law , defeated Joseon 's army .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""jürchen"" instead of ""Jurchen.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""troops"" instead of ""army.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""leader"" instead of ""son - in - law.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text.
    * The machine translation uses a more concise sentence structure.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of words in the sentence.
    * The machine translation moves the modifier ""of 30,000 troops"" to the end of the sentence.
* **Syntax:**
    * The machine translation does not use the same syntax as the source text.
    * The machine translation does not use the same verb tense as the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some differences from the reference translation. These differences are due to the fact that the machine translation is not able to fully capture the nuances of the source text. However, the machine translation is still a useful tool for translating Sinhala-English text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** •\tආණ්ඩුකාරවරයා සතු අවධාරිත හා නිෂේධ බලය නිසා ඔහුගේ බලය වර්ධනය වීම.

**Machine translation:** • The Governor has the ability to develop his powers due to concentration and inhibition.

**Reference translation:** Growing power of the Governor due to his emphasized and veto power .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""powers"" instead of ""ability"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""concentration"" instead of ""emphasis"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""inhibition"" instead of ""veto power"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to a more concise and direct structure.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the source text.
* **Meaning:**
    * The machine translation does not capture the same meaning as the source text.
    * The machine translation does not explain the reason for the Governor's increased power.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is different from the reference translation in many ways, including word choice, sentence structure, and meaning. The machine translation is also not very clear or concise.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a good translation of the source text. It is different from the reference translation in many ways and does not capture the same meaning. The machine translation is also not very clear or concise.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** එමෙන්ම වාෂ්ප නැව් නිපදවීමත් සමග තෙල් කර්මාන්තය පවත්වාගෙන යාම සඳහා වාෂ්ප බලය නැතුවම බැරි බලශක්තියක් වී තිබුණි.

**Machine translation:** Also with the construction of steamships, the oil industry was an impossible energy without steam power.

**Reference translation:** Also , with the construction of steam ships , steam power became an indispensable force for sustaining the oil industry .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Omit the phrase ""with the construction of steamships.""
* Use the phrase ""impossible energy"" instead of ""indispensable force.""
* Change ""power became"" to ""was an impossible energy.""

**Reference translation:**
* Use the phrase ""with the construction of steam ships"" to provide context.
* Use the phrase ""indispensable force"" to emphasize the importance of steam power.
* Change ""power became"" to ""became an indispensable force.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""impossible energy"" is not appropriate in this context, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The omission of the phrase ""with the construction of steamships"" also makes the translation less clear.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more accurate and nuanced than the machine translation. The use of the phrase ""indispensable force"" is a good way to convey the importance of steam power in sustaining the oil industry. The inclusion of the phrase ""with the construction of steam ships"" also provides more context for the reader.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, nuanced, and provides more context than the machine translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is in Sinhala and describes a Buddhist monk being imprisoned on suspicion of being in the enemy army.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to translate the source text. However, it is not a very accurate translation and has several errors.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate translation of the source text. It correctly identifies the monk's descent and the suspicion of being in the enemy army.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the monk's descent, whereas the reference translation states that he is of German descent.
* **Misinterpretation:** The machine translation incorrectly states that the monk is suspected of being imprisoned in the ""hostile army,"" when the source text states that he is suspected of being in the ""enemy army.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""hostile"" to describe the army, whereas the reference translation uses the word ""enemy.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a different sentence structure than the source text and the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a very accurate translation of the source text and has several errors. The reference translation is a more accurate translation that correctly identifies the monk's descent and the suspicion of being in the enemy army.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model
