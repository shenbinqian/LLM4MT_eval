A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:**
26 र 27 गते दुर्इदिनसम्म सत्याग्रह चलेपछि राजकीय परिषदबाट मागहरू पूरा गरिदिने स्वीकृति प्राप्त भएकाले नेपाली कांग्रेसका अध्यक्ष वी.पी.

**Machine translation:**
W. P., chairman of the Nepali Congress, who obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council after a satellite run of 26 and 27.

**Reference translation:**
B. P. , the chairman of the Nepali Congress , who obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council after a Satyagrah run of 26 and 27 .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Use of formal language:** The reference translation uses more formal language than the machine translation, such as the use of the term ""Satyagrah"" instead of ""satellite run.""
* **Use of synonyms:** The reference translation uses synonyms for some words in the source text, such as ""demands"" and ""permit.""
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation has a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation.
* **Use of passive voice:** The reference translation uses more passive voice than the machine translation.
* **Use of conjunctions:** The reference translation uses more conjunctions to connect sentences and clauses.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some areas where it could be improved. The use of formal language and synonyms is appropriate, but the sentence structure and use of passive voice are not. The machine translation also lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved. The main areas where the machine translation could be improved are its sentence structure, use of conjunctions, and precision.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source text:** पछि गरिएका अनुसन्धानहरुबाट उनको जन्म दक्षिण भारतमा भएको जानकारी प्राप्त हुन्छ ।

**Machine translation:** His birthday from later investigations is obtained in South India.

**Reference translation:** From later investigations , this information is obtained that he was born in South India .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* The phrase ""पछि गरिएका अनुसन्धानहरुबाट"" is not translated.
* The phrase ""जन्म दक्षिण भारतमा"" is translated as ""in South India.""
* The phrase ""प्राप्त हुन्छ"" is translated as ""is obtained.""

**Reference translation:**
* The phrase ""पछि गरिएका अनुसन्धानहरुबाट"" is translated as ""from later investigations.""
* The phrase ""जन्म दक्षिण भारतमा"" is translated as ""in South India.""
* The phrase ""प्राप्त हुन्छ"" is translated as ""is obtained.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text. The phrase ""पछि गरिएका अनुसन्धानहरुबाट"" is not translated, which is important because it provides context for the sentence. The phrase ""जन्म दक्षिण भारतमा"" is translated correctly, but the phrase ""प्राप्त हुन्छ"" is not translated correctly. The phrase ""प्राप्त हुन्छ"" is a formal verb that is not commonly used in English. A more natural translation would be:

**Machine translation:** His birthday is obtained from later investigations in South India.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source text:** त्यस बराबरी खेलको दुई हप्तापछि उनीहरू बीच पुन खेल भयो तर खेल पहिलाको जस्तै बराबरीमा समाप्त भएको थियो।

**Machine translation:** After two weeks of that equal game, they were rebounded between them, but the game ended as before.

**Reference translation:** Two weeks after that draw , they played again , but the game ended in a draw like the previous game .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""rebounded"" instead of ""played again""
* Omits the phrase ""like the previous game""
* Does not use the same word order as the reference translation

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""played again""
* Includes the phrase ""like the previous game""
* Uses a different word order than the machine translation

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""rebounded"" instead of ""played again"" is a good example of this. The omission of the phrase ""like the previous game"" also detracts from the quality of the translation.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. It is more faithful to the original text and it also captures the nuances of the original text more accurately.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is the better translation of the source text. It is more accurate, more faithful to the original text, and it also captures the nuances of the original text more accurately.

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is in Nepali and describes the spread of the descendants of Maharshi Gautam from Mithila. It uses the word ""Gautam gotris"" to refer to the early Gautama clan and ""Mithila"" to refer to a region in Nepal.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation attempts to capture the meaning of the source text but does not preserve the original structure and style. It uses the word ""honeymoon"" instead of ""Gautam gotris"" and ""Mitchell"" instead of ""Mithila.""

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

    * The machine translation uses the word ""honeymoon"" instead of ""Gautam gotris."" This is a poor choice of words as ""honeymoon"" does not have the same meaning as ""Gautam gotris.""
    * The reference translation uses the word ""Maharshi Gautam"" instead of ""Gautam gotris."" This is a more accurate translation as ""Maharshi Gautam"" is a more precise term than ""Gautam gotris.""
* **Structure:**
    * The machine translation does not preserve the original structure of the source text. It uses a more complex sentence structure than the source text.
    * The reference translation preserves the original structure of the source text. It uses a similar sentence structure to the source text.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation does not preserve the original style of the source text. It uses a more formal style than the source text.
    * The reference translation preserves the original style of the source text. It uses a similar style to the source text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not of good quality and does not accurately capture the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is of much better quality and is more accurate to the source text.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Nepali-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

**Source:** कर्मचारी भएमा कार्यालयबाट नै र रा.प.अनंर्.कर्मचारी भएमा विभागबाट निर्दिष्ट

**2. Read the machine translation:**

**Machine translation:** Specifically from the department if employed, and from the office if employed.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

**Reference translation:** From office if employee and from department if non-gazetted employee

**4. Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""department"" instead of ""division"" in the second sentence. This is a semantic error, as the word ""department"" is not synonymous with ""division"" in this context.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""specifically"" in the first sentence. This is unnecessary, as the phrase ""if employed"" already specifies the scope of the sentence.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the original text. The original text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses two sentences. This changes the flow of the sentence and makes it less clear.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""if non-gazetted employee"" to the end of the second sentence. This is not a logical placement, as it is not clear who the non-gazetted employee is.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the second sentence. The original text has the order ""from office if employee"" while the machine translation has the order ""from the office if employee."" This changes the flow of the sentence and makes it less clear.

**5. Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It has made several errors in word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The reference translation is much closer to the original text in terms of accuracy and clarity.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

यसमा सङ्घीय संरचना हुन्छ तर केन्द्रले इकाइहरूलाई केही अधिकार दिएको हुन्छ र केन्द्रको आदेशमा इकाइहरू चल्छन्।

**Machine translation:**
It has a federal structure but the center has some authority to the units and the units run on the command of the center.

**Reference translation:**
It has a federal structure but the center has given some authority to the units and the units run under the command of the center .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""authority to the units"" instead of ""given some authority to the units.""
* Does not use the phrase ""under the command of the center"" but uses ""on the command of the center.""
* Does not specify the units' running under the center's command.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""given some authority to the units"" to be more precise.
* Uses the phrase ""under the command of the center"" to clarify the relationship between the units and the center.
* Specifies the units' running under the center's command as ""the units.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate but lacks precision and clarity. It correctly identifies the main points of the source text but does not capture the nuances and details as well as the reference translation. The use of incorrect phrasing and the omission of certain phrases contribute to the overall low quality of the translation.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is of high quality and accurately reflects the source text. It uses precise language and clear phrasing to convey the meaning of the source text. The use of appropriate terminology and the clear organization of the sentence structure enhance the readability and understanding of the translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:**
यो देखेर सोझा गोपहरूले देवता खुसी भएर हामीले चढाएको फल फूल, प्रसाद सबै देवताले खाए भन्ने ठाने।

**Machine translation:**
And when they saw that we had eaten the fruit of the gods, and the fruit of the gods, and the fruit of all the gods,

**Reference translation:**
And the naive Gops thought that god had eaten all the fruits which they had offered him by being happy with them .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""fruit of the gods"" repeatedly, which is not as precise as the reference translation's ""fruits which they had offered him.""
    * The machine translation does not use the word ""naive"" to describe the Gops, which is important for conveying their lack of understanding.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation.
    * The machine translation does not use the same verb ""had eaten"" as the reference translation.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence.
    * The machine translation does not follow the same word order as the reference translation.
* **Tone:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal tone than the reference translation.
    * The machine translation does not convey the same sense of joy and happiness as the reference translation.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including word choice, sentence structure, word order, and tone. These differences are due to the different ways in which the machine translation and the reference translation interpret the source text. The machine translation is more literal, while the reference translation is more idiomatic and conveys the meaning of the source text more effectively.

Often, sorcery is written after the sorcery order and after the sorcery completion.

**Reference Translation:**
Most of the researchers write during and after the research .

**Step 2: Identifying Differences between Machine Translation and Reference Translation**

**Machine Translation:**

* **Misinterpretation:** The machine translation incorrectly interprets the source text, mistaking ""शोधार्थी"" (researcher) for ""sorcerer.""
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has grammatical errors such as the use of ""sorcery"" instead of ""research"" and the incorrect verb tense.
* **Lack of clarity:** The machine translation lacks clarity and precision, as it does not specify the scope of researchers or the purpose of writing.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the source text, such as ""sorcery"" instead of ""research"" and ""order"" instead of ""process.""

**Reference Translation:**

* **Accuracy:** The reference translation is more accurate, as it correctly interprets the source text and uses similar wording.
* **Grammatical correctness:** The reference translation is grammatically correct and uses appropriate verb tenses.
* **Clarity and precision:** The reference translation is clear and precise, as it specifies the scope of researchers and the purpose of writing.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses similar words to the source text, such as ""researchers"" instead of ""sorcerers"" and ""during"" instead of ""after.""

**Step 3: Evaluation**

The machine translation is not of good quality due to its misinterpretation, grammatical errors, lack of clarity, and use of different words. The reference translation is of much better quality, as it is accurate, grammatically correct, clear, and precise.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is the more accurate, grammatically correct, and clear translation of the source text. It is also more faithful to the original text in terms of word choice and style.

**S सुरुमा वस्तु निर्देश, नमस्क्रिया वा आशीर्वाद रहनु पर्दछ।**

This text is in Nepali and it means ""In the beginning, there should be direction, greeting or blessing.""

**2. Read the machine translation:**

**Initially the object must be direction, salute or blessing.**

This is the translation produced by a machine translation system.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

**In the beginning , there should be direction , greeting or blessing .**

This is the translation produced by a human translator.

**4. Compare the machine translation with the reference translation:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""object"" instead of ""direction"" in the first sentence.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the second sentence.
* **Style:** The machine translation has a more formal style than the reference translation.

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Source:**

> उनको यस कदमबाट कत्युरमा गौतम गोत्री क्षेत्रिय, ब्राह्मण आदिलाई सामाजिक विकास गर्ने प्रसस्त मौका मिल्यो ।

**Machine Translation:**

> From his steps in Qatar, the latest gothic region, brahmins etc., was enough to develop socialism.

**Reference Translation:**

> This step of him provided ample opportunity for social development of Gautam Gotri Chhetriyas , Brahmins , etc. in Katyur .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways.

* **Thematic focus:** The source text focuses on the social development of the Gautama Gotri Chhetriyas and Brahmins in Katyur. The machine translation, however, focuses on the development of socialism.
* **Use of language:** The source text uses formal and concise language. The machine translation uses more colloquial and less formal language.
* **Sentence structure:** The source text uses a complex sentence structure. The machine translation uses simpler sentence structure.
* **Word choice:** The source text uses specific words that are not readily available in English, such as ""क्षेत्रिय"" and ""सामाजिक."" The machine translation uses synonyms for these words that are more common in English.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not a very accurate translation of the source text. It is more concerned with the development of socialism than the social development of the Gautama Gotri Chhetriyas and Brahmins in Katyur. The machine translation also uses less formal language and simpler sentence structure than the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** यी शोध कार्यलाई नै केन्द्रित भएर लेखिएका हुन्छन् ।

**Machine translation:** These surviving works are written with a focus.

**Reference translation:** These are written with research work in mind .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
- The translation is concise and to the point, but it lacks the nuance and precision of the reference translation.
- The translation does not capture the cultural context of the source text, such as the use of the word ""शोध कार्य"" (research work).
- The translation does not use the same vocabulary and phrasing as the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**
- The translation is more verbose and detailed than the machine translation, but it also more accurate and faithful to the original text.
- The translation captures the cultural context of the source text more effectively.
- The translation uses similar vocabulary and phrasing to the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the analysis above, the machine translation is not of high quality. It is accurate but lacks nuance and precision, and it does not capture the cultural context of the source text. The translation also uses different vocabulary and phrasing than the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for a translation, but it would need to be revised and edited to produce a more accurate and faithful translation of the source text.

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** कहिले राधादी गोपिनीसँग रासलिला गरेका थिए त कहिले माता यशोदालाई भए नभएका मागहरू राखेर दिक्क पारेका थिए।

**Machine translation:** Sometimes racialized with radical gopini, there was sometimes no demands for Mata Ishida.

**Reference translation:** Sometimes he had quarreled with Radha and Gopini , and sometimes , he annoyed his mother Yashoda by making unreasonable demands .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Conciseness:** The reference translation is more concise than the machine translation. The reference translation uses fewer words to convey the same meaning as the source text.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses more precise and formal language than the machine translation. For example, the reference translation uses the word ""unreasonable"" to describe the demands, while the machine translation uses the word ""radical.""
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation. The reference translation uses a compound sentence to describe the two actions of quarreling and annoying.
* **Tense:** The reference translation uses a more precise tense than the machine translation. The reference translation uses the past tense to describe the actions that occurred in the past, while the machine translation uses the present tense.
* **Cultural references:** The reference translation includes cultural references that are not present in the source text or the machine translation. For example, the reference translation mentions ""Radha"" and ""Gopini,"" which are characters in the Hindu epic Mahabharata.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways, including conciseness, word choice, sentence structure, tense, and cultural references. While the machine translation is able to capture the main meaning of the source text, it does not do so with the same precision and accuracy as the reference translation.

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is a Nepali sentence that uses figurative language and is relatively complex. It uses the phrase ""हजुरले कुनै यस्तो उपाय बताउनु हवस्"" which is a proverb that means ""there is no solution to every problem."" The sentence also uses the phrase ""यी सम्पूर्ण धनसम्पत्ति नाश हवोस्"" which means ""all this wealth will be destroyed.""

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation is a literal translation of the source text. It accurately translates the words and phrases of the source text, but it does not capture the meaning or intent of the original sentence. The translation is also very verbose and uses a lot of unnecessary words.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text. It captures the meaning and intent of the original sentence more closely than the machine translation. The translation is also more concise and uses less unnecessary words.

**Areas where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the word ""joy"" instead of ""peace"" and ""wealth"" instead of ""treasure.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more concise sentence structure.
* **Figurative language:** The machine translation does not capture the figurative language of the source text. The reference translation does a better job of capturing the figurative language of the source text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a literal translation of the source text, but it does not capture the meaning or intent of the original sentence. The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text that captures the meaning and intent of the original sentence more closely.

**Machine translation:** Because he wanted to know from a different perspective relating to living.

**Reference translation:** Because he wanted to know from a different point of view about the world life .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Relating to living:** The phrase ""relating to living"" is a more general phrase than ""about the world life."" It does not specify the topic of living as much as the reference translation does.
* **Different perspective:** The phrase ""different perspective"" is a good translation of the Nepali phrase ""फरक दृष्टिकोण."" However, it does not capture the nuance of the Nepali phrase ""सम्बन्धी"" which implies a connection to the subject of living.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the subject of ""living"" or the ""world life."" It is not clear what the author is talking about.

**Reference translation:**

* **Different point of view:** The phrase ""different point of view"" is a more precise translation of the Nepali phrase ""फरक दृष्टिकोण."" It captures the nuance of the Nepali phrase better than the machine translation.
* **About the world life:** The phrase ""about the world life"" is a more specific phrase than ""relating to living."" It clearly states the topic of the author's writing.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. It is more precise, captures the nuance of the Nepali phrase better, and is more clear in its meaning.

    * The source text uses the word ""कुलखान्दन"" which is a specific term in Nepali for ""tribunal"". The machine translation uses the word ""tribunal"" which is a general term.
    * The source text uses the word ""आवस्यक"" which is a word that means ""necessary"". The machine translation uses the word ""required"" which is a similar word but not exact.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The source text uses a complex sentence structure with a compound predicate. The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a single predicate.
    * The source text uses a passive voice. The machine translation uses an active voice.
* **Word order:**
    * The source text follows a different word order than the machine translation.
    * The source text uses a more formal tone than the machine translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text in some cases.

- Does not use the phrase ""because of which"" to introduce the cause.
- Does not use the phrase ""a lot of"" to quantify the number of tourists.
- Uses the phrase ""gatherings"" instead of ""gather"" to describe the action of tourists.

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""because of which"" to introduce the cause.
- Uses the phrase ""because of which"" to introduce the cause.
- Uses the phrase ""a lot of"" to quantify the number of tourists.
- Uses the phrase ""gather"" to describe the action of tourists.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text as well as the reference translation. The use of different phrases and word choices in the machine translation can lead to a different meaning or interpretation than the source text.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more faithful to the source text, but it is not as concise or clear as the machine translation. The use of the phrase ""because of which"" twice in the reference translation can be redundant.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the machine translation is more accurate in terms of grammar and word choice, but the reference translation is more faithful to the source text. The best translation would be a compromise between the two, incorporating the accuracy of the machine translation with the clarity of the reference translation.

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation:**

**Source:**

 मोतीरामपछि विभिन्न लेखकहरूले नेपाली भाषामा नाटकको अनुवाद गर्ने परम्परालाई अगाडि बढाएको देखिए पनि नाटकमा मौलिक लेखन भने आउन सकेको थिएन।

**Machine Translation:**

After Motiram, several writers seemed to have fronted the tradition of translating the dance into nepali, even if the original writer could not come to the dance.

**Reference Translation:**

After Moti Ram , though various writers seem to have carried forward the tradition of translating plays into Nepali , original writings could not come in plays .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**Machine Translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It uses fewer words to convey the same meaning.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, ""अगाडि बढाएको"" is translated as ""fronted"" in the machine translation, while it is translated as ""carried forward"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. For example, the sentence ""नाटकमा मौलिक लेखन भने आउन सकेको थिएन"" is translated as ""original writings could not come in plays"" in the machine translation, while it is translated as ""original writings could not come in plays"" in the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation:**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand. However, it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. For example, the machine translation does not mention the fact that the original writer could not come to the dance. This information is important because it helps to explain why the original writings could not come in plays.

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** 2011 मा संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिकाको अस्पतालमा COPD महँगो अवस्थाहरू मध्येमा पर्दथ्यो, जहाँ कूल $5.7 अरबको खर्च भएको थियो।

**Machine translation:** In 2011, COPD was among the highest constituencies in the United States voluntarily, where a total of $ 5.7 was spent on Arabia.

**Reference translation:** In 2011 , COPD was one of the most expensive cases in the United States that cost a total of $ 5.7 billion .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Inaccurate use of terminology:** The term ""constituency"" is not appropriate in this context. ""Constituency"" refers to a group of voters in a particular district, not a medical condition.
* **Misuse of verb ""voluntarily"":** The word ""voluntarily"" is not suitable in this sentence as it implies that COPD patients have a choice in the matter.
* **Inaccurate use of the word ""Arabia"":** Arabia is not mentioned in the source text. The correct word is ""United States.""
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the cost of COPD in the United States in 2011.

**Reference translation:**
* **Precise use of terminology:** The term ""cases"" is appropriate in this context to refer to medical conditions.
* **Accurate use of verb ""cost"":** The word ""cost"" is used correctly in the reference translation to indicate the financial burden of COPD.
* **Precision:** The reference translation specifies the cost of COPD in the United States in 2011 as $ 5.7 billion.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation due to inaccurate use of terminology, misuse of verbs, inaccurate use of words, and lack of precision. The reference translation is more accurate and precise in conveying the information from the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:**
एम्ब्रोजले एक हलिउड चलचित्र लbezpieczमा पनि जोन सको भूमिकामा चलचित्र खेलेका छन् ।

**Machine translation:**
Ambrose has also played a movie in the role of John s. Lockdown in a Hollywood movie.

**Reference translation:**
Ambrose has also played the role of John Shaw in a hollywood movie Lockdown .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Use of synonyms:** The machine translation uses the synonym ""movie"" for ""चलचित्र,"" while the reference translation uses the more specific term ""Lockdown.""
* **Order of words:** The machine translation changes the order of the words ""John s."" and ""Lockdown,"" while the reference translation keeps the order the same.
* **Use of articles:** The machine translation does not use the article ""the"" before ""Hollywood movie,"" while the reference translation does.

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** त्यसको राजनीतिक प्रणाली त्यसबेला संचालित कुनै पनि प्रणालीभन्दा फरक थियो ।

**Machine translation:** Its political system was different from any system automatically constituted at that time.

**Reference translation:** Its political system was different from any other system in operation at that time.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""automatically constituted"" to describe the system being different.

**Machine translation:**

* **Subjectivity:** The machine translation uses the word ""subjective"" to describe the answer, which is not present in the source text.
* **Neglecting the purpose:** The machine translation does not mention the purpose of the information being provided (to read the history of the Nepali communist armed struggle).
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""nepalese"" instead of ""Nepali"" in the second sentence.
* **Syntax:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the source text.

**Reference translation:**

* **Completeness:** The reference translation uses the word ""incomplete"" to describe the answer, which is more accurate than the machine translation.
* **Purpose:** The reference translation mentions the purpose of the information being provided in the second sentence.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses the word ""Nepali"" instead of ""nepalese"" in the second sentence.
* **Syntax:** The reference translation uses a similar sentence structure to the source text.

The support of the Mavals later proved to be as important for Shivaji Maharaj as the support of Afghans was for Sher Shah Suri .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Omission of the phrase ""जति शेरशाह सूरीका लागि अफगानोंको  साथ""**
* **Use of the phrase ""assistant of Mauls"" instead of ""support of the Mavals""**
* **Use of the phrase ""became important"" instead of ""proved to be as important""**

**Reference translation:**
* **Inclusion of the phrase ""जति शेरशाह सूरीका लागि अफगानोंको  साथ""**
* **Use of the phrase ""support of the Mavals"" instead of ""assistant of Mauls""**
* **Use of the phrase ""proved to be as important"" instead of ""became important""**

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The omission of the phrase ""जति शेरशाह सूरीका लागि अफगानोंको  साथ"" is a major deficiency, as it is an important part of the source text. The use of the phrase ""assistant of Mauls"" instead of ""support of the Mavals"" is also problematic, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The use of the phrase ""became important"" instead of ""proved to be as important"" is also a deficiency, as it does not capture the same sense of importance as the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for a translation of the source text, but it needs to be revised to improve the accuracy, precision, and nuance of the reference translation.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Misinterpretation:** The machine translation incorrectly interprets the source text as being about sexual desires rather than genital transformation surgery.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has several grammatical errors, such as the use of the word ""poisoned"" instead of ""heterosexual"" and the incorrect verb conjugation of ""respond.""
* **Lack of clarity:** The machine translation is not clear and concise, and it does not provide any explanation or context for the reader.

**Reference translation:**

* **Accurate translation:** The reference translation accurately translates the source text into English, using the correct terminology and meaning.
* **Clear and concise:** The reference translation is clear and concise, and it provides enough information for the reader to understand the meaning of the text.
* **Explanatory:** The reference translation explains the meaning of the term ""heterosexual"" and provides a clear connection to the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The source text is a Nepali sentence describing the mood of characters in a story. It uses vivid imagery and strong emotional language. The sentence is well-structured and uses a variety of sentence structures to convey the message.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is a literal translation of the source text. It accurately translates the words and phrases from Nepali to English. However, the translation does not capture the nuances of the original text. The sentence structure is simplified and the use of imagery and emotional language is reduced.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is a more nuanced translation of the source text. It captures the mood and atmosphere of the original text more accurately. The translation uses similar imagery and emotional language to the original text. However, the reference translation is slightly longer than the source text and the sentence structure is more complex.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of nuance:** The machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original text. It focuses primarily on translating the words and phrases from Nepali to English, rather than the meaning and intent of the text.
* **Simplified sentence structure:** The machine translation simplifies the sentence structure of the original text. This makes the translation easier to read and understand, but it also loses some of the elegance and beauty of the original text.
* **Lack of emotional language:** The machine translation does not use as much emotional language as the original text. This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the emotional context of the text.
* **Overliteral translation:** The machine translation is sometimes overly literal, which can lead to awkward phrasing and unnatural sentence structure.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not capture the nuances and beauty of the original text. The reference translation is a more nuanced translation that captures the mood and atmosphere of the original text more accurately.**

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Source:**

पछि सन् १९९८मा प्रधानमन्त्री गिरिजाप्रसाद कोइरालाको सरकारले यो सुविधालाई हटायो।

**Machine Translation:**

Later in 1998, the government of Prime Minister George w. Bush removed this facility.

**Reference Translation:**

Later in 1998 , the government of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala removed the privilege .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation (MT) differs from the reference translation (RT) in several ways:

**1. Use of different terminology:**

* **""Sankalp"" (facility) is not translated in MT.** Instead, the word ""facility"" is used, which is not an exact equivalent of ""Sankalp.""
* **""Prime Minister George w. Bush"" is incorrect.** The Prime Minister in 1998 was Girija Prasad Koirala, not George w. Bush.

**2. Different sentence structure:**

* **The sentence structure is different in MT and RT.** The MT sentence is in the third person singular, while the RT sentence is in the third person plural.
* **The use of the word ""privilege"" in RT is not present in MT.** Instead, the word ""facility"" is used.

**3. Lack of precision:**

* **The MT does not specify the ""privilege"" that was removed.** It simply states that the facility was removed.
* **The MT does not mention the year in which the privilege was removed.** It only states ""later in 1998.""

**Overall:**

The MT is not a very accurate translation of the source text. It uses different terminology, has a different sentence structure, and lacks precision. The RT is a more accurate translation that is closer to the original text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** जातकले आफ्ना परिवारजन र खासगरी भाइ र बहिनीसित सम्बद्ध समस्याले सताउने देखनिछ ।

**Machine translation:** Zatak is shown to have survived with his family, and with his brother and sister.

**Reference translation:** It is seen that Jatak harrashes in relation problem with his family and especially with his brother and sisters .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Omits the phrase ""साबद्ध समस्याले"" (related problem).
* Uses the phrase ""survived"" instead of ""seen"" to translate ""दृष्ट"" (seen).
* Does not include the phrase ""साबद्ध समस्याले सताउने"" (survived with).

**Reference translation:**
* Includes the phrase ""साबद्ध समस्याले"" (related problem).
* Uses the phrase ""seen"" to translate ""दृष्ट"" (seen).
* Includes the phrase ""साबद्ध समस्याले सताउने"" (survived with).

**Machine translation:** So lake music came to be born out of the mind of Samstha.

**Meaning:** This translation is incorrect and does not capture the meaning of the source text. The machine translation is only referring to the music of the lake, not the folk songs of the community.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

**Reference translation:** That is why folk songs are born from the heart of the community .

**Meaning:** This translation is accurate and captures the meaning of the source text perfectly. The reference translation is clear, concise, and culturally appropriate.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of understanding:** The machine translation does not understand the meaning of the word ""त्यसैले"" and ""साम्ष्टिका"". The word ""त्यसैले"" is a Nepali word that means ""that is why"", and ""साम्ष्टिका"" is a word that means ""community"". The machine translation does not translate these words correctly.
* **Misinterpretation:** The machine translation misinterprets the source text and focuses on the music of the lake, rather than the folk songs of the community.
* **Lack of cultural understanding:** The machine translation does not understand the cultural context of folk songs in Nepal. Folk songs are an important part of Nepali culture, and they are often used to tell stories about the community.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is of poor quality and does not capture the meaning of the source text accurately. The reference translation is of high quality and captures the meaning of the source text perfectly.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""scored goal in the first four games"" to describe the player's accomplishment.
* Uses the phrase ""Real Madrid of his type"" to emphasize the player's uniqueness.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""By scoring four goals in their first four games"" is a good way to describe the player's accomplishment, but it does not capture the nuance of the phrase ""of his type"" that is used in the reference translation. The use of ""REAL MADRID's soccer team"" is also a good way to specify the team the player is playing for, but it does not capture the same sense of uniqueness as the phrase ""Real Madrid of his type.""

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** तर कुनै प्रकारको वैवाहिक हैसियत परिवर्तनले बच्चाहरुको हित र हैसियतमा असर पार्न सक्दैन ।

**Machine translation:** But no kind of alternative hunting changes can affect children's hunting and hunting.

**Reference translation:** But any change in marital status cannot affect the interests and status of children .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Alternative hunting:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""alternative hunting"" which is not present in the source text. This phrase is a close synonym of ""alternative"" but it does not specifically refer to hunting.
* **Hunting and hunting:** The machine translation repeats the phrase ""hunting and hunting"" which is unnecessary.
* **Can affect:** The machine translation uses the verb ""can affect"" which is a stronger word than the verb ""cannot affect"" used in the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**

* **Marital status:** The reference translation uses the phrase ""marital status"" which is more precise than the phrase "" वैवाहिक हैसियत"" used in the source text.
* **Interests and status:** The reference translation uses the phrase ""interests and status"" which is more specific than the phrase ""हित र हैसियत"" used in the source text.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text as well as the reference translation. The machine translation uses some synonyms and phrases that are not present in the source text, and it also repeats some phrases unnecessarily. The reference translation is more precise and uses more specific language than the machine translation.

The source text is in Nepali and describes the usage of the word ""Gautam"" and ""Buddha"" in the Gautam Gotra.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to translate the source text. However, it is not a very accurate translation. The main problems are:

* **Misinterpretation:** The machine translation incorrectly interprets the word ""Gothic"" as ""Goth"" and ""Gautam Gotra"" as ""Gothic goths.""
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has several grammatical errors, such as the use of the word ""rather than being born"" instead of ""rather than being born from.""
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not provide enough detail or precision, such as the specific location where the word is used.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and provides a more accurate translation of the source text. The main improvements over the machine translation are:

* **Accurate interpretation:** The reference translation correctly interprets the word ""Gautam Gotra"" as ""Gautam Gotra.""
* **Grammatical accuracy:** The reference translation has fewer grammatical errors than the machine translation.
* **Precision:** The reference translation provides more detail and precision, such as the specific location where the word is used.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of much higher quality than the machine translation. It is more accurate, grammatically correct, and provides more precision. The machine translation is not a very accurate translation and has a number of problems, including misinterpretation, grammatical errors, and lack of precision.

The source text is a sentence describing the marital relationships of various individuals. It is written in Nepali and uses some specific cultural references and terminology that may not be familiar to an English speaker.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation attempts to translate the source text into English. It captures the main ideas of the source text but does not preserve the original wording or the cultural references. The language is also somewhat awkward and not very clear.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is a human-translated version of the source text that is more accurate and preserves the original meaning and wording. It also uses more formal language and is more clear and concise.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, ""solidarities"" is used instead of ""Thakuris,"" and ""philosophical relationship"" is used instead of ""marrital relationships.""
* **Syntax:** The machine translation has a different syntax than the reference translation. For example, the sentence structure is changed, and the order of the clauses is rearranged.
* **Cultural references:** The machine translation does not preserve the cultural references in the source text. For example, the references to Tichhadi Malla and the four seahs of guthauri are not included in the machine translation.
* **Language:** The machine translation uses more colloquial language than the reference translation. For example, ""wogatan"" and ""dud"" are used instead of ""Vogtan"" and ""Daud.""

**Overall, the machine translation is able to capture the main ideas of the source text, but it does not preserve the original wording or the cultural references. The reference translation is more accurate and preserves the original meaning and wording of the source text.**

Even so , they have not investigated Devkota 's novel broadly on the basis of Sankhya Philosphy .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The source uses the word ""त्यति"" which is a strong word meaning ""even so"" and is not directly translated in the machine translation.
    * The reference translation uses the word ""even so"" which is a more precise translation of ""त्यति"".
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The source uses a complex sentence structure with a dependent clause ""कहाँ सांख्य दर्शनका आधारमा व्यापक तरिकाले देवकोटाका उपन्यासको विश्लेषण गरेका छैनन्"".
    * The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure and breaks the sentence into two sentences.
    * The reference translation uses a similar sentence structure to the source, but with some minor changes to improve clarity.
* **Word order:**
    * The source has a different word order than the reference translation.
    * The machine translation follows the same word order as the source.
    * The reference translation rearranges the words to improve the flow and clarity of the sentence.

**Step 1: Read the source text.**

The source text is in Nepali and describes the deep influence of politics on the characters in Devakota's novel.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation.**

The machine translation is in English and summarizes the source text. However, it does not capture the nuances of the original text, such as the use of the word ""प्रधान"" (pradhan) and the phrase ""हिन्तेको पाइन्छि भन्ने"" (hinteko piashishi bhanne).

**Step 3: Read the reference translation.**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate translation of the source text. It captures the nuances of the original text, such as the use of the word ""प्रधान"" (pradhan) and the phrase ""हिन्तेको पाइन्छि भन्ने"" (hinteko piashishi bhanne).

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Use of vocabulary:** The machine translation uses simpler vocabulary than the reference translation. For example, the word ""प्रधान"" (pradhan) is translated as ""principal"" in the machine translation, while it is translated as ""Prime Minister"" in the reference translation.
* **Use of phraseology:** The machine translation does not use the same phraseology as the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""हिन्तेको पाइन्छि भन्ने"" (hinteko piashishi bhanne) is translated as ""carrying flags"" in the machine translation, while it is translated as ""found carrying flags"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a different sentence structure than the reference translation. For example, the sentence ""देवकोटाका उपन्यासमा राजनीतिको गहिरो प्रभाव रहेकै कारण पात्रहरू झण्डा नै बोकेर हिँडेको पाइन्छि भन्ने प्रधानको विश्लेषण पनि औचित्यपूर्ण रहेको छ"" is translated as ""In Devakota's novel the deep influence of politics, the analysis of the principle that the characters are carrying flags has also been indicated"" in the machine translation, while it is translated as ""Pradhan 's analysis that the characters are found carrying the flag because of the deep influence of politics in Devkota 's novel is also justified"" in the reference translation.

* **Makes life hellish:** Uses vivid language to describe the negative thinking's impact on life.
* **Intensified negative thinking:** Highlights the intensity of negative thinking making life ""hellish.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

**Machine Translation:**
The translation is grammatically correct and conveys the main idea of the source text. However, it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation. The use of some colloquial language and the focus on the ""living narrative"" may be confusing for some readers.

**Reference Translation:**
The translation is well-written and captures the essence of the source text. It uses clear and concise language and effectively conveys the intensity of negative thinking.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. It is more accurate, precise, and clear in its language. It also better captures the intensity of negative thinking and its impact on life.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Machine translation:** And Hanuman exceeded the sea, and found Zita.

**Reference translation:** Then , Hanuman commited to jump the ocean and return after meeting Sita .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Conciseness:** The reference translation is more concise than the machine translation. The reference translation uses fewer words to convey the same meaning as the machine translation.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses more formal and precise language than the machine translation. For example, the reference translation uses the word ""commited"" instead of ""exceeded"" to convey the idea of Hanuman's determination.
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation. The reference translation uses a compound sentence to convey the idea of Hanuman's commitment to jumping the ocean and returning after meeting Sita.
* **Word order:** The reference translation follows a more logical order of words than the machine translation. The reference translation follows the order of subject, verb, object, and modifier.
* **Cultural nuances:** The reference translation is more sensitive to cultural nuances than the machine translation. The reference translation takes into account the cultural context of the story and uses language that is appropriate for the Nepali audience.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
## Step-by-step evaluation of Nepali-English translation

**1. Read the source:**

The source text is in Nepali and describes a structural study of a novel. It includes the introduction of the novel's author, Devkota.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to translate the source text. However, it does not include the introduction of Devkota. Instead, it introduces the codex.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is in English and accurately translates the source text. It includes the introduction of Devkota and accurately reflects the content of the source text.

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it does not include the introduction of Devkota. Instead, it introduces the codex. This is a major error as the introduction of Devkota is an important part of the source text. The machine translation also uses some incorrect grammar and syntax. For example, the use of the phrase ""with the introduction of the codex"" is not correct. The correct phrase is ""with the introduction of Devkota.""

The reference translation is much closer to the source text in terms of content and grammar. It accurately translates the source text and includes all of the important information. The reference translation also uses more precise language and is more readable than the machine translation.

**Conclusion:**

The quality of the Nepali-English translation is poor. The machine translation is not accurate and does not include important information. The reference translation is much closer to the source text in terms of content and grammar. However, the reference translation could be improved by using more precise language and by being more readable.

- The machine translation uses the term ""gotra laws"" which is not precise and may not be understood by all readers.

**2. Sentence structure:**
- The source uses a complex sentence structure with a long compound predicate.
- The machine translation breaks down the sentence into smaller sentences for clarity.

**3. Word choice:**
- The source uses the word ""विशेषतः"" which is a strong word that emphasizes the basis of the system on the lineage of the four sages.
- The machine translation uses the word ""especially"" which is a weaker word that does not have the same impact.

माओवादी शान्तिप्रक्रियामा आएको झन्डै १० वर्ष पुग्न लाग्दा पनि पासाङले कुनै पनि सुविधाको पद लिनुभएको थिएन।

**Machine Translation:**

Although the pasang had not taken the post of any convenience for nearly 10 years, during the maoist peace response.

**Reference Translation:**

Pasang had not taken any position of privilege even when it had already been almost 10 years that Maoist entered into peace process .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine Translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Post of any convenience"" is not an exact translation of ""कुनै पनि सुविधाको पद"" and does not capture the nuance of the original phrase.
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is different between the source and the machine translation. The source text uses a complex sentence structure with a compound predicate, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a compound predicate.
* **Word order:** The word order is different in the source and the machine translation. In the source text, the words ""केवल"" and ""साथ"" are reversed in the machine translation.
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is different from the source text in several ways, including word choice, sentence structure, word order, and conciseness. The machine translation is also not very clear and concise.

**Step 4: Make recommendations for improvement.**

To improve the quality of the machine translation, the following steps could be taken:

* Use a more accurate translation of ""कुनै पनि सुविधाको पद.""
* Use a more similar sentence structure to the source text.
* Use a more similar word order to the source text.

पूर्णरुपमा अफ्रिकाली राष्ट्रिय पार्टीले सन् १९४८ को चुनाव जितेपछि मण्डेलाले राजनीतिमा सक्रिय रुपमा भाग लिन थाले ।

**Machine translation:**

After the fully elected Africa National Party won the 1948 elections, the assembly actively participated in politics.

**Reference translation:**

After Africa National Party completely won the 1948 elections , Mandela actively participated in politics .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""assembly"" instead of ""Mandela"" to refer to the active participant in politics.
    * The reference translation uses the word ""Mandela"" to specifically refer to Mandela's active participation in politics.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure to make it more concise and less verbose.
    * The reference translation maintains the original sentence structure for clarity and accuracy.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of words to make the sentence flow more smoothly.
    * The reference translation follows the original word order for accuracy and precision.
* **Syntax:**
    * The machine translation uses different syntax than the reference translation to convey the same meaning.
    * The reference translation uses more precise syntax to convey the complex political context.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** यस्तो प्रतिज्ञा गरेर ईन्द्र विवाह स्थलबाट गएका थिए।

**Machine translation:** By this promise the moon went out of the wedding stable.

**Reference translation:** By this promise the Indra went out of the wedding tent .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **The machine translation uses the phrase ""moon went out of the wedding stable"" instead of ""Indra went out of the wedding tent.""** This is a literal translation of the source text, but it does not match the cultural context of the text. In Nepali, the word ""Indra"" is used to refer to the god of thunder, while the word ""moon"" is not used in this sense.
* **The machine translation does not use the word ""by"" in the same way as the reference translation.** The word ""by"" is used in the reference translation to indicate that the Indra went out of the wedding tent as a result of making a promise. The machine translation does not use the word ""by"" in this way.
* **The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation.** The reference translation uses the order ""by this promise the Indra went out of the wedding tent."" The machine translation uses the order ""By this promise the moon went out of the wedding stable.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The quality of the machine translation is poor. The translation is not accurate, and it does not capture the cultural context of the text. The translation is also grammatically incorrect.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a good quality translation of the source text. The translation is inaccurate, and it does not capture the cultural context of the text. The translation is also grammatically incorrect.

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source text:** बालविवाह प्रथा अन्त भएपछि त्यसको प्रतीक स्वरूप ईही गर्ने गरिएको हो।

**Machine translation:** After the end of the child, its symbol is formed.

**Reference translation:** After the abolition of child marriage , Ihi is practised as its symbol .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the relationship between the child marriage abolition and the practice of Ihi. It simply states that the symbol is formed after the end of the child.
* **Lack of clarity:** The machine translation is not clear about the meaning of the word ""Ihi."" It is not clear whether Ihi is a practice that is related to child marriage or a separate practice altogether.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the incorrect verb form ""formed"" and the lack of punctuation.
* **Cultural inaccuracies:** The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of Nepal, where child marriage is a prevalent practice.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It lacks precision, clarity, and grammatical accuracy. It also does not take into account the cultural context of Nepal. The reference translation is of much higher quality. It is more precise, clear, and grammatically correct. It also takes into account the cultural context of Nepal.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** यस यात्रामा २० वटा शोहरू संलग्न थिए र यो शो १९९७मा समाप्त भयो।

**Machine translation:** There were 20 shops involved in this journey and this ended in 1997.

**Reference translation:** The trip involved 20 shows and ended in 1997.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* The use of the word ""shops"" instead of ""shows"" to translate ""शोहरू""
* The omission of the word ""the"" before ""trip""
* The use of the phrase ""this ended"" instead of ""it ended""

**Reference translation:**
* The use of the word ""shows"" instead of ""shops"" to translate ""शोहरू""
* The inclusion of the word ""the"" before ""trip""
* The use of the phrase ""it ended"" instead of ""this ended""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to understand, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The use of the word ""shops"" instead of ""shows"" is a major deviation from the source text, and it is not clear whether the author intended to use that word. The omission of the word ""the"" before ""trip"" is also a deviation from the source text, and it makes the sentence sound incomplete. The use of the phrase ""this ended"" instead of ""it ended"" is a minor deviation from the source text, but it is still noticeable.

**Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved.**

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** उनी पाँच पांड्वहरूकी अर्धांगिनी थिइन्  उनलाई प्राचीनतम नारीवादीहरूमा एक मानिन्छ।

**Machine translation:** She was an ardent woman of five paddies, considered to be one of the ancient narrators.

**Reference translation:** She was wife of the five Pandavas . She is considered as one of the ancient feminists .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Context:** The source text is specific to the Indian epic Mahabharata, while the machine translation does not provide any context or reference to the epic.
* **Terminology:** The source text uses the term ""अर्धांगिनी"" (ardent woman), which is not equivalent to the term ""narrator"" in the machine translation.
* **Gender:** The source text states that the woman is ""अर्धांगिनी,"" which implies that she is a woman of strong passion and determination. The machine translation does not specify the gender of the woman.
* **Purpose:** The source text is written in a literary style, while the machine translation is more concise and formal.
* **Word choice:** The source text uses more vivid and expressive language, while the machine translation uses more common and simple words.

* **Subject:** The source text refers to the division of the Mahabharata epic by sage Vyas in the Dwapar era, while the machine translation incorrectly associates it with the bankruptcy of Dwight Eugene.
* **Context:** The source text is set in the context of the Dwapar era, while the machine translation does not provide any context.
* **Personification:** The source text uses the personification of sage Vyas, while the machine translation does not.
* **Word choice:** The source text uses specific Nepali words, such as ""vyasa"" and ""Dwapar,"" while the machine translation uses English equivalents that may not be exact translations.
* **Sentence structure:** The source text has a different sentence structure than the machine translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is of poor quality. It fails to capture the meaning of the source text accurately and is plagued by errors in subject, context, personification, word choice, and sentence structure.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It is significantly different from the reference translation in many aspects, including the subject, context, personification, word choice, and sentence structure. The poor quality of the translation is likely due to the lack of training data and the complexity of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is in Nepali and describes the significance of the day of Nirjala Ekadashi and its connection to Lord Krishna. It emphasizes the idea that all human activities on this day become inexhaustible.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation attempts to capture the meaning of the source text but lacks accuracy and clarity. It misinterprets the meaning of the word ""axis"" and uses the name ""Mr. Percy"" instead of the actual name ""Krishna.""

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the original text. It correctly translates the meaning of ""Nirjala Ekadashi"" and ""Krishna"" and uses a more nuanced language to describe the activities of humans on this day.

**Analysis of Differences:**

* **Accuracy:** The machine translation deviates from the source text in several places, such as the incorrect translation of ""axis"" and the use of the name ""Mr. Percy"" instead of ""Krishna.""
* **Clarity:** The machine translation is not always clear and concise, making it difficult to understand the meaning of the text.
* **Style:** The machine translation lacks the elegance and style of the original text.
* **Language:** The machine translation uses a more formal and complex language than the original text, which may be difficult for some readers to understand.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not of high quality and does not accurately capture the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is much closer to the original text in terms of accuracy, clarity, and style.

**Recommendations:**

* The machine translation should be improved to be more accurate and closer to the original text.
* The machine translation should be made more clear and concise.
* The machine translation should use a more elegant and stylish language.
* The machine translation should use a more appropriate language for the target audience.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source text:** शरिर हामीलाई आफ्नो गन्तव्य सम्म पुर्याउने माध्यम हो ।

**Machine translation:** Sherrill is the medium to bring us to their destinations.

**Reference translation:** Body is the means by which we reach our destiny .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Use of the word ""Sherrill"":** The word ""Sherrill"" is not present in the source text. It is a substitution for the word ""body"".
* **Use of the word ""destinations"":** The word ""destinations"" is not present in the source text. It is a pluralization of the word ""destination"".
* **Lack of parallelism:** The sentence structure is not parallel to the source text. The source text uses a parallel structure, while the machine translation does not.
* **Use of the word ""medium"":** The word ""medium"" is not present in the source text. It is a substitution for the word ""means"".

**Reference translation:**

* **Use of the word ""body"":** The word ""body"" is used in the same way as in the source text.
* **Use of the word ""destiny"":** The word ""destiny"" is a synonym for the word ""destination"".
* **Parallelism:** The sentence structure is parallel to the source text.
* **Use of the word ""means"":** The word ""means"" is used in the same way as in the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. The most significant differences are the use of different words, the lack of parallelism, and the use of different sentence structure. These differences make the machine translation less accurate and less fluent than the reference translation.

The main issues with the machine translation are the word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text, but it is also more verbose and less concise.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the quality of the Nepali-English translation is good, but it could be improved. The machine translation is a good starting point, but the reference translation is more accurate and captures the nuances of the source text more fully.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Source:**

तर यस्तो अवस्था तामाङ समाजबाट ज्यादै नै अलग्ग भएको परिवारमा मात्र पाइन्छ ।

**Machine Translation:**

But this condition is only found in the family that is very separate from the tamang society.

**Reference Translation:**

But such a condition is found only in families that are very isolated from the Tamang society .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""separate"" instead of ""isolated."" This is a more common word in English, but it does not have the same meaning as ""isolated.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""tamang"" instead of ""Tamang."" This is a mistake, as the Tamang are a specific ethnic group in Nepal, while the word ""tamang"" is not a term used to describe them.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text. The source text is in a simple sentence structure, while the machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure.
    * The machine translation moves the modifier ""that is very separate"" to the end of the sentence. This is not the best placement for the modifier, as it can be confusing.
* **Overall flow:**
    * The machine translation does not flow as well as the reference translation. The source text is written in a very concise and direct manner, while the machine translation is more verbose.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a good translation of the source text. It is different from the reference translation in many ways, including word choice, sentence structure, and overall flow.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:**
 व्यापारमा पनि अगाडि रहेको बेबिलोनियाको सभ्यतामा एसियाका टाढा टाढाका मुलुकमा समेत व्यापार चलेको थियो।

**Machine translation:**
Babylonia's celebration of babylonia, also in front of the trade, was a trade runner in the far east of Asia.

**Reference translation:**
The Babylonian civilization , which was also at the forefront of trade , had trade even in the farthest countries of Asia .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation lacks precision in its wording and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. For example, the phrase ""अगाडि रहेको बेबिलोनियाको सभ्यता"" (Babylonian civilization) is not translated accurately as ""Babylonia's celebration of babylonia."" The machine translation uses the phrase ""Babylonia's celebration of babylonia"" which is not equivalent to the source text.
* **Lack of context:** The machine translation does not provide enough context for the reader. For example, the phrase ""एसियाका टाढा टाढाका मुलुकमा"" (in the farthest countries of Asia) is not translated accurately as ""even in the farthest countries of Asia."" The machine translation does not explain the geographical context of Asia, which is important for understanding the sentence.
* **Use of different vocabulary:** The machine translation uses different vocabulary than the source text. For example, the phrase ""व्यपारमा पनि"" (also in front of the trade) is not translated accurately as ""also in front of the trade."" The machine translation uses the phrase ""also in front of the trade"" which is not equivalent to the source text.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation due to its lack of precision, context, and vocabulary. The machine translation is not able to accurately convey the meaning of the source text and provides a poor translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is in Nepali and describes India as a sacred land for Jainism. It emphasizes the connection between India and the Tirthakshas, highlighting their significance in the religion.

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation attempts to capture the meaning of the source text but fails to convey the cultural and religious context. It uses literal translation of some phrases and does not understand the concept of Tirthakshas or Jainism. The language is also overly negative and uses words like ""deserted"" and ""deserted.""

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is more accurate and culturally sensitive. It translates the source text more closely, using appropriate terminology and language that is more familiar to an English audience. It also explains the connection between India and Jainism in a more concise and clear manner.

**Areas where the Machine Translation differs from the Reference Translation:**

* **Lack of cultural understanding:** The machine translation does not understand the cultural and religious significance of the Tirthakshas or Jainism, which results in a poor translation.
* **Overly literal translation:** The machine translation relies on literal translation of some phrases, which does not always work well in English.
* **Negative language:** The machine translation uses overly negative language, such as ""deserted"" and ""deserted,"" which is not appropriate for the context.
* **Lack of clarity:** The machine translation is not always clear and concise, making it difficult to understand.

**Overall, the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. It is more accurate, culturally sensitive, and conveys the meaning of the source text more effectively.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**1. Read the source text:**

Ravanale āfnon seana tatarbērā ramko seana sanga lādnn pathayāyo, tār ramko seana le Ravanako sabbā seana mārēr syadhīāde.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

Raan sent his army to fight with Raam's army, but Raam's army slew all of Raam's army.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

Ravana prepared his army and sent it to fight with Rama 's army but Rama 's army killed all Ravana 's army .

**4. Compare the machine translation with the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses simpler words like ""army,"" ""fight,"" and ""slew"" while the reference translation uses more precise words like ""prepared,"" ""sent,"" and ""killed.""
    * The machine translation lacks the nuance of the reference translation in terms of word choice.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation follows a simple sentence structure with a clear subject, verb, and object.
    * The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with a more detailed description of the events.
    * The machine translation lacks the flow and rhythm of the reference translation.
* **Syntax:**
    * The machine translation has some syntax errors, such as the incorrect placement of the verb ""slew.""
    * The reference translation has a more accurate syntax.
* **Overall accuracy:**
    * The machine translation is accurate in terms of the main points of the source text, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation.
    * The machine translation is not a faithful translation of the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for translating the source text, but it needs a lot of improvement in terms of word choice, sentence structure, syntax, and overall accuracy. The reference translation is a more accurate and nuanced translation of the source text.

**Source text:** तिमीहरुको आफ्नै मौलिक भाषा तथा सस्कृति झल्किने खास केहि नभेटिएपनि नेपाली समाजमा मनाईने सबै चाडपर्ब नै उनीहरुको प्रमुख चाड हो ।

**Machine translation:** Though there is nothing to do with your own language and culture, all the feasts that are celebrated in the Nepalese language are celebrated.

**Reference translation:** Even if you don 't find anything special that reflects your own original language and culture , all the festivals celebrated in Nepali society are their main festivals .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

* **Lack of specificity:** The machine translation does not specify the ""feasts"" that are celebrated in the Nepalese language, while the reference translation lists them as ""all the festivals.""
* **Lack of connection to the source text:** The machine translation does not explain why the feasts are celebrated in Nepal, while the reference translation connects them to the Nepalese society and culture.
* **Use of colloquial language:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""nothing to do with your own language and culture,"" which is a colloquial expression, while the reference translation uses more formal language.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation states that ""all the feasts that are celebrated in the Nepalese language are celebrated,"" which is not entirely accurate, as there may be some feasts that are specific to Nepal.
* **Use of different sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is not of high quality. It lacks specificity, connection to the source text, precision, and use of correct language. The reference translation is of higher quality as it is more specific, connected to the source text, precise, and uses more formal language.

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is in Nepali and describes a situation where Triple H offered a proposal to the Roman Range but it was rejected.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and accurately summarizes the source text, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the original text in some places.

**Key differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""attach"" instead of ""join"" in the second sentence. This is not an accurate translation as the original text uses ""join"" to describe the relationship between the Roman Range and the Authority.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""offer"" instead of ""proposal"" in the second sentence. This is also not an accurate translation as the original text uses ""proposal"" to describe the offer made by Triple H.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation restructures the second sentence to make it more concise. This is not necessary as the original text is well-structured and does not require restructuring.
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure for the second sentence than the original text. This is not an accurate translation as the original text uses a specific sentence structure to convey the meaning of the second sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the second sentence. This is not an accurate translation as the original text has a specific word order that is important for the meaning of the sentence.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate translation of the source text than the machine translation.

**Key similarities between the reference translation and the source text:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The reference translation uses the same words as the original text in most cases.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The reference translation uses the same sentence structure as the original text.
* **Word order:**
    * The reference translation follows the same word order as the original text.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text than the machine translation. The machine translation makes some inaccurate assumptions about the meaning of the original text and restructures the sentences in a way that is not faithful to the original text.

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

**Source:** खास गरेर मेला महोत्सव र पूजा पाठका बेला धमारी खेल्लने प्रचलन छ ।

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

**Machine translation:** Particularly, Mela is the custom of playing patience during jubilee and worship texts.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

**Reference translation:** Especially during fairs , festivals and poojas , there is a practice of playing Dhamari .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""patience"" instead of ""Dhamari.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""texts"" instead of ""fair, festivals and poojas.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation.
    * The machine translation does not use the phrase ""there is a practice"" as the reference translation does.
* **Cultural understanding:**
    * The machine translation does not understand the cultural context of the source text, which is why it uses the word ""patience"" instead of ""Dhamari.""
    * The machine translation does not understand the relationship between fairs, festivals, poojas and Dhamari, which is why it does not use the phrase ""especially during fairs, festivals and poojas.""

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not of high quality because it does not accurately capture the meaning of the source text. The machine translation is also not well-structured and does not use appropriate vocabulary.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

That same season, the same was halted by the beach hand, and the security forces of WWII separated the two by aid there.

**Reference Translation:**

During this course there was fight between them and security officials of WWE had to separate them by going there .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""beach hand"" instead of ""fight"" in the source. This is a common error in machine translation, where the translator may not be able to find the exact equivalent of a word in the target language and substitutes a similar word instead.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""aid"" instead of ""going there"" in the source. This is also a common error in machine translation, where the translator may not be able to find the exact synonym of a word in the target language and substitutes a similar word instead.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source to a more complex structure. This is because the machine translator may not be able to find the exact sentence structure in the target language and substitutes a similar structure instead.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""by going there"" to the end of the sentence. This is not the same as the source, where the phrase is placed after the verb ""separated.""

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the meaning of the source text, but it does not do a very good job of preserving the original sentence structure and word choice. This is because the machine translator is not able to find the exact equivalent of many words and phrases in the target language.

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** प्रकाशित स्रोतहरुमा पुस्तक, ग्रन्थ, पुस्तिका, पर्चा, पैम्फलेट इत्यादि पर्दछन् ।

**Machine translation:** Published sources include books, bibliographies, books, percussion, paimphlets, etc.

**Reference translation:** The published resources include books , texts , pamphlets , etc .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""books"" instead of ""पुस्तक"" and ""percussion"" instead of ""पर्चा"". These words are not exact translations of the Nepali words and do not capture their meaning precisely.
    * The reference translation uses more precise words like ""texts"" and ""pamphlets"" to match the Nepali words "" ग्रन्थ"" and ""पुस्तिका"".
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a more formal sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more conversational tone.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation often changes the order of words in the sentence to fit the English grammar.
    * The reference translation maintains the original word order of the Nepali text.
* **Cultural references:**
    * The machine translation does not include any cultural references that are specific to Nepal.
    * The reference translation includes some cultural references that are specific to Nepal, such as the use of the word ""स्रोत"" (source).

**Overall, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. The main differences are in word choice, sentence structure, word order, and cultural references.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is in Nepali and describes the position of the Home Minister of Sikkim and the Governor's Residence in relation to other states in India.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation accurately captures the main points of the source text, but it does not maintain the same structure and style as the original text. The use of some jargon like ""governor-general"" and ""governorate ruling monarchy"" may be confusing for some readers.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is more faithful to the structure and style of the original text, but it does not include the phrase ""similar to other states in India."" This phrase is important because it emphasizes the similarity of Sikkim's position to other states in India.

**Analysis of differences:**

* **Structure:**
    * The source text has a more concise structure, while the machine translation and reference translation are more verbose.
    * The source text uses a more formal tone, while the machine translation and reference translation use a more conversational tone.
* **Style:**
    * The source text has a more formal style, while the machine translation and reference translation have a more casual style.
    * The source text uses more precise language, while the machine translation and reference translation use more general language.
* **Content:**
    * The source text includes the phrase ""similar to other states in India,"" which emphasizes the similarity of Sikkim's position to other states.
    * The machine translation does not include this phrase.
    * The reference translation includes the phrase ""similar to other states in India,"" but it does not use the same phrasing as the source text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main points of the source text, but it does not maintain the same structure and style as the original text. The reference translation is more faithful to the structure and style of the original text, but it does not include the phrase ""similar to other states in India.""

**Recommendations:**

* To improve the quality of the machine translation, the translator could use a more formal tone and use more precise language.
* To improve the quality of the reference translation, the translator could include the phrase ""similar to other states in India"" in a more similar way to the source text.

During Rana's reign, the question of language, religion, culture, and the question of development was a serious crime.

**Reference translation:**
During the Rana rule , the question of preservation and development of language , religion , literature and culture was similar to grave crime .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""serious crime"" to describe the question of development.
* Does not mention the preservation of language and culture.
* Does not use the phrase ""similar to grave crime"" to describe the question of development.
* Does not specify the Rana rule.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""preservation and development"" instead of ""question of preservation and development.""
* Mentions the preservation of language and culture.
* Uses the phrase ""similar to grave crime"" to describe the question of development.
* Specifies the Rana rule.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""serious crime"" is a bit too strong, and it does not capture the idea of the preservation of language and culture. The lack of specificity in the machine translation also makes it difficult to understand.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is of high quality. It is accurate, precise, and nuanced. The use of the phrase ""preservation and development"" is well-chosen, and it captures the idea of the preservation and development of language and culture. The reference translation is also well-structured and easy to read.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it is not as high as the quality of the reference translation. The machine translation lacks precision, nuance, and specificity. The reference translation is more accurate, precise, and nuanced.

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** हिन्दू धर्मको पवित्र ग्रन्थ मानिएको वेद ब्रह्माजीको वाक्य भनिएको छ ।

**Machine translation:** The Wedding Brahmaji, which is considered the holy grant of Hinduism, is called the synod of brahmaji.

**Reference translation:** The Vedas are considered to be the holy scriptures of Hinduism .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Misinterpretation:** The machine translation incorrectly interprets the source text ""वेद ब्रह्माजीको वाक्य भनिएको छ"" as ""The Wedding Brahmaji."" This is not accurate. The Vedas are not specifically related to the Wedding Brahmaji.
* **Lack of context:** The machine translation does not provide enough context about the Vedas or Hinduism. It simply states that the Vedas are considered holy scriptures without explaining their significance or purpose.
* **Unnecessary terminology:** The machine translation uses the term ""synod"" which is not appropriate in this context. The Vedas are not a synod of any organization.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality due to its inaccuracies, lack of context and inappropriate terminology. It does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and fails to provide sufficient information about the Vedas or Hinduism.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It is marred by inaccuracies, lack of context and inappropriate terminology. The reference translation is a much more accurate and comprehensive translation that provides more information about the Vedas and Hinduism.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** पञ्चायती शासनकालको अन्धकारमय समयमा शासकहरू मस्ती लुटिरहेका थिए भने जनता अबुझ खसीबोकाझैँ डोहोरिरहन्थे।

**Machine translation:** During the darkness of the fifty reigns, the rulers were spoiling the slain, and the people were robbed of Abuzh Khashiboka.

**Reference translation:** In the dark days of the Panchayat rule , the rulers were enjoying all privileges while the people were guided like ignorent goats .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""slain"" instead of ""killed"" in the source text. This is a difference in word choice that is due to the different cultural contexts in which the two languages are used. In Nepali, the word ""killed"" is more common, while in English, the word ""slain"" is more formal and literary.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the source text. The source text uses a complex sentence structure with a long subordinate clause. The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a shorter subordinate clause. This is due to the different grammatical rules that govern sentence structure in Nepali and English.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the source text. The source text follows the SVO (subject-verb-object) order, while the machine translation follows the VSO (verb-subject-object) order. This is due to the different word order rules that govern sentence structure in Nepali and English.
* **Style:** The machine translation has a more formal style than the source text. The source text is written in a more conversational style. This is due to the different cultural norms for writing style in Nepali and English.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written, but it does have some errors. The main errors are the word choice errors, the sentence structure errors, and the word order errors. These errors are due to the different cultural contexts in which the two languages are used, the different grammatical rules that govern sentence structure in Nepali and English, and the different word order rules that govern sentence structure in Nepali and English.

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** जीवनका प्रारम्भिक दिन र जीवनका अन्तिम दिनका घटनाहरूमा पनि समानता पाइन्छ।

**Machine translation:** Equivalent to the early days of life and the last days of life events are also found.

**Reference translation:** Similarity in early days of life and the last days of life events are also found .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""equivalent to"" which is not as precise as the reference translation's ""similarity.""
* **Missing nuances:** The machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original text such as the connection between the early and last days of life.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors such as the incorrect use of the verb ""found.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation such as ""events"" instead of ""occurrences.""
* **Lack of flow:** The machine translation does not have the same flow as the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It lacks precision, accuracy, and fluency. The use of incorrect grammar and word choice also detracts from the quality of the translation.

**Step 4: Compare the reference translation to the source text.**

The reference translation is of much higher quality than the machine translation. It captures the nuances of the original text and uses precise language. The flow of the translation is also very similar to the original text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. The reference translation is much closer to the original text in terms of accuracy, precision, and fluency.

**Source:** सन २०१४ को विश्वकपमा पोर्चुगलको सम्पुर्ण आशा रोनाल्डोमाथि केन्द्रित थियो।

**Machine translation:** As of 2014, the complete hope of Portugal in the world was centered on Ronaldo.

**Reference translation:** Portugal had all its hopes on Ronaldo in 2014 World Cup .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""As of 2014"" to specify the time frame.
- Uses the phrase ""complete hope"" to emphasize the magnitude of Portugal's hopes.
- Does not mention the World Cup explicitly.
- Uses the pronoun ""on Ronaldo"" to show that Ronaldo is the focus of the hope.

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""in 2014 World Cup"" to specify the time frame and event.
- Uses the phrase ""had all its hopes on Ronaldo"" to show that Portugal's hopes were entirely on Ronaldo.

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:**

भगवान् रामको जीवनमा घटित घटनाहरूले हनुमानको व्यक्तित्व विशेषताहरूले उनलाई सर्व प्रतिष्ठित 'देव' बनाइदियो।

**Machine Translation:**

The events that happened in the life of the goddess ram made hanuman's personality attributes to him the best performed ' Deva '.

**Reference Translation:**

The events of God Ram 's life and personality traits of Hanuman made him prestigious God .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Use of gender:**

* The source text uses the masculine pronoun "" Ram"" while the machine translation uses the feminine pronoun ""goddess ram.""
* This is a gender error and should be corrected.

**2. Use of terminology:**

* The source text uses the term ""भगवान्"" (God) while the machine translation uses the term ""goddess ram.""
* The term ""goddess ram"" is not appropriate in this context and should be corrected to ""God Ram.""

**3. Use of adjectives:**

* The source text uses the adjective ""सर्व प्रतिष्ठित"" (prestigious) while the machine translation uses the adjective ""best performed.""
* The adjective ""best performed"" is not appropriate in this context and should be corrected to ""prestigious.""

**4. Sentence structure:**

* The source text uses a complex sentence structure while the machine translation uses a simpler structure.
* This is due to the difference in language structure between Nepali and English. The sentence structure can be simplified without losing the meaning of the text.

**Step 3: Revise the machine translation:**

तर हिजोआज आधुनिक शैली र डिजाईनका पहिरनको प्रभावले यस्ता भेषभुषा धारण गर्नेहरू कमैमात्र भेटिन्छन् ।

**Machine translation:**
But yesterday, the influence of clothing of modern styles and designs is found in little those who wear such illustrations.

**Reference translation:**
But such dresses are rare these days due to the influence of modern style and designs .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""yesterday"" instead of ""these days"" to indicate the time frame.
* Replaces ""केमैमात्र"" with ""little"" to convey the idea of rarity.
* Uses the phrase ""illustrations"" instead of ""dress"" to refer to the clothing.
* Changes the sentence structure to a more formal tone.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""these days"" to indicate the time frame.
* Replaces ""केमैमात्र"" with ""rare"" to convey the idea of rarity.
* Uses the word ""dress"" instead of ""illustrations"" to refer to the clothing.
* Maintains the original sentence structure.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** यहाँ ती नगरको सन् २००५को अनुमानमा आधारित जनसङ्ख्या समेत दिइएको छ ।

**Machine translation:** Here is a population plaintiff based on the 2005 estimate of those municipalities.

**Reference translation:** Here is a population statistics of those municipalities based on the 2005 estimate .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the term ""plaintiff"" instead of ""statistics.""
- Does not mention ""municipalities"" explicitly.
- Does not use the phrase ""based on the 2005 estimate.""

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the term ""statistics"" instead of ""plaintiff.""
- Mentions ""municipalities"" explicitly.
- Uses the phrase ""based on the 2005 estimate.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to understand, but it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The use of the term ""plaintiff"" is inappropriate, and the lack of mention of ""municipalities"" makes the translation incomplete. The machine translation also lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is well-written and accurate, but it could be improved. The use of the phrase ""based on the 2005 estimate"" is a bit redundant, and the lack of a clear call to action at the end of the sentence makes it incomplete.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for a translation, but it needs to be revised to improve the accuracy and precision of the text. The reference translation is a better overall translation, but it could also be improved by making the language more concise and by adding a clear call to action at the end of the sentence.

**Source text:** उनको योगदानका कारणले उनी यस देशका राष्ट्रिय विभूति बनेका छन्।

**Machine translation:** Due to his contributions, he has become a national defender of this country.

**Reference translation:** Due to his contribution , he has become a national icon of this country .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **National defender vs. National icon:** The machine translation uses the term ""national defender,"" while the reference translation uses the term ""national icon."" National defender is a more specific term that refers to someone who defends their country in battle, while national icon is a more general term that refers to someone who is admired for their achievements or contributions to their country.
* **Contributions vs. contribution:** The machine translation uses the plural form ""contributions,"" while the reference translation uses the singular form ""contribution."" This is because the reference translation is more precise and emphasizes the single act of contribution that led to the person becoming a national icon.
* **Formal vs. informal language:** The reference translation uses more formal language, while the machine translation uses more informal language. This is because the reference translation is more official and serious, while the machine translation is more conversational and friendly.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is not of high quality. It is different from the reference translation in several ways, including the use of different terms, the use of different grammar, and the use of different language style. These differences make the machine translation less accurate and less faithful to the original text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a good quality translation of the source text. It is different from the reference translation in several ways, and these differences make the machine translation less accurate and less faithful to the original text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is a Nepali sentence that describes a story about Lord Krishna's father Vasudev going to ask for the marriage proposal of Devki, sister of Kansh.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is a translation of the source text into English. It is mostly accurate, but it lacks some of the nuances of the original text. For example, the machine translation does not mention the fact that Devaki is Kansh's sister, and it also does not mention the purpose of Vasudev's visit to Mathura.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text into English. It includes all of the nuances of the original text, such as the fact that Devaki is Kansh's sister and the purpose of Vasudev's visit to Mathura.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not mention the fact that Devaki is Kansh's sister, and it also does not mention the purpose of Vasudev's visit to Mathura.
* **Use of different vocabulary:** The machine translation uses different vocabulary than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the word ""song"" instead of ""story,"" and the machine translation uses the word ""proposal"" instead of ""marriage proposal.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a different sentence structure than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure to describe the story, while the reference translation uses a more concise sentence structure.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks some of the nuances of the original text. The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text into English.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a legal document written in Nepali. It uses formal language and specific legal terminology related to property transfer and taxation. The text is also clear and concise, but it can be difficult for some English speakers to understand due to the use of some complex legal terms.

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation is well-structured and easy to read. However, it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text in some places. For example, the machine translation uses the phrase ""nonprofessional taxable property"" instead of the more precise term ""non-commercial taxable property"" used in the source text. This is because the machine translation does not have access to the specific legal terminology used in the source text.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation. It uses the same terminology as the source text and is also well-structured. However, the reference translation is slightly more verbose than the source text. This is because the reference translator has added some additional details to the translation in order to make it more clear and concise.

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Overall, the quality of the Nepali-English translation is good, but it could be improved. The machine translation is well-structured and easy to read, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text in some places. The reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation, but it is also more verbose.

**Recommendations:**

* The translator should use more specific legal terminology used in the source text.
* The translator should be more careful to capture the exact meaning of the source text.
* The translator should use a more concise and clear writing style.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** निजीवनका अतिरिक्त खरवनी, लगायतका केही रानीवन अर्थात् पर्ती वनहरू पनि रहेका छन्।

**Machine translation:** In addition to private purchases, there are also some queens, or perennial plants.

**Reference translation:** In addition to private forests , there are also some queen forests i.e. Parti forests .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Context:** The source text is about the additional forests in Nepal, which are known as queen forests. The machine translation does not mention the context of the text, and instead focuses on the concept of queens and perennial plants.
* **Terminology:** The source text uses the term ""खरवनी"" which is a Nepali term for forest. The machine translation uses the term ""perennial plants"" which is not equivalent to ""खरवनी.""
* **Word choice:** The source text uses the word ""अर्थात्"" which means ""that is"" to clarify the relationship between the queen forests and the private forests. The machine translation does not use this word.
* **Sentence structure:** The source text uses a complex sentence structure with a compound predicate. The machine translation simplifies the sentence structure and uses a more direct translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality because it does not capture the context of the source text, uses different terminology, and has a different sentence structure. The translation is also not very clear and concise.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** 
यसका लागि पत्रपत्रिकामा र श्रव्यदृश्य सामग्री मार्फत सार्वजनि गर्नु पर्छ ।

**Machine translation:**
Must be moved through the magazine and audience content for it.

**Reference translation:**
This should be made public through the newspaper and audiovisual .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""move"" instead of ""make public"" in the reference translation. ""Move"" is not an appropriate synonym for ""make public"" in this context.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""audience content"" instead of ""newspaper and audiovisual."" ""Audience content"" is not a specific enough term in this context.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text significantly. The source text is a single sentence, while the machine translation splits the sentence into two sentences.
    * The machine translation uses a different word order than the source text.
* **Grammatical errors:**
    * The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the incorrect verb tense.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is not able to capture the nuances of the source text and the translation is not very clear or accurate. The use of incorrect word choice, sentence structure, and grammar errors further detracts from the quality of the translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It is not able to capture the meaning of the source text accurately and the translation is not of high quality.

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The source text is a Nepali sentence that uses the word ""Sauvi"" to encourage dancers. The sentence is concise and uses idiomatic language.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation accurately translates the source text, but it does not capture the idiomatic nature of the original sentence. The translation is also a bit verbose and does not flow as well as the original text.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the source text. It uses the same phrase ""Sauvi"" and also captures the rhythm and flow of the original sentence.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of idiomatic language:** The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic nature of the original sentence. The phrase ""Sauvi..."" is an idiom in Nepali that is used to encourage people. The machine translation simply translates the phrase word-for-word, which does not make sense in English.
* **Verbosity:** The machine translation is verbose and uses more words than the original text. This is because the machine translation is trying to translate all of the nuances of the original sentence, which results in a more complex and wordy translation.
* **Lack of flow:** The machine translation does not flow as well as the original text. This is because the machine translation does not take into account the rhythm and flow of the original sentence.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not capture the idiomatic nature of the original sentence, the verbosity, and the lack of flow. The reference translation is a more accurate and idiomatic translation of the source text.

**Source:** बौद्ध धर्मका प्रवर्तक गौतम बुद्ध आफ्नो अन्तिम दिनहरूमा यहाँबाट गएका थिए।

**Machine translation:** The Prominent Gautama Buddha of Buddhism went from here in his last days.

**Reference translation:** Gautama Buddha , the founder of Buddhism , had gone from here in his last days .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""Prominent Gautama Buddha"" instead of ""Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism.""
- Omits the phrase ""had gone"" and uses ""went"" instead.
- Does not specify the location of ""here.""

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism"" to clarify the identity of Gautama Buddha.
- Uses the phrase ""had gone"" to emphasize that Gautama Buddha had departed from the world.
- Specifies the location of ""here"" as unspecified.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to understand, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""Prominent Gautama Buddha"" is inappropriate, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The omission of the phrase ""had gone"" also affects the accuracy of the translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is in Nepali and describes the first chapter of the Arjuna Vishadyoga chapter in the Bhagavad Gita. It states that the chapter is named after Arjuna's expression of regret in the first chapter.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to translate the source text. However, it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The translation is not clear and uses some incorrect assumptions.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and provides a more accurate translation of the source text. It correctly states that other verses are also used in the paragraphs like Stuti and that the chapter is named after Arjuna's expression of regret in the first chapter.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of clarity:** The machine translation is not clear and uses some ambiguous language. For example, the phrase ""other issues in its first chapter called the argus poetic chapter"" is not clear. It is not clear what ""other issues"" refers to and what the ""argus poetic chapter"" is.
* **Incorrect assumptions:** The machine translation makes some incorrect assumptions. For example, it assumes that the chapter is named after the expression of regret in the first chapter. This is not true. The chapter is named after the topic of the chapter, which is Arjuna's conversation with Krishna.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. For example, the phrase ""अर्जुनले खेद व्यक्त गरेको हुनाले"" is not translated accurately. This phrase means ""Arjuna expressed regret because of this."" The machine translation translates this phrase as ""Arjuna expressed regret in its first chapter.""

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a good quality translation of the source text. It lacks clarity, makes incorrect assumptions, and does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The reference translation is a much better quality translation of the source text. It is clear, accurate, and captures the exact meaning of the source text.

**Source:** यस्तो अवस्थामा जातकसँग धनदौलथ र वैभवको कुनै कमी हुँदैन।

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

**Machine translation:** In this case, there is no duty of wealth and experience with the government.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

**Reference translation:** In this case , there is no lack of wealth and splendor with the newborn .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways.

* **Focus:** The machine translation focuses primarily on the lack of duty of wealth and experience with the government, while the reference translation focuses on the lack of wealth and splendor with the newborn.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""duty"" while the reference translation uses the word ""lack.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation.
* **Cultural references:** The machine translation does not include any cultural references, while the reference translation includes references to Nepali culture.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not a very accurate translation of the source text. It is missing some of the nuances of the original text and the translation is not very clear. The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text, but it does not use the same language as the original text.

**Recommendations:**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** यही कोदारी राजमार्ग अहिले हाम्रा लागि एउटा आशा बनिरहेको छ ।

**Machine translation:** The same Kodari Kingdom is now becoming a hope for us.

**Reference translation:** This Kodari highway is becoming a hope for us now .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Thematic shift:** The machine translation shifts the focus from the highway to the Kodari Kingdom, making it seem like the highway is the source of hope.
* **Word choice:** The use of ""Kingdom"" instead of ""highway"" is a significant difference. The word ""Kingdom"" is more grandiose and suggests a sense of strength and stability, while ""highway"" is more practical and accessible.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation, making the sentence more concise and direct.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation lacks the precision of the reference translation, as it does not specify the location of the Kodari Highway or the reason why it is becoming a hope.

**Reference translation:**

* **Specific focus:** The reference translation focuses on the highway as the source of hope, highlighting its importance for the people.
* **Word choice:** The use of ""highway"" accurately reflects the nature of the infrastructure.
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure, which allows for a more detailed description of the highway and its significance.
* **Precision:** The reference translation is more precise, specifying the location of the highway and explaining why it is becoming a hope.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and conveys the main idea of the source text, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation. The thematic shift and the use of different word choice and sentence structure are the most significant issues with the machine translation.

**Conclusion:**

While the machine translation is a good attempt to translate the source text, it does not match the quality of the reference translation. The reference translation is more precise, accurate, and faithful to the original text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

The source text is a call to action for Nepali people to rise up against injustice. It uses strong language and imagery to evoke a sense of urgency and purpose.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but it lacks the emotional impact and precision of the reference translation. The language is more direct and literal, and it does not use the same level of imagery or figurative language.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is more nuanced and elegant than the machine translation. It uses more sophisticated language and imagery to convey the same message as the source text. It also captures the emotional tone of the source text more effectively.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of emotional impact:** The machine translation does not convey the same sense of urgency and purpose as the source text or the reference translation.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not use the same level of precision as the reference translation. It is more likely to make errors in grammar and syntax.
* **Lack of imagery:** The machine translation does not use the same level of imagery as the source text or the reference translation.
* **Direct and literal:** The machine translation is more direct and literal, while the reference translation is more nuanced and elegant.
* **Lack of figurative language:** The machine translation does not use any figurative language, while the reference translation uses some figurative language to convey the same message.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good attempt to translate the source text, but it lacks the emotional impact, precision, and imagery of the reference translation. The reference translation is a more accurate and nuanced translation that captures the emotional tone and style of the source text more effectively.

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is a statement about the Tamang people and their relationship with the Gonma people. It says that the Tamangs do not hate the Gonmas and that it is not possible to confirm that everyone eats them.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the exact meaning of the original text. The machine translation uses the phrase ""constituents"" instead of ""concepts,"" and it also uses the phrase ""eaten by all"" to generalize the situation.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is more accurate to the source text than the machine translation. It uses the phrase ""concepts"" instead of ""constituents,"" and it also uses the phrase ""cannot be confirmed"" to emphasize the uncertainty of the statement.

**Analysis of differences:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""constituents"" instead of ""concepts,"" which is not a precise translation of the original text.
* **Generalization:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""eaten by all,"" which is a generalization of the original text.
* **Certainty:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""cannot be solidified"" to express uncertainty, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""cannot be confirmed"" to express the same uncertainty.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the exact meaning of the original text. The reference translation is more accurate to the source text than the machine translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is in Nepali and describes the plight of people who have been displaced from their animal husbandry business and are now working as wage laborers and watchmen in neighboring India.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to translate the source text. However, it is not very accurate and does not capture the nuances of the original text.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate translation of the source text. It captures the main points of the source text and uses clear and concise language.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not use precise language and often uses synonyms that are not appropriate. For example, the phrase ""business becomes hired"" is not precise and could be replaced with a more specific phrase, such as ""business is transferred.""
* **Lack of clarity:** The machine translation is not always clear and can be difficult to understand. For example, the phrase ""after that the business becomes hired in the neighborhood"" is not clear and could be rephrased to make it more clear.
* **Use of jargon:** The machine translation uses some jargon that is not familiar to the average reader. For example, the phrase ""Bibsh"" is a term that is not commonly used in English.
* **Lack of cultural awareness:** The machine translation does not take into account the cultural context of Nepal. For example, the phrase ""alternative employment"" does not account for the fact that in Nepal, alternative employment is often a necessity rather than a choice.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a very accurate translation of the source text and does not capture the nuances of the original text. The reference translation is a more accurate and concise translation that captures the main points of the source text and uses clear and concise language.

* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a more direct sentence structure. This is because the machine translator may have wanted to simplify the sentence structure for English speakers.
    * The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure. This is because the reference translator may have wanted to preserve the original sentence structure of the source text.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence. This is because the machine translator may have wanted to make the sentence structure more logical for English speakers.
    * The reference translation preserves the order of the words in the sentence. This is because the reference translator may have wanted to preserve the original word order of the source text.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style. This is because the machine translator may have wanted to make the language more professional.
    * The reference translation has a more conversational style. This is because the reference translator may have wanted to make the language more readable.

## Conclusion

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways. These differences are due to the different ways in which the machine translator and the reference translator have interpreted the source text. The machine translator has focused on making the translation as accurate as possible, while the reference translator has focused on making the translation as readable and clear as possible.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:**
यसरी कृष्णभावनामा सन्तुष्ट रहने व्यक्तिका लागि संसारका तीनै किसिमका भौतिक कष्टहरु धेरै टिक्दैनन्।

**Machine translation:**
Thus the physical troubles of the world for those who are satisfied with the potential do not pick up much.

**Reference translation:**
Thus for a person who is satisfied with Krishna consciousness , all the three kinds of material sufferings in the world do not last long .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""potential"" instead of ""Krishna consciousness.""
* Does not mention the connection between satisfaction and Krishna consciousness.
* Does not specify the ""three kinds of material sufferings.""
* Uses the phrase ""pick up much"" instead of ""last long.""

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""Krishna consciousness"" instead of ""potential.""
* Explains the connection between satisfaction and Krishna consciousness.
* Specifies the ""three kinds of material sufferings.""
* Uses the phrase ""last long"" instead of ""pick up much.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""potential"" instead of ""Krishna consciousness"" is a major deviation from the source text, and it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. The lack of connection between satisfaction and Krishna consciousness is also a major issue. Overall, the machine translation is a good but not perfect translation of the source text.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is a more accurate and precise translation of the source text. The use of the phrase ""Krishna consciousness"" instead of ""potential"" is a more faithful translation of the original text. The explanation of the connection between satisfaction and Krishna consciousness is also well-written. Overall, the reference translation is a superior translation of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The source text is in Nepali and describes the inclusion of the latest research journal in a study. It uses the phrase ""त्यसैले सबभन्दा नयां शोध पत्रिकालाई अध्ययनमा समावेश गर्दा"" which translates to ""Therefore , when the latest research journal is included in the study ,"".

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to translate the source text. However, it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text and instead uses the phrase ""the newest sorority magazine"" which is not related to the source text.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is in English and accurately translates the source text. It uses the phrase ""Therefore , when the latest research journal is included in the study , its technical aspects are also known"" which is similar to the source text.

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The machine translation uses a different phrase (""the newest sorority magazine"") than the source text (""त्यसैले सबभन्दा नयां शोध पत्रिकालाई अध्ययनमा समावेश गर्दा""). This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the context of the source text and instead relies on its own internal dictionary of words.

The reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation because it is able to understand the context of the source text and use similar phrasing to the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The quality of the Nepali-English translation is poor. The machine translation is not able to capture the exact meaning of the source text and the reference translation is more accurate.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is in Nepali and describes a situation where a short-term average cost line touches a long-term average cost line at its minimum point.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some differences from the reference translation.

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""shorter"" instead of ""short"" in the phrase ""one shorter average cost line."" This is a minor difference that does not affect the meaning of the text.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""touches"" instead of ""touches minimum point"" in the phrase ""touches the minimum point of the elliptical average cost line."" This is a more significant difference that changes the meaning of the text slightly.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation restructures the sentence ""And proved that the minimum point of only one short-term average cost line touches minimum point of the long-term average cost line"" into two sentences: ""And only one shorter average cost line proved that the minimum point of the elliptical average cost line touches the minimum point of the elliptical average cost line."" This is a minor change that does not affect the meaning of the text.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is the most accurate translation of the source text. It uses the same word choice and sentence structure as the original text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some differences from the reference translation that change the meaning of the text slightly. The main differences are the word choice for ""shorter"" and ""touches"" and the sentence structure.

**Overall, the quality of the Nepali-English translation is good, but it could be improved.**

## Step-by-step evaluation of Nepali-English translation

**1. Read the source:**

The source text is in Nepali and describes a person named Levesque being a fan of the Motorhead musical group and the music they have provided in WWE.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation accurately summarizes the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original language. The phrase ""लेवेस्क मोटरहेड साङ्गीतिक समूहका ठूलो अनुयायी हुन्"" is translated as ""Lewesk is a large follower of the motörhead musical group."" This translation is grammatically correct, but it does not capture the sense of enthusiasm and passion that is conveyed in the original text.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is more faithful to the original text than the machine translation. It accurately translates the phrase ""लेवेस्क मोटरहेड साङ्गीतिक समूहका ठूलो अनुयायी हुन्"" as ""Levesque is a great fan of the Motorhead musical group."" However, the reference translation could be improved by using more vivid language and by capturing the sense of enthusiasm and passion that is conveyed in the original text.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of nuance:** The machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original text. For example, the phrase ""साङ्गीतिक समूहका ठूलो अनुयायी हुन्"" is translated as ""large follower,"" which does not convey the same sense of passion and enthusiasm as the original phrase.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the incorrect verb form ""give"" in the sentence ""उनको लागि डब्ल्यूडब्ल्यूईमा तीन वटा फरकफरक प्रवेश सङ्गीत दिएका छन्.""
* **Lack of creativity:** The machine translation is not very creative. It simply summarizes the source text without adding any of its own ideas or insights.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good summary of the source text, but it does not capture the nuances and passion of the original language. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text, but it could be improved by using more vivid language and by capturing the sense of enthusiasm and passion that is conveyed in the original text.**

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is in Nepali and describes the division of Bhossi processions into two camps. It uses the phrase ""भोस्सी जात्राहरु"" which is a specific term used in Nepal for the processions of the Bhossi community.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation accurately captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not use the specific term ""भोस्सी जात्राहरु."" Instead, it uses the general term ""goals"" which is not appropriate in this context.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text. It uses the specific term ""Bhossi processions"" and also captures the nuances of the sentence structure and meaning.

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it does not use the specific term ""भोस्सी जात्राहरु"" and also does not capture the full meaning of the sentence structure. The reference translation is more accurate as it uses the specific term and also captures the nuances of the sentence structure and meaning.

**Conclusion:**

The quality of the Nepali-English translation can be improved by using the specific term ""भोस्सी जात्राहरु"" and by capturing the full meaning of the sentence structure.

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is a simple sentence describing the former administrative unit of Dolakha in Nepal. It is clear, concise, and direct.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the source text. It also uses some incorrect terminology, such as ""w. 2018 Summit"" instead of ""2018 B.S.""

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of accuracy, precision, and clarity. It also uses the correct terminology.

**Analysis of Differences:**

* **Conciseness:** The source text is more concise than the reference translation. The reference translation includes unnecessary details, such as ""No. 2"" and ""before 2007 and until 2018 B.S.""
* **Precision:** The reference translation is more precise than the machine translation. The machine translation uses some imprecise phrasing, such as ""east 2 Nmber Goshawks administrative unit.""
* **Clarity:** The source text and the reference translation are both clear and easy to understand. The machine translation is a bit less clear due to the use of some jargon and imprecise phrasing.
* **Terminology:** The machine translation uses some incorrect terminology, such as ""w. 2018 Summit"" instead of ""2018 B.S."" The reference translation uses the correct terminology.

**Overall:**

The reference translation is the best translation of the source text, as it is the most accurate, precise, and clear. The machine translation is a good translation, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the source text.

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:**

रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चको दवावपूर्ण विरोध हुँदाहुँदै स्पेनले वैवाहिक समानतालाई मान्यता दिने गरी कानुन बनायो ।

**Machine Translation:**

During the suppression of the Roman Catholic Church, Spain made laws regarding religious equality.

**Reference Translation:**

Spain made a law to give equal recognition to marriage despite strong criticism of Roman Catholic churches.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine Translation:**

* **Omission:** The phrase ""despite strong criticism"" is omitted.
* **Oversimplification:** The phrase ""during the suppression of the Roman Catholic Church"" is oversimplified.
* **Lack of precision:** The phrase ""religious equality"" is not precise enough. It does not specify which religious groups are included.
* **Word choice:** The word ""suppression"" is a strong word that is not appropriate in this context. A more neutral word, such as ""controversy"" or ""opposition,"" would be more appropriate.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks precision and clarity. The omission of important phrases, the oversimplification of complex phrases, and the lack of precision all contribute to the overall low quality of the translation.

**Step 4: Recommendations for improvement.**

To improve the quality of the translation, the following steps could be taken:

* Add the missing phrase ""despite strong criticism.""
* Simplify the phrase ""during the suppression of the Roman Catholic Church"" into a more concise and accurate phrase.
* Be more precise in the phrase ""religious equality"" to specify which religious groups are included.
* Use a more neutral word than ""suppression"" to describe the opposition to the law.
* Use more clear and concise language.

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Source:**

अयोध्या, मथुरा, पंपापुरी, कौशांबी, सारनाथ आदि यसै कारण तीर्थ मानिएको छ र तिनको यात्रा पनि यसै भावनादेखि तीर्थ स्थान मानिएका छन्।

**Machine Translation:**

Ayodhya, mathura, punpuri, kaushanbi, sarnath etc. are considered for this reason, and her journeys have been considered for this reason.

**Reference Translation:**

Ayodhya , Mathura , Pampapuri , Kaushambi , Sarnath etc. are considered as pilgrimages for this reason and his travels are also considered as pilgrimage places from this sentiment .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses more formal language and uses synonyms that are not as close in meaning to the original text. For example, ""तिर्थ मानिएको छ"" is translated as ""are considered for this reason"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses the more precise term ""pilgrimages"" and ""pilgrimage places.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the original text. For example, the sentence ""तिनको यात्रा पनि यसै भावनादेखि तीर्थ स्थान मानिएका छन्"" is translated as ""her journeys have been considered for this reason"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses a more concise structure.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of words in the original text. For example, the sentence ""अयोध्या, मथुरा, पंपापुरी, कौशांबी, सारनाथ आदि यसै कारण तीर्थ मानिएको छ"" is translated as ""Ayodhya, mathura, punpuri, kaushanbi, sarnath etc. are considered for this reason"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation follows the same order of words as the original text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It uses different word choice, sentence structure, and word order to convey the same meaning as the original text.

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is in Nepali and describes the life of Gautam Rishi. It uses the phrase ""प्रसंगजस्तै गौतम ऋषिको जिवनमा अन्य पाटाहरू पनि उत्तिकै रोचक र सुन्न योग्य छन्"" which translates to ""Just like the reference to marriage , there are other similarly exciting and listenable aspects of life of Gautam Rishi.""

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to translate the source text. However, it does not capture the meaning of the original text accurately. The translation is not clear and uses the phrase ""alien context"" which is not relevant to the text.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is in English and captures the meaning of the original text more accurately. It uses the phrase ""Just like the reference to marriage"" to make a comparison to the life of Gautam Rishi and other aspects of life.

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. First, the machine translation does not capture the meaning of the original text accurately. It uses the phrase ""alien context"" which is not relevant to the text. Second, the machine translation does not use the same phrasing as the original text. Third, the machine translation does not use the same tone as the original text.

The reference translation is more similar to the original text in terms of meaning, phrasing, and tone. However, the reference translation does not use the exact same wording as the original text. This is because the reference translator had to use their own words to translate the original text accurately.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a good translation of the original text. The reference translation is a better translation of the original text. However, the reference translation does not capture the exact same wording as the original text.

The machine translation focuses primarily on the party and its leadership, while the reference translation emphasizes the constitution of consultants and the government.
* **Structure:** The source text is structured in a simple sentence, while the machine translation uses a more complex structure with the addition of phrases like ""parliamentary constituency"" and ""under the leadership of the king."" The reference translation maintains a similar structure to the source text.
* **Word choice:** The source text uses specific Nepali words such as ""नेतृत्व"" (leadership), ""परामर्शदात्री"" (consultant), and ""नेपाल प्रजा पार्टी"" (Nepal Praja Party). The machine translation uses more general English words such as ""leadership,"" ""parliamentary constituency,"" and ""Government of Nepal.""

**Machine translation:** This dance makes dancing, singing, and playing too much.

**Reference translation:** This dance makes the dancers , singers and musicians very happy .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Lack of specificity:** The machine translation does not specify the group of people who are made happy by the dance, while the reference translation specifies ""dancers, singers, and musicians.""
* **Overgeneralization:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""too much"" to describe the intensity of the happiness, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""very happy"" to convey a similar meaning with more nuance.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the verb ""make"" and the incorrect placement of the adverb ""too much.""
* **Lack of cultural understanding:** The machine translation does not capture the cultural context of the source text, which is the Nepali language and culture. The reference translation, on the other hand, takes into account the cultural context and translates the source text in a way that is appropriate for the target audience.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""dancing"" instead of ""dancers"" and ""playing"" instead of ""musicians.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is not of high quality. It lacks specificity, overgeneralization, grammatical errors, and a lack of cultural understanding. The reference translation, on the other hand, is of much higher quality. It is more accurate, nuanced, and culturally appropriate.

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** यसकै फलस्वरूप सन् १९३४ को गर्मी याममा उनको ज्यान लिने उद्देश्यले तीन असफल प्रयास भएका थिए ।

**Machine translation:** Soon there were three unsuccessful attempts to take his life in the summer of 1934.

**Reference translation:** As a result , three unsuccessful attempts were made to assassinate him in the summer of 1934 .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It uses fewer words to convey the same meaning.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the word ""take his life"" instead of ""assassinate"" and ""unsuccessful attempts"" instead of ""attempts to assassinate.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. For example, the machine translation puts the phrase ""in the summer of 1934"" at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation puts it in the middle of the sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written, but it has some errors. The conciseness and word choice are good, but the sentence structure and word order are not. The machine translation also uses different words than the reference translation, which can be confusing for some readers. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation**

**Source:** लिक्विडेटर नियुक्तिका निमित्त निवेदन दर्ता भएको सात दिन भित्र विभागका रजिष्ट्रार

**Machine translation:** Registrar of the department within seven days of registration of liquidator appointments

**Reference translation:** Registrar of the Department within seven days of registration of application for appointment of Liquidator

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

**Differences:**

* **Application for appointment of Liquidator:** The reference translation uses the phrase ""application for appointment of Liquidator,"" while the machine translation uses ""liquidator appointments."" This is a semantic error, as the application for appointment is not the same as the appointments of liquidators.
* **Department:** The reference translation uses the phrase ""Department,"" while the machine translation uses ""department."" This is a typo error.
* **Seven days of registration:** The reference translation uses ""seven days of registration"" to specify the time frame, while the machine translation uses ""seven days of registration of liquidator appointments."" This is a phrase error, as the time frame is related to the application for appointment, not the registration of liquidator appointments.
* **Rajaristrar:** The reference translation uses the word ""Rajaristrar,"" which is not a word in English. The machine translation uses the word ""Registrar,"" which is the correct translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is not of high quality. It has several errors in semantics, spelling, and grammar. The translation is also not very clear and concise.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It has a number of errors and is not able to accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The reference translation is a much better translation, as it is more accurate, clear, and concise.

The source text is a Nepali sentence that describes the origin and status of a person named Khadyaat Dhami. The sentence is well-structured and uses clear and concise language.

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation accurately captures the main points of the source text, but it lacks the precision and fluency of the reference translation. The sentence structure is similar to the source text, but the language is more formal and the use of some idioms and phrases is not appropriate.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of language and style. It uses clear and concise language and accurately captures the meaning of the source text. The sentence structure is also similar to the source text.

**Areas Where the Machine Translation is Different from the Reference Translation:**

* **Use of formal language:** The machine translation uses more formal language than the source text and the reference translation.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not use the same level of precision as the reference translation.
* **Inappropriate idioms and phrases:** The machine translation uses some idioms and phrases that are not appropriate for the context of the text.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation does not use the same sentence structure as the source text.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good attempt to translate the source text, but it lacks the precision and fluency of the reference translation.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source text:** जनयुद्धक्रममा पासाङले धेरैपटक आफ्नो मृत्युको खबर आफैँले सुन्नुभएको थियो।

**Machine translation:** During the January uprising, pasang was heard by himself many times during his death.

**Reference translation:** During the People 's War , Pasang had heard the news of his own death many times .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""uprising"" instead of ""People 's War."" This is because the machine translation does not have the context of the source text, which is the People 's War.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the source text. This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the exact meaning of the source text.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the incorrect verb form ""heard"" instead of ""had heard.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The quality of the machine translation is poor. The machine translation is different from the reference translation in many ways, and it does not capture the meaning of the source text. The machine translation is also full of grammatical errors.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a good quality translation. It is different from the reference translation in many ways, and it does not capture the meaning of the source text. The machine translation is also full of grammatical errors.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** यदि उनीहरु मारिन्छन् भने हामीले भोग गर्ने हरेक वस्तु रगतले मुछिएको रक्तरञ्जित हुनेछ।

**Machine translation:** If they are killed, everything that we suffer will be redeemed by blood.

**Reference translation:** If they are killed , every objects we possess will be stained with blood .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""redeem by blood"" to convey the idea of redemption.
* Does not mention the staining of objects with blood.
* Does not use the phrase ""रगतले मुछिएको"" to emphasize the severity of the situation.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""stained with blood"" to convey the idea of contamination.
* Mentions the staining of objects with blood.
* Uses the phrase ""रगतले मुछिएको"" to emphasize the severity of the situation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to understand, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text. The use of the phrase ""redeem by blood"" is a poor translation of the phrase ""रगतले मुछिएको"" and does not convey the same meaning. The machine translation also lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is a more accurate and precise translation of the source text. The use of the phrase ""stained with blood"" is a more appropriate translation of the phrase ""रगतले मुछिएको."" The reference translation also captures the nuances of the source text more effectively.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, precise, and captures the nuances of the source text more effectively.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is a simple sentence in Nepali that states that a person was granted full rights as Prime Minister.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation attempts to capture the meaning of the source text, but it does not use the same phrasing or sentence structure. It also misinterprets the word ""कत्तिक"" as ""royal college of physicians.""

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the source text. It correctly uses the word ""Kattik"" and also maintains the original sentence structure.

**Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:**

* **Phrasing:** The machine translation uses different phrasing than the source text and the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""जस्तै पूर्ण अधिकार प्रदान गरिएको कुरा"" is translated as ""where he was granted full authority as to the prime minister"" in the machine translation, but it is translated as ""that he was conferred with full right just as a Prime Minister"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text. The source text is a simple sentence, but the machine translation breaks the sentence up into two sentences.
* **Interpretation:** The machine translation misinterprets the word ""कत्तिक."" The word ""कत्तिक"" is a Nepali word that means ""Kattik,"" which is a month of the year. The machine translation interprets ""कत्तिक"" as ""royal college of physicians.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the source text and the reference translation. For example, the word ""अध्ययन"" is translated as ""studied"" in the machine translation, but it is translated as ""study"" in the reference translation.

**Overall, the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation.** The reference translation is more accurate, closer to the source text, and uses more appropriate phrasing and sentence structure.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

- The machine translation uses the word ""lepcha"" instead of ""Lepcha"" in the reference translation. This is also a common error, as the translator may not be aware of the different spellings of the same word in different languages.

**2. Sentence structure:**
- The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to a more complex structure in the reference translation. This is because the machine translator may not be able to find the exact way to translate the sentence structure of the source text, and may have to make some changes to the structure in order to make the translation more readable.

**3. Conciseness:**
- The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. This is because the machine translator may not be able to find the exact way to translate the source text in a way that preserves the original conciseness.

**4. Fluency:**
- The machine translation is not as fluent as the reference translation. This is because the machine translator may not be able to find the exact way to translate the source text in a way that makes it sound natural and fluent.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation:**

Overall, the machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does have some errors in word choice, sentence structure, conciseness and fluency. These errors are not necessarily dealbreakers, but they could be improved.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:**
सावित्रा भण्डारीले २०१९ साफ महिला च्याम्पियनसिपको समुहचरण देखि फाइनल खेल सम्मको प्रत्येक खेलमा कम्तीमा एक गोल गर्न सफल भएकि थिइन् ।

**Machine translation:**
Sawyer was able to score at least one goal in each game of the 2019 Saff Women's team to the finale game.

**Reference translation:**
Sabitri Bhandari was able to score at least one goal in every game from the group stage to final game of SAARC Women 's championship held in 2019 .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

* **Use of different pronouns:**
    * The machine translation uses the pronoun ""Sawyer,"" while the reference translation uses the pronoun ""Sabitri Bhandari.""
* **Use of different verb tenses:**
    * The machine translation uses the present tense (""was able to score""), while the reference translation uses the past tense (""was able to score"").
* **Use of different phrasing:**
    * The machine translation uses the phrase ""in each game,"" while the reference translation uses the phrase ""in every game.""
    * The machine translation uses the phrase ""to the finale game,"" while the reference translation uses the phrase ""to the final game.""
* **Lack of specificity:**
    * The machine translation does not specify the championship or the year, while the reference translation does.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks some of the specificity and precision of the reference translation. The use of different pronouns, verb tenses, and phrasing is mostly minor, but it can be distracting for some readers. The lack of specificity is more significant, as it can make it difficult for readers to understand the full context of the text.

**Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is in Nepali and describes the benefits of worshipping the Khayar tree for people born in the Mrigashira constellation.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text but lacks the elegance and precision of the reference translation. It also misinterprets the meaning of the word ""Khaira"" and uses the word ""nobility"" instead of ""constellation.""

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the original text. It correctly uses the word ""Khayar"" and ""Mrigashira"" and also emphasizes the connection between the tree and the constellation.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of elegance and precision:** The machine translation does not capture the nuances and elegance of the original text. It uses simple and direct language that does not convey the same sense of wonder and inspiration as the original text.
* **Misinterpretation of the word ""Khaira"":** The machine translation incorrectly interprets the meaning of the word ""Khaira."" In Nepali, ""Khaira"" means ""noble"" while in the text, it refers to the Khayar tree.
* **Use of inappropriate word:** The machine translation uses the word ""nobility"" instead of ""constellation"" to describe the Mrigashira constellation. This is not accurate and misleading.
* **Lack of cultural understanding:** The machine translation does not understand the cultural significance of worshipping the Khayar tree in Nepal. The text emphasizes the spiritual connection between the tree and the constellation, which is not reflected in the machine translation.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good summary of the source text but lacks the quality and accuracy of the reference translation. It is clear that the machine translation has not been able to fully capture the nuances and cultural context of the original text.

* Includes the phrase ""highest"" after ""earn.""
* Uses the phrase ""survive"" instead of ""place.""
* Includes the phrase ""the area of music.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The omission of the phrase ""highest"" and the replacement of ""survive"" with ""place"" are both significant errors that affect the overall quality of the translation. The lack of the phrase ""the area of music"" also makes the translation incomplete.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good approximation of the source text, but it does not meet the same level of quality as the reference translation. The errors in grammar, syntax, and vocabulary all contribute to the overall low quality of the translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The text is a short sentence describing a historical event in India. It is concise and to the point.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The translation is clear and concise, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""in the partition of India (Harijan)"" is a good translation of the source text, but the phrase ""he wrote about making the partition of India to Pakistan"" is not. The reference translation is more precise and accurate as it specifies the newspaper in which the text was written and the exact date of the event.

**Step 3: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:**

* **Precision:** The reference translation is more precise as it specifies the newspaper and the date of the event. The machine translation does not specify the newspaper or the date of the event.
* **Accuracy:** The reference translation is more accurate as it uses more precise language and avoids the use of colloquialisms. The machine translation uses some colloquialisms, such as ""Harijan"" and ""partition of India.""
* **Style:** The reference translation is more formal and professional. The machine translation is more conversational and informal.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation. The reference translation is more precise, accurate, and professional.

**Machine translation:** At: Hanuman word means wegwan dynasty power.

**Reference translation:** Therefore , the word Hanuman means a fast moving force .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Context:** The source text is not clear about the context in which the word ""Hanuman"" is being used. The reference translation assumes that the word is being used in the context of the Hindu god Hanuman. The machine translation does not have this context.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses the word ""force"" to translate the word ""शक्ति"". The machine translation uses the word ""dynasty"". This is because the word ""शक्ति"" can also be translated as ""force"", but it can also be translated as ""dynasty"".
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a different sentence structure than the source text. The source text is a single sentence, while the reference translation is divided into two sentences. This is because the reference translation needs to be more clear and concise.
* **Word order:** The reference translation changes the order of the words in the source text. This is because the reference translation needs to be more logical and easy to read.

* **Word order:** The order of the words is not the same as the original text.
* **Missing information:** The translation does not include the year of election (2015) or the specific relationship of the witness to the case.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is much closer to the original text in terms of accuracy, clarity, and style. It has the following strengths:

* **Word choice:** The use of appropriate words and synonyms to convey the same meaning as the original text.
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is well-formed and parallel.
* **Word order:** The order of the words is similar to the original text.
* **Missing information:** The translation includes the year of election and the specific relationship of the witness to the case.

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Source:**

शरीर भरी योनी नै योनी भए र उनको पुरुष यौनाङ्ग लुप्त भयो।

**Machine Translation:**

And it came to pass, when Joni was full of body, that Joni was loosed, and his men were loosed.

**Reference Translation:**

His body became full of vagina and his penis disappeared.

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways.

**1. Conciseness:**

* The source text is very concise, using only 3 words to describe the action of ""becoming full of vagina.""
* The machine translation is more verbose, using 5 words to describe the same action (""came to pass, was loosed, and his men were loosed"").

**2. Word choice:**

* The source text uses the word ""yoini"" which is a slang term for vagina.
* The machine translation uses the word ""vagina,"" which is a more formal term.
* The reference translation uses the word ""vagina"" as well.

**3. Sentence structure:**

* The source text uses a simple sentence structure.
* The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure, with the phrase ""and it came to pass"" being added in.
* The reference translation uses a similar sentence structure to the source text.

**4. Cultural sensitivity:**

* The source text is not culturally sensitive, as it uses a slang term for vagina.
* The machine translation is not culturally sensitive, as it also uses the same slang term.
* The reference translation is not culturally sensitive, as it also uses the same slang term.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation, as it differs in conciseness, word choice, sentence structure, and cultural sensitivity. However, the machine translation is still able to convey the meaning of the source text reasonably well.

The source text is in Nepali and describes a religious practice in Nepal called the worship of Bhagwati during the festival of Dasain.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and summarizes the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. It also uses different phrasing and grammar than the source text.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate translation of the source text. It uses similar phrasing and grammar to the source text, and it also captures the nuances of the original text.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Phrasing:** The machine translation uses different phrasing than the source text and the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""त्यसैले दसैंका नौ दिनसम्म भगवतीको विशेष पूजाआजा गरी"" is translated as ""So the special worship of the goddess lasts nine days"" in the machine translation, but it is translated as ""Therefore , it is practice to worship Bhagwati for nine days of Dasain"" in the reference translation.
* **Grammar:** The machine translation uses different grammar than the source text and the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""दसौं दिन प्रसादस्वरूप टीका र जमरा ग्रहण गर्ने चलन छ"" is translated as ""and the tenth day is to receive tithes and jams"" in the machine translation, but it is translated as ""recieve tika and jamara as as offerings on the tenth day"" in the reference translation.
* **Nuances:** The machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original text. For example, the phrase ""त्यसैले दसैंका नौ दिनसम्म भगवतीको विशेष पूजाआजा गरी"" is translated as ""So the special worship of the goddess lasts nine days"" in the machine translation, but it is translated as ""Therefore , it is practice to worship Bhagwati for nine days of Dasain"" in the reference translation. This is because the machine translation does not understand the context of the sentence, and it simply translates the words ""त्यसैले दसैंका नौ दिनसम्म भगवतीको विशेष पूजाआजा गरी"" as a single phrase.

* **Lack of specificity:** The machine translation does not specify the ""them"" to which it refers, while the reference translation specifies ""their influence"" and ""business.""
* **Use of different vocabulary:** The machine translation uses the word ""closure"" and ""influence,"" while the reference translation uses the word ""influence"" and ""business.""
* **Lack of cultural awareness:** The machine translation does not consider the cultural context of Nepal, while the reference translation is aware of the cultural context and uses language that is appropriate for the Nepali audience.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the quality of the machine translation is fair but could be improved. It is able to capture the main idea of the source text, but it lacks specificity, accuracy, and cultural awareness. The use of passive voice and different vocabulary is also not ideal.

**Step 4: Make suggestions for improvement.**

To improve the quality of the machine translation, the following suggestions can be made:

* Use the active voice.
* Specify the ""them"" to which the text refers.
* Use more specific vocabulary.
* Consider the cultural context of Nepal.
* Use more accurate and precise language.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Reading the Source Text**

The source text is a Nepali sentence that states that all bonds are broken due to a betrayal. The sentence is concise and direct, but it uses some idiomatic expressions and cultural references that may not be understood by everyone.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Machine Translation**

The machine translation is a good attempt to translate the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original language. The translation is more literal and does not use the same idiomatic expressions as the source text. The sentence structure is also different, and the overall tone is more formal.

**Step 3: Analyzing the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is a more accurate and faithful translation of the source text. The translator has captured the meaning of the original sentence and used similar phrasing and sentence structure. The translation is also more concise and direct, and it uses a more conversational tone.

**Areas where the Machine Translation is Different from the Reference Translation:**

* **Idioms:** The machine translation does not use the same idiomatic expressions as the source text. For example, the phrase "" मोह आदि संपूर्ण बन्धनहरू"" is not translated correctly.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a different sentence structure than the source text. The source text is a single sentence, while the machine translation is divided into two sentences.
* **Tone:** The machine translation has a more formal tone than the source text. The source text is more conversational, while the machine translation is more formal and literary.
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is not as concise as the source text. The source text is very concise, while the machine translation is more verbose.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good attempt to translate the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original language. The reference translation is a more accurate and faithful translation of the source text.

The text is in Nepali and describes the ELPV's intention to find a way between the Red Flag Party's extremism and the government's capitalist policy.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text but lacks precision and clarity. It also uses different phrasing and sentence structure than the source text.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is closer to the source text in terms of phrasing, sentence structure and meaning. However, it does not use the same word ""extremist"" as the source text. Instead, it uses the term ""left"" which may not be as accurate in this context.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Precision:** The machine translation lacks precision and does not capture all of the details in the source text. For example, the machine translation does not mention the ""Red Flag Party"" or the ""capitalist policy.""

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:**
यस्ता महाकाव्यमा भाषामा, परिवेशमा पात्रचयनमा बारम्बार परिष्कार र परिमार्जन गरिएको हुन्छ ।

**Machine translation:**
In such a plant language, the barrier is introduced and modified in characteristics in the environment.

**Reference translation:**
In such epics , selection of language , environment , character are repeatedly refined and modified .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""plant"" instead of ""epic"" to describe the source text. This is a semantic error, as the source text is not about plants.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""barrier"" to describe the selection of language, while the reference translation uses the word ""character."" This is a different translation of the same concept.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more concise structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex structure.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style, while the reference translation has a more conversational style.
    * The machine translation does not use the same level of formality as the reference translation.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways, including word choice, sentence structure, and style. While the machine translation is able to capture some of the meaning of the source text, it does not do a good job of capturing the nuances of the language or the style of the text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text.**

The source text is in Nepali and describes the actions of Bahadur Singh Baral and his son Khadgajit.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation.**

The machine translation is in English and summarizes the source text. However, it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text in some places.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation.**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate translation of the source text. It captures the meaning of the source text more closely than the machine translation.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""in the same order"" instead of ""meanwhile"" and ""did not necessarily follow that way"" instead of ""did not follow that path.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation, such as the use of the phrase ""also filled in"" in the second sentence.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence, such as ""the son of the Supreme Council"" being moved to the beginning of the second sentence.
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation, which is more verbose.
* **Clarity:** The machine translation is less clear than the reference translation in some places, such as the use of the phrase ""that way"" in the second sentence.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It captures the main points of the source text, but it does not capture the exact meaning in some places. The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text and is more closely aligned with the original meaning.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is in Nepali and describes the act of worshiping the god Indradik with the help of the priest Bhrihaspati.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to translate the source text. However, it does not capture the nuances of the original text and has several errors.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate translation of the source text. It captures the meaning of the original text more closely and uses more precise language.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation lacks precision and does not use specific terms or phrases that are used in the original text. For example, the phrase ""Indradik gods"" is not precise and does not specify which gods are included.
* **Misinterpretation:** The machine translation misinterprets the original text and does not understand the context in which the worship is taking place. For example, the phrase ""by wedding"" is not appropriate in this context and should be replaced with ""began to worship.""
* **Use of incorrect grammar:** The machine translation uses incorrect grammar and syntax. For example, the phrase ""went near to the Lord"" is grammatically incorrect and should be corrected to ""approached the Lord.""
* **Lack of cultural understanding:** The machine translation does not have a good understanding of Nepali culture and customs. For example, the concept of ""Vedmantra"" is not explained in the machine translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text and has many errors. The reference translation is a more accurate and closer translation of the original text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Source:**

नेवारहरूमा चोख्याउने काम साधारणतया शिशु जन्मेको चौंथो वा छैंठो दिनमा गरिन्छ तथापि विशेष अवस्था परेमा भोलिपल्ट पनि चोख्याइन्छ।

**Machine Translation:**

The act of stealing in nearbies is generally done on the fourth or sixth day of the shishu birthday, although special conditions are also stolen on the morning.

**Reference Translation:**

In Newar , cleansing is usually done on the fourth or sixth day after the baby is born , but in special cases , cleansing is done the next day .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""steal"" instead of ""cleansing"" which is more accurate in the context of the text.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise and easier to read.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence to make it more grammatically correct.
* **Use of colloquialisms:** The machine translation does not use any colloquialisms that are used in the source text.
* **Cultural references:** The machine translation does not include any cultural references that are made in the source text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not capture all of the nuances of the original text. The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text, but it is also more verbose and difficult to read.

**Recommendations:**

The best translation of the source text would be a hybrid of the machine translation and the reference translation. This would combine the accuracy of the reference translation with the conciseness and readability of the machine translation.

**Reference Translation:**
But people of the recently spread Pranami community have been worshiping their own religious gurus , including Lord Krishna and Mangaldasji Maharaj .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Use of terminology:**
- The source text uses the term ""प्रणामी धर्म सम्प्रदाय"" which is not present in the reference translation. This term is specific to the Nepali context and may not be understood by English speakers.
- The machine translation uses the term ""systematic patriarchs"" which is not very accurate. The term ""systematic patriarchs"" is not synonymous with ""religious gurus"".

**2. Use of gender:**
- The source text uses the gender neutral pronoun ""मानिसहरू"" which is not present in the reference translation. The reference translation uses the gender specific pronoun ""people"" which is more appropriate in this context.

**3. Use of conjunctions:**
- The source text uses the conjunction ""ले"" which is not present in the reference translation. The reference translation uses the conjunction ""but"" which is more appropriate in this context.

**Reference translation:** In the temple of the goddess , a dozens of bananas must be offered .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the term ""temple of the goddess"" instead of ""temple of the goddess"" in the source text.
* Uses the term ""number of keras"" instead of ""dozens of bananas"" in the source text.
* Does not include the phrase ""must be offered"" in the same order as the source text.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the same phrase ""temple of the goddess"" as the source text.
* Uses the same phrase ""dozens of bananas"" as the source text.
* Includes the phrase ""must be offered"" in the same order as the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

**Source:** त्यति पटक क्षेत्रीहरूको विनास गर्ने परशुरामले आफ्नी मातालाई बचन दिए ।

**Meaning:** Parashuram promised his mother to destroy the Chhetris as many times as he could.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

**Machine translation:** And it came to pass at the same time, that the tradition of destruction of the regions was delivered unto his mother.

**Step 3: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:**

**Differences:**

* **Conciseness:** The reference translation is more concise than the machine translation. The reference translation uses fewer words to convey the same meaning as the machine translation.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses more precise and formal language than the machine translation. For example, the reference translation uses the word ""Chhetris"" to describe the group of people that Parashuram promised to destroy, while the machine translation uses the word ""regions.""
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation. The reference translation uses a compound sentence to describe the relationship between Parashuram's promise and the destruction of the Chhetris, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure.
* **Cultural context:** The reference translation is more aware of the cultural context of the story. The reference translation assumes that the reader is familiar with the story of Parashuram and the Chhetris, and therefore does not need to explain the background of the conflict. The machine translation is less aware of the cultural context of the story, and therefore may not be as clear to the reader.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not as accurate or well-written as the reference translation. The machine translation is more concise and uses simpler language than the reference translation, but it also loses some of the precision and formality of the reference translation. The machine translation is also less aware of the cultural context of the story than the reference translation.

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source text:** शतरुद्र संहितामा हनुमानलाई एकादश रुद्रमध्ये एघारौँ रूप हनुमानको मानिएको छ।

**Machine translation:** In Satrudra, Hanuman is considered the eleventh of the akkadian rudras.

**Reference translation:** In the Shatrudra Samhita , Hanuman is considered to be the eleventh incarnation among ekadash rudra .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Context:** The source text is in Nepali, while the machine translation and reference translation are in English. The source text is specifically about the Shatrudra Samhita and Hanuman's position as the eleventh Rudra. The machine translation does not provide any context about the Shatrudra Samhita or Hanuman's position as the Rudra. The reference translation provides some context about the Shatrudra Samhita and Hanuman's position as the Rudra, but not as much as the source text.
* **Word choice:** The source text uses the word ""शतरुद्र"" (Shatrudra) and ""हनुमान"" (Hanuman). The machine translation uses the word ""akkadian"" instead of ""Shatrudra."" The reference translation uses the word ""Shatrudra"" but not ""Hanuman.""
* **Sentence structure:** The source text has a complex sentence structure. The machine translation has a simpler sentence structure. The reference translation has a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation, but not as complex as the source text.
* **Translation:** The machine translation is not a very accurate translation of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation, but it does not capture all of the nuances of the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a very good translation of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation, but it does not capture all of the nuances of the source text.

## Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is a simple sentence in Nepali that states the idea that something was made by humans and can be minimized by understanding it. It uses the word ""मान्छेले"" (made by human) and ""न्युनिकरण गर्न"" (can be minimized) to emphasize the human element.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the same level of precision and accuracy. It uses the phrase ""man made"" to convey the idea of human creation, but it does not use the phrase ""can be minimized"" to emphasize the human ability to understand and reduce the problem.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is more faithful to the source text than the machine translation. It uses the same phrase ""made by human"" and ""can be minimized"" to convey the same ideas as the source text. It also preserves the same sentence structure and word choice.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the ""thing"" that was made by human, while the reference translation does.
* **Lack of accuracy:** The machine translation does not use the same phrase ""can be minimized"" as the source text, which is a key difference in meaning.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the phrase ""by understanding it"" instead of ""by understanding it can be minimized.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the source text, such as ""man made"" instead of ""मान्छेले"" and ""can be minimized"" instead of ""न्युनिकरण गर्न.""

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the same level of precision, accuracy, and fidelity to the source text as the reference translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text and preserves the same meaning and structure.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:**
यस्तो विवरण सुनेर क्रोधित भई कुबेरले उसलाई स्त्रीवियोग र मृत्युलोकमा जन्म लिई कोढरोगग्रस्त हुने श्राप दिए।

**Machine translation:**
And it came to pass, when he heard the wrath, that he cursed the woman, and the woman's birth, and the woman's death.

**Reference translation:**
Kuber got angry with such a description and cursed him to be separated from his wife and born on earth suffering leprosy .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. The source text is quite verbose, while the machine translation is more streamlined.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the word ""curse"" instead of ""cursed,"" and the machine translation uses the word ""birth"" instead of ""separation.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The source text is written in a complex sentence structure, while the machine translation is written in a simpler sentence structure.
* **Interpretation:** The machine translation does not interpret the source text as well as the reference translation. The source text is about a curse, while the machine translation is about a woman's death.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is concise, but it lacks accuracy and clarity. The word choice is poor, and the sentence structure is not well-structured. The interpretation is also poor.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It is too concise, inaccurate, and unclear. The reference translation is a much better translation of the source text. It is more accurate, clear, and well-structured.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** सत्र वर्षमा विवाह भएकी महिला ३५ वर्षको युवा उमेरमा हजुरआमा बन्न सक्छिन् ।

**Machine translation:** Women who were married in seventeen years could become injured at a young age of 35.

**Reference translation:** A woman who gets married at the age of seventeen can become a grandmother at a young age of 35 .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""could become injured"" instead of ""can become a grandmother.""
* Does not mention the age of the woman when she gets married.
* Does not specify the relationship between the woman and the child.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""can become a grandmother"" to emphasize the possibility of becoming a grandmother.
* Mentions the age of the woman when she gets married (seventeen).
* Specifies the relationship between the woman and the child (mother).

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text. The use of the phrase ""could become injured"" is not appropriate in this context, as it does not convey the same meaning as ""can become a grandmother."" The lack of information about the woman's age and relationship to the child also makes the translation incomplete.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text. It uses the correct phrase ""can become a grandmother"" and mentions the woman's age and relationship to the child. However, the use of some colloquial language, such as ""seventeen years"" and ""young age,"" may not be appropriate for some readers.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text, but it may not be appropriate for all readers.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence. This is also a minor error, but it does affect the flow of the text.
* **Style:** The machine translation does not capture the style of the source text. The source text is written in a formal and academic style, while the machine translation is written in a more conversational style.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is well-written, but it does have some errors. The errors are not major, but they do affect the flow of the text and the overall quality of the translation.

**Step 4: Make recommendations for improvement.**

The machine translation could be improved by:

* Using more accurate word choice.
* Maintaining the original sentence structure.
* Keeping the original word order.
* Capturing the style of the source text.

**Source text:**
 महाकाव्य समसामयिक विधाका रूपमा पनि रहेको हुनाले यसलाई वर्तमानको सापेक्षतामा पनि परिभाषित गर्नु जरुरी हुन्छ ।

**Machine translation:**
Because the majority is also as a major controversial genre, it needs to be defined as a relative of the current.

**Reference translation:**
Since the epic is also a contemporary genre , it is important to define it in relativity of the present .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""major controversial genre"" to describe the epic genre.
* States that the epic genre needs to be defined as a relative of the current.
* Does not explain why the epic genre is considered controversial.
* Does not provide any evidence to support this statement.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""contemporary genre"" to describe the epic genre.
* Explains why the epic genre is considered contemporary.
* Provides evidence to support this statement.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text.

- The machine translation uses the word ""rectangles"" instead of ""volume"". This is a semantic error, as the source text uses the word ""मात्र"" which specifically means ""volume"".
- The machine translation uses the word ""airflow"" instead of "" airflow"" in the second sentence. This is a translation error, as the source text does not mention airflow.

**2. Sentence structure:**
- The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise. This is a stylistic change, which may not be appropriate in this context.

**3. Conciseness:**
- The machine translation is more concise than the source text and the reference translation. This is due to the removal of unnecessary words and phrases.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation:**

The machine translation is able to capture the meaning of the source text, but it has some errors in word choice and sentence structure.

**Reference translation:**

On the other hand , the students studying at Tri-chandra College also joined the democratic movement by establishing the Nepal Student Union .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""shadows"" instead of ""students"" in the source text. This is because the machine translator may have found the word ""students"" to be too generic, and ""shadows"" is a more specific term that is more closely related to the context of the text.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the source text. The source text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure. This is because the machine translator may have found that the compound sentence was too complex for the machine to translate accurately.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of some words in the source text. This is because the machine translator may have found that the original order of the words was not the best for English grammar.
* **Syntax:** The machine translation does not use the same syntax as the source text. The source text uses a more formal syntax, while the machine translation uses a more conversational syntax. This is because the machine translator may have found that the formal syntax was too difficult for the machine to translate accurately.

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation, removing the phrase ""अनेक लडाइ तथा युद्धहरू"" and condensing the sentence into a single clause.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""battles"" instead of ""wars"" and ""surviving"" instead of ""surviving.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a different sentence structure than the reference translation, using a simple past tense instead of the compound past tense.
* **Word order:** The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation, with the phrase ""in the name of the kingdom"" being moved to the end of the sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. While it is generally accurate, it is less concise and uses different words and sentence structure. The word choice and sentence structure are particularly noticeable, as they do not match the style of the original text. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** टोलीको कप्तानको रुपमा उनले पोर्चुगलको पहिलो अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय उपाधिको कप उचाले।

**Machine translation:** As captain of toys, he produced Portugal's first international professional cup.

**Reference translation:** He lifted Portugal 's first international title cup as captain of the team .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""as captain of toys"" instead of ""as captain of the team.""
- Uses the phrase ""produced"" instead of ""lifted.""
- Does not include the phrase ""title cup.""
- Does not specify the international nature of the cup.

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""as captain of the team"" to clarify the relationship between the captain and the team.
- Uses the phrase ""lifted"" to emphasize the action of raising the cup.
- Includes the phrase ""title cup"" to specify the type of cup.
- Specifies the international nature of the cup by mentioning ""Portugal 's.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to understand, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The phrase ""as captain of toys"" is not a suitable translation for ""as captain of the team."" The phrase ""produced"" is not a precise synonym for ""lifted."" The omission of the phrase ""title cup"" and the lack of specificity about the international nature of the cup are also significant issues.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original text. It uses clear and concise language, and it captures the meaning of the original text in a precise and nuanced way. The phrase ""as captain of the team"" is a precise translation of ""as captain of toys."" The use of the phrase ""lifted"" is an appropriate synonym for ""produced."" The inclusion of the phrase ""title cup"" and the specification of the international nature of the cup are also important elements of the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. It is more accurate, faithful to the original text, and uses more precise language. The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to understand, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text and lacks precision in its language.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is a simple sentence describing Ratan Singh's three sons and their respective titles. It uses basic grammar and vocabulary.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation accurately captures the main points of the source text, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation. The sentence structure is similar to the source text, but the word choice and phrasing are not always the best.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is well-written and accurate. It uses clear and concise language, and the sentence structure is well-crafted. It also captures the nuances of the source text, such as the use of the term ""successors"" and the specific titles of the sons.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses some less precise words than the reference translation, such as ""bomb"" instead of ""son"" and ""moonvan"" instead of ""Chandrabhan.""
* **Phrasing:** The machine translation does not always use the best phrasing, which can make the sentence sound awkward or unnatural.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation follows the same sentence structure as the source text, but it does not use the same word order as the reference translation.
* **Nuances:** The machine translation does not capture some of the nuances of the source text, such as the use of the term ""successors"" and the specific titles of the sons.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good attempt to translate the source text, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**
* The phrase ""रचना गरेको धनुष चन्द्रोदय"" is translated as ""There are 60 thousand verses in the book called Dhanush Chandrodaya.""
* The phrase ""हजार श्लोक छन्"" is translated as ""there are 60 thousand verses.""
* The phrase ""Dhanush Chandrodaya"" is used instead of ""bow chandroshan.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the precision and elegance of the reference translation. The phrase ""रचना गरेको धनुष चन्द्रोदय"" is not translated, which is a major deficiency. The phrase ""बow chandroshan"" is also a poor translation, as it does not capture the meaning of the original phrase ""Dhanush Chandrodaya.""

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point, but it could be improved. The main areas where the translation could be improved are the translation of the phrase ""रचना गरेको धनुष चन्द्रोदय"" and the phrase ""बow chandroshan.""

**Machine translation:** The marriage of the sixth shivaji maharaj was held in lalmah with siwai following on 14 May 1640.

**Reference translation:** Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was married to Saiwai Nimbaler on 14 May 1640 at Lalmahal .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Order of information:** The machine translation follows a different order of information than the reference translation. The source text begins with the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's marriage, while the machine translation begins with the date and location of the marriage.
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. The source text is more verbose, while the machine translation is more to the point.

## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:**
नेपाल अधिराज्यको संविधान २०४७मा राजकीय सत्ता तथा राजाको अधिकारको विषयमा केही व्यवस्थाहरू स्पष्ट नभएकाले राजाले यो कदम उठाउन सकेका थिए।

**Machine Translation:**
The Constitution of Nepal was introduced in 2047, as some laws concerning the royal seventh and king's rights were not explicitly adopted by the king because the king could raise this step.

**Reference Translation:**
The King was able to take this step as some of the provisions in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 2047 regarding the state power and the rights of the king were not clear .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Lack of clarity:**
- The machine translation states ""some laws concerning the royal seventh and king's rights were not explicitly adopted"" without explaining the nature of the laws or the specific issues with their clarity.
- The reference translation clarifies the issue by stating ""some of the provisions in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 2047 regarding the state power and the rights of the king were not clear.""

**2. Misinterpretation:**
- The machine translation incorrectly states ""the king could raise this step"" to mean the king could implement this step.
- The reference translation clarifies the meaning of ""raise this step"" as ""take this step.""

**3. Lack of precision:**
- The machine translation does not specify the nature of the ""laws concerning the royal seventh and king's rights.""
- The reference translation specifies ""some of the provisions"" and mentions ""state power and the rights of the king.""

**Step 3: Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation due to lack of clarity, misinterpretation and lack of precision. While the machine translation conveys the general idea of the source text, it does not provide enough details or explanations to make it fully understandable. The reference translation is more accurate and clear in its translation, as it not only captures the meaning of the source text but also provides additional details and explanations to enhance understanding.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation:**

**Source:** अन्नमा ९ प्रतिशत वा त्यसभन्दा कम ओस भयो भने चर्बीको गन्ध आउँदैन।

**Machine translation:** If the corn is 9 percent or less, the smell of the spark is not coming.

**Reference translation:** If the grain has moisture content of 9 percent or less , it does not smell of fat .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Word choice:**
- The machine translation uses the word ""spark"" instead of ""grain"" in the second sentence. This is not a suitable substitution as the word ""spark"" does not have the same meaning as ""grain"" in this context.
- The machine translation uses the word ""coming"" instead of ""not coming"" in the second sentence. This is also not a suitable substitution as the word ""coming"" is not the best choice in this context.

**2. Sentence structure:**
- The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text in the second sentence. The source text has a more complex sentence structure with a dependent clause, while the machine translation simplifies the sentence structure. This changes the flow and rhythm of the sentence.

**3. Conciseness:**
- The machine translation is more concise than the source text and the reference translation. This is because the machine translation does not include some of the unnecessary details that are in the source text.

**4. Accuracy:**
- The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. This is because the machine translation does not translate the source text perfectly and some of the meaning is lost in translation.

**Step 3: Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not of good quality. It has many differences from the reference translation, including word choice, sentence structure, conciseness and accuracy. These differences make the machine translation difficult to read and understand.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:**
सन् १९८८मा मेजर पदमा बढुवा भएपछि एक उच्च पदमा रहेका जनरल रोड्रिगेज ओचोआले चाभेजलाई मन पराउन थाले र काराकसमा आफ्नो सहयोगीको रूपमा नियुक्त गरे ।

**Machine translation:**
After growing up in a major post in 1988, a highly regarded junior Rodrigues Ochoa began to favor chávez and was appointed as his assistant at caracus.

**Reference translation:**
After being promoted to position of major in 1988 , General Rodrigej Ochao who is in higher position started liking Chavez and was appointed as his assitant at Carcus .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""growing up"" instead of ""being promoted"" in the first sentence.
* Omits the phrase ""who is in higher position"" in the second sentence.
* Uses the phrase ""favor chávez"" instead of ""started liking Chavez"" in the second sentence.
* Uses the phrase ""assistant at caracus"" instead of ""assitant at Carcus"" in the second sentence.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""being promoted"" instead of ""growing up"" in the first sentence.
* Includes the phrase ""who is in higher position"" in the second sentence.
* Uses the phrase ""started liking Chavez"" instead of ""favor chávez"" in the second sentence.
* Uses the phrase ""assitant at Carcus"" instead of ""assistant at caracus"" in the second sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some differences from the reference translation. These differences are primarily due to the use of different phrasing and the omission of some phrases. The machine translation is still able to convey the meaning of the source text, but it does not read as smoothly or as accurately as the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does have some differences from the reference translation. These differences are primarily due to the use of different phrasing and the omission of some phrases. The machine translation is still able to convey the meaning of the source text, but it does not read as smoothly or as accurately as the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** डाँडी गीतमा वाक्क दिक्क भएर बसेकाहरू झुमरी गीतको नाच आरम्भ गर्ने बित्तिकै फेरी तरङ्गित हुन थाल्छन् ।

**Machine translation:** The waking in the mountain song is waved again as they initiate the dance of the bhumari song.

**Reference translation:** Those fed up with Dandi song get excited immediately after beginning of dance of Jhumari song .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Conciseness:** The reference translation is more concise than the machine translation. The reference translation uses fewer words to convey the same meaning as the machine translation.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses more precise and idiomatic words than the machine translation. For example, the reference translation uses the word ""get excited"" instead of the machine translation's ""waved.""
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation. The reference translation uses a compound sentence to convey the same meaning as the machine translation's two sentences.
* **Cultural references:** The reference translation includes a cultural reference to the Dandi song, while the machine translation does not.
* **Register:** The reference translation is written in a more formal register than the machine translation. The reference translation uses more formal language and avoids using colloquialisms.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is not of high quality. The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways, including conciseness, word choice, sentence structure, cultural references, and register. The machine translation is also not very clear and concise. It is difficult to understand what the machine translation is saying.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Nepali-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text:**

The source text is a short sentence describing a scene in a song video. It uses some colloquial language and references a specific flag.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some issues. It correctly identifies the scene and mentions the flag of Ukraine, but it uses the phrase ""giant Ukraine's flagship"" which is not a precise translation of the original text. The phrase ""if she comes across"" is also not a perfect translation, as it does not convey the same sense of possibility as the original text.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation. It correctly uses the phrase ""scenes from the video"" and ""flag of Ukraine"" and also conveys the same sense of possibility as the original text.

**Analysis of differences:**

* **Machine translation:**
    * Uses the phrase ""giant Ukraine's flagship"" which is not a precise translation of the original text.
    * Uses the phrase ""if she comes across"" which does not convey the same sense of possibility as the original text.
    * Does not mention the dress of the singer.
* **Reference translation:**
    * Uses the phrase ""scenes from the video"" which is a more accurate translation of the original text.
    * Uses the phrase ""flag of Ukraine"" which is a precise translation of the original text.
    * Conveys the same sense of possibility as the original text.
    * Mentions the dress of the singer.

**Overall:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. It is more accurate, conveys the same sense of possibility, and also mentions additional details that are not included in the machine translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:**
B बज्रांग र बाझांग एकै भए जस्तै ताराकसुर र खपरे/दाड़ेमष्ट एकै हुन् ।

**Machine translation:**
Bajrang and bajhang are the same as starakshur and dhupre / Dadhimast.

**Reference translation:**
As Bajrang and Bajhang are the same , Taraksur and Khapare / Dademasht are the same .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Conciseness:** The reference translation is more concise than the machine translation. The reference translation uses fewer words to convey the same meaning as the source text.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses more precise and formal language than the machine translation. For example, the reference translation uses the word ""same"" instead of ""the same"" and ""Taraksur"" instead of ""starakshur.""
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation follows a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation. The reference translation uses a compound sentence to combine the two sentences in the source text.
* **Word order:** The reference translation changes the order of the words in the source text. The reference translation moves the modifier ""as"" to the beginning of the sentence.
* **Translation of idioms:** The reference translation translates the idiom ""जस्तै ताराकसुर र खपरे/दाड़ेमष्ट एकै हुन्"" literally, while the machine translation translates the idiom as ""are the same.""

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways, including conciseness, word choice, sentence structure, word order, and the translation of idioms. These differences are due to the fact that the machine translation is not able to fully capture the nuances of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model
