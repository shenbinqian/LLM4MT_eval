A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a complex sentence with a few challenging elements, such as the use of modal verbs and the phrase ""soovida"" (which is not directly translatable).

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the original phrasing and style. The translation is also slightly more verbose than the source text.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the original text than the machine translation. It preserves the original phrasing and style, and it also uses more precise terminology.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Phrasing:** The machine translation does not use the same phrasing as the source text or the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""soovida, õieti ei tohi soovida"" is not translated directly into English. Instead, the machine translation uses the phrase ""may not be wanted"" which is not as precise.
* **Style:** The machine translation is more verbose than the source text and the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is trying to translate the entire sentence into a single English sentence, which is not always possible.
* **Terminology:** The machine translation does not use the same terminology as the source text or the reference translation. For example, the word ""soovija"" is not translated directly into English. Instead, the machine translation uses the word ""wish-maker"" which is not as precise.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good attempt to translate the source text into English, but it does not preserve the original phrasing, style, or terminology. The reference translation is a more accurate and closer translation to the source text.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Tulebotsustada, kui suur erinevus on selle vahel, mida ta tegi, ja tegude vahel, mis näitavad meile mõrva tõsidust.

**Machine translation:** It is important to decide what a difference there is between what he has done and the actions that show us the gravity of the murder.

**Reference translation:** It is important to decide how big a difference there is between what he has done and the actions that show us the gravity of the murder .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It uses fewer words to convey the same meaning.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, ""erinevus"" is translated as ""difference"" and ""tõsidust"" is translated as ""gravity.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a complex sentence structure with a comparative clause. The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a comparative phrase.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""mis näitavad meile mõrva tõsidust"" is translated as ""the actions that show us the gravity of the murder.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand. However, it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The conciseness and simplicity of the machine translation make it difficult to understand the nuances of the source text. The different word choice and sentence structure also make it difficult to understand the source text. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it does not match the quality of the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Vesi on suhteliselt puhas, kuigi mõnda kohta koguneb muda.

**Machine translation:** Water is relatively clean, even though some places are gathering sludge.

**Reference translation:** Water is relatively clean , even though sludge gathers in some places .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""gathering"" instead of ""collects"" in the reference translation. ""Gathering"" is not as precise as ""collects"" and does not convey the same sense of directionality.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""clean"" instead of ""relatively clean"" in the reference translation. ""Clean"" is a more absolute term, while ""relatively clean"" is more nuanced and conveys the idea that the water is mostly clean but not perfect.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise and easier to read.
    * The machine translation moves the modifier ""even though"" to the beginning of the sentence, which is not the same as the original text.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words ""some places"" to the end of the sentence, which is not the same as the original text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text well. However, there are some differences in word choice, sentence structure and word order that make the translation less than perfect. The use of more precise words and the more nuanced phrasing of the reference translation would improve the quality of the machine translation.

**Reference translation:**
The General Affairs Council has made the final preparations to forward the draft EU budget to the European Council meeting .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Verb ""tegi"" vs. ""forward"":** The machine translation uses the verb ""direct"" instead of ""forward"" in the reference translation. This is a semantic error, as ""direct"" is not synonymous with ""forward.""
* **Missing preposition ""to"":** The machine translation does not include the preposition ""to"" after ""forward.""
* **Lack of formality:** The machine translation is more informal than the reference translation, using the second person singular (""you"") instead of the third person singular (""they"") and omitting the formal ""meeting"" phrase.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""draft"" instead of ""proposal"" and ""council"" instead of ""Council.""
* **Syntax:** The machine translation has a different sentence structure than the reference translation, using a more concise and direct style.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is not of high quality. It has several errors in grammar, semantics, and style. The use of incorrect verbs, missing prepositions, and the lack of formality make the translation difficult to understand and unnatural.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Mileetose koolkonna filosoofide järgi pärinevad kõik asjad ühest ürgalgest.

**Machine translation:** According to the philosophers in Mileetos School, all the things come from one spinary.

**Reference translation:** According to the philosophers of the Milesian school , all things come from one primordial origin .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Spinary:** The word ""spinary"" is not present in the original text and is a mistranslation of the word ""ursprung"".
* **School:** The word ""school"" is not the best translation of the word ""koolkonna"" as it does not have the same meaning in this context.
* **Origin:** The word ""primordial origin"" is a more precise translation of the word ""ursprung"" than ""one primordial origin"".

**Reference translation:**

* **School:** The word ""school"" is a more accurate translation of the word ""koolkonna"" in this context.
* **Origin:** The word ""primordial origin"" is a more precise translation of the word ""ursprung"".

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some errors in the translation of certain words and phrases. The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the original text.

**Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved.**

**Machine translation:** From the complex theories that the philosophy must develop, simple and obvious facts must be returned.

**Reference translation:** From the complex theories that philosophy must develop , we must return to simple and obvious facts .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Omission:** The phrase ""keeruliste teooriate juurest"" is omitted.
* **Rewording:** The phrase ""tuleb naasta lihtsate ja ilmsete tõsiasjade juurde"" is reworded to ""simple and obvious facts must be returned.""
* **Word choice:** The word ""theories"" is used instead of ""complex theories.""
* **Syntax:** The sentence structure is different.

**Reference translation:**

* **Paraphrasing:** The phrase ""keeruliste teooriate juurest"" is paraphrased to ""From the complex theories.""
* **Word choice:** The word ""we"" is used instead of ""from"" to create a more formal tone.
* **Syntax:** The sentence structure is different.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the translation.**

**Machine translation:**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it lacks the elegance and precision of the reference translation. The omission of the phrase ""keeruliste teooriate juurest"" is a major problem, as it is an important part of the source text. The rewording of the phrase ""tuleb naasta lihtsate ja ilmsete tõsiasjade juurde"" is also a problem, as it does not capture the same meaning as the original text.

**Reference translation:**

The reference translation is a more accurate and elegant translation of the source text. The paraphrasing of the phrase ""keeruliste teooriate juurest"" is well-done, and the use of the word ""we"" instead of ""from"" creates a more formal tone.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is the better translation of the source text. It is more accurate, elegant and precise.

**Machine translation:** Although Darwin had the last 22 years of life in the hands of periodic disease care, this did not prevent him from continuing his work.

**Reference translation:** Although Darwin suffered from periodic diseases for the last 22 years of his life , this did not prevent him from continuing his work .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Viimased 22 aastat oma elust"" is translated as ""the last 22 years of life"" which is not an exact translation. The original text uses the phrase ""Viimased 22 aastat oma elust"" which is a more specific phrase that means ""the last 22 years of life in which one is suffering from a disease.""
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is different in the machine translation compared to the original text and the reference translation. The original text has a more complex sentence structure with a subordinate clause. The machine translation simplifies the sentence structure and loses some of the original meaning.
* **Word order:** The word order is different in the machine translation compared to the original text and the reference translation.

**Reference translation:** The deported generally experienced terrible living conditions .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""terrible"" to describe the living conditions, while the reference translation uses the word ""terrible"" in a more formal tone.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""they"" to refer to the deported, while the reference translation uses the word ""the deported"" to be more specific.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure.
    * The machine translation does not use any conjunctions to connect the sentences, while the reference translation uses conjunctions to connect the sentences.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation follows the order of subject, verb, object, modifier.
    * The reference translation follows the order of subject, modifier, verb, object.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

**Step 1: Reading the source, machine translation and reference translation**

**Source:** Üks omapärasemaid Minose kultuuri arhitektuuri sümboleid on selle ainulaadsed sambad.

**Machine translation:** One of the most original symbols of the architectural architecture of Minos is its unique pillars.

**Reference translation:** One of the most original symbols of the architecture of the Minoan culture is its unique pillars.

**Step 2: Identifying differences between machine translation and reference translation**

**Machine translation:**

* **Lack of cultural reference:** The machine translation does not mention the Minoan culture, which is important for understanding the context of the source text.
* **Inaccurate use of terminology:** The machine translation uses the term ""architectural architecture"" instead of ""Minoan architecture.""
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the word ""symbols.""
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify what makes the pillars unique.

**Reference translation:**

* **Cultural reference:** The reference translation mentions the Minoan culture, which is important for understanding the context of the source text.
* **Accurate use of terminology:** The reference translation uses the term ""Minoan architecture"" correctly.
* **Grammatical accuracy:** The reference translation has no grammatical errors.
* **Precision:** The reference translation is more precise and specifies what makes the pillars unique.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, precise, and culturally sensitive. It also has better grammar and syntax.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation**

**Source:** Ta palkas Montréali ajakirjaniku Michael Woloschuki, saamaks selgust isa elukäigus.

**Machine translation:** He asked the Montréal journalist Michael Woloschuk to get clarity in his life.

**Reference translation:** He hired a Montréal journalist Michael Woloschuk to get clarity about his father 's life .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""asked"" instead of ""hired.""
    * The reference translation uses the word ""father's"" to clarify the relationship between Michael and his father.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation.
    * The reference translation uses a more formal tone and uses the phrase ""about his father's life"" to provide more context.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words ""Montréal"" and ""journalist.""
    * The reference translation follows a more logical order of words.
* **Grammatical errors:**
    * The machine translation has a grammatical error in the phrase ""saamaks selgust isa elukäigus.""
    * The reference translation is grammatically correct.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Normaalteadus üldiselt hoiab filosoofiast eemale, ja küllap õigusega.

**Machine translation:** Normal science in general is keeping the philosophy away, and rightly so.

**Reference translation:** Normal science in general is keeping a distance from philosophy , and probably rightly so .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* The phrase ""hoiab filosoofiast eemale"" is translated as ""keeping the philosophy away."" This phrase is a bit more direct and forceful than the phrase ""keeping a distance from philosophy"" in the reference translation.
* The phrase ""õigusega"" is translated as ""rightly so."" This phrase is a bit more emphatic than the phrase ""probably rightly so"" in the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**
* The phrase ""hoiab filosoofiast eemale"" is translated as ""keeping a distance from philosophy."" This phrase is more nuanced and less direct than the phrase ""keeping the philosophy away"" in the machine translation.
* The phrase ""õigusega"" is translated as ""probably rightly so."" This phrase is more cautious and less emphatic than the phrase ""rightly so"" in the machine translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and captures the meaning of the source text accurately. However, the phrase ""hoiab filosoofiast eemale"" is a bit too direct and the phrase ""õigusega"" is a bit too emphatic. These phrases could be improved in the machine translation.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is well-written and captures the meaning of the source text accurately. However, the phrase ""hoiab filosoofiast eemale"" is a bit too nuanced and the phrase ""õigusega"" is a bit too cautious. These phrases could be improved in the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation and reference translation are both well-written and capture the meaning of the source text accurately. However, there are some minor differences between the two translations. The machine translation is more direct and emphatic, while the reference translation is more nuanced and cautious.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

Ülu küsib Annemailt luba Uuevarikul kliente vastu võtta.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

One day, she will be asked to allow her to receive customers in the New Year.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

Ülu asks Annemai for a permission to receive customers at Uuevariku .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""one day"" instead of the more precise ""ülu"" in the source text.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""allow"" instead of the more formal ""permission"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""New Year"" instead of the more specific ""Uuevariku"" in the source text.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise and easier to read.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""in the New Year"" to the end of the sentence.
    * The machine translation uses a different verb tense than the source text (""will be asked"") to match the tense of the verb ""receive"" in the reference translation.
* **Overall meaning:**
    * The machine translation captures the overall meaning of the source text, but it does not preserve the exactness and precision of the original language.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good approximation of the source text, but it does not match the quality of the reference translation. The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are in the word choice, sentence structure, and overall meaning.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Ludwig Wittgensteini järgijad kalduvad uskuma, et inimeste õppimine nii käibki.

**Machine translation:** Ludwig Wittgenstein's followers tend to believe that this is the way people learn.

**Reference translation:** Ludwig Wittgenstein 's followers tend to believe that this is the way people learn .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""tend"" instead of ""tend to"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""this"" instead of ""that"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure from the source to a more concise structure.
    * The machine translation moves the modifier ""that this is the way people learn"" to the end of the sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""Ludwig Wittgenstein 's followers"" to the beginning of the sentence.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style than the reference translation.
    * The machine translation does not use the same conversational tone as the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The word choice and sentence structure are different from the reference translation, and the style is more formal. The machine translation is also missing some of the nuances of the source text, such as the use of the phrase ""käibki"" and the reference to Wittgenstein.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it is not as accurate or nuanced as the reference translation.**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** Valitsusväed tõrjusid mässulised tagasi, mässuliste positsioonidele linnast väljas anti ka umbes 30 õhulööki.

**Machine translation:** The government forces rejected the rebels, and the rebel positions outside the city were also given around 30 dinner.

**Reference translation:** Government forces repulsed the rebels , and rebel positions outside the city were given about 30 air strikes .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Verb ""tõrjusid"" is not translated:** The verb ""tõrjusid"" is a past tense verb in Estonian that does not have an exact equivalent in English. The machine translation uses the verb ""rejected"" instead, which is not entirely accurate.
* **""Mässulised tagasi"" is not translated:** The phrase ""mässulised tagasi"" is a compound phrase in Estonian that means ""rebel positions."" The machine translation does not translate this phrase correctly, and instead uses the phrase ""rebel positions.""
* **""Ka umbes 30 õhulööki"" is not translated:** The phrase ""ka umbes 30 õhulööki"" is a quantifier phrase in Estonian that means ""around 30."" The machine translation does not translate this phrase correctly, and instead uses the phrase ""around 30 dinner.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is inaccurate in several places, and it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The main problems with the machine translation are the inaccurate translations of the verb ""tõrjusid,"" the phrase ""mässulised tagasi,"" and the phrase ""ka umbes 30 õhulööki.""

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It is inaccurate in several places, and it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The reference translation is a more accurate and faithful translation of the source text.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source:**

Margna tahab oma naisega abielluda ja kingib Marele reisi Marokosse.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

Margna wants to marry her wife and brings Marek's trip to Morocco to life.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

Margna wants to get married to his girlfriend and gifts Mare a trip to Morocco .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""wife"" instead of ""girlfriend."" This is a common error in machine translation, as the word ""wife"" is often used instead of ""girlfriend"" when the text is not clear about the relationship between the two people.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""trip"" instead of ""journey."" This is also a common error in machine translation, as the word ""trip"" is often used instead of ""journey"" when the text is describing a trip.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text. The source text is in the form ""Margna tahab oma naisega abielluda ja kingib Marele reisi Marokosse."" The machine translation is in the form ""Margna wants to marry her wife and brings Marek's trip to Morocco to life."" This is because the machine translation is trying to make the text more concise and easier to read.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the source text. The source text is in the order ""Margna tahab oma naisega abielluda ja kingib Marele reisi Marokosse."" The machine translation is in the order ""Margna wants to marry her wife and brings Marek's trip to Morocco to life."" This is also because the machine translation is trying to make the text more concise and easier to read.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does make some errors in word choice, sentence structure, and word order. These errors are probably due to the fact that the machine translation is not able to understand the nuances of the Estonian language.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** Ja nagu Wittgenstein ütleb, ei tähenda see tung, et tõsi on miski muu.

**Machine translation:** And, as Wittgenstein says, this feeling does not mean that the truth is something else.

**Reference translation:** And , as Wittgenstein says , this impulse does not mean that something else is true .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* The phrase ""this feeling"" is used instead of ""this impulse.""
* The phrase ""that the truth is something else"" is a direct translation of the Estonian phrase ""et tõsi on miski muu.""
* The use of the word ""feeling"" instead of ""impulse"" is a semantic difference.
* The sentence structure is different, with the use of a compound sentence and a participial phrase.

**Reference translation:**
* The phrase ""this impulse"" is used instead of ""this feeling.""
* The phrase ""that something else is true"" is a more accurate translation of the Estonian phrase ""et tõsi on miski muu.""
* The use of the word ""impulse"" is more precise than the use of ""feeling.""
* The sentence structure is similar to the original text, with the use of a compound sentence and a participial phrase.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but there are some areas where it could be improved. The use of different phrases and the semantic difference between ""feeling"" and ""impulse"" are the most notable issues. The overall quality of the translation is good, but it could be better.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original text than the machine translation. The use of precise language and the accurate translation of the Estonian phrase are the most notable strengths of the reference translation. The overall quality of the translation is excellent.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** See ei ole ka lihtsalt enesemääramise võime, kaalutletud teo võime ega iseendale antud põhjenditele tugineva teo võime.

**Machine translation:** It is not just self-determination, it is not a considered capacity for action, it is not a self-determination, it is not a self-defeating act.

**Reference translation:** It is not just self-determination , the capacity for considered action nor the ability to act based on reasons given to oneself .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""capacity"" instead of ""ability"" in the second sentence. This is not a precise translation, as ""capacity"" is not equivalent to ""ability.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""self-defeating"" instead of ""self-defeating act"" in the third sentence. This is a closer translation, but the phrase ""self-defeating act"" is more idiomatic in English than ""self-defeating.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation restructures the second sentence to be a separate sentence. This is not necessary in the original text, and it makes the translation less clear.
    * The machine translation does not use the same phrasing as the original text in the third sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the second sentence. This is not necessary in the original text, and it makes the translation sound awkward.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is not a bad translation, but it is not as accurate or idiomatic as the reference translation. The main problems with the machine translation are the word choice, sentence structure, and word order.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is the more accurate and idiomatic translation of the original text. It is more faithful to the original text, and it uses more precise language and more idiomatic phrasing.

**Machine translation:** It seems that this consideration has a special force in the case of Jim.

**Reference translation:** It seems that this consideration has a special weight in Jim 's case .

## Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation

**Machine translation:**
* **Force:** Uses the word ""force"" instead of ""weight"".
* **Case:** Uses the phrase ""in the case of Jim"" instead of ""in Jim 's case"".
* **Word choice:** Uses the word ""seems"" instead of ""seems to be"".
* **Grammatical structure:** Changes the sentence structure slightly to fit the English language.

**Reference translation:**
* **Weight:** Uses the word ""weight"" instead of ""force"".
* **Case:** Uses the phrase ""in Jim 's case"" to clarify the subject.
* **Word choice:** Uses the phrase ""seems to be"" to convey a similar meaning to ""seems"".
* **Grammatical structure:** Maintains the original sentence structure.

## Conclusion

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the exact wording and grammar. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text, but it is also more verbose and less concise.

**Machine translation:** It tested, among other things, coal, sails, bricks and sales.

**Reference translation:** He experimented , among other things , with coal , sawdust , brick rubble and mortar .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Lack of verb precision:** The machine translation uses the verb ""tested"" instead of the more precise verb ""experimented"" used in the reference translation.
* **Misplacement of modifiers:** The modifier ""among other things"" is misplaced in the machine translation, which changes the sentence structure and meaning slightly.
* **Use of different synonyms:** The machine translation uses the synonym ""sales"" instead of ""mortar"" used in the reference translation.
* **Lack of parallelism:** The machine translation does not maintain the parallelism of the original sentence structure.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the plural ""bricks.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is of poor quality. It lacks precision, accuracy, and fluency compared to the reference translation. The use of incorrect verbs, misplaced modifiers, and grammatical errors further detracts from the quality of the translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It fails to capture the nuances and precision of the original language, resulting in a translation that is both inaccurate and difficult to read.

    * The machine translation uses the word ""ski"" instead of ""souvenirs"" in the second sentence. ""Ski"" is not related to the text at all.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise and grammatically correct.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""including the killing of rare animals"" in the second sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of words in the second sentence.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""for sale as souvenirs"" in the second sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:**

Ukrainas teatas oma tagasiastumisest kaitsejõudude kindralstaabi ülem kindralpolkovnik Grigori Pedtšenko.

**Machine translation:**

In Ukraine, General Liralpolkovnik Grigori Pedtshenko, the Chief of General Assistance for Defence Forces, announced his resignation.

**Reference translation:**

In Ukraine , Admiral General Grigori Pedtshenko , Chief of the General Staff of the Defence Forces , announced his resignation .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""Liralpolkovnik"" instead of ""Admiral General"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""Assistance"" instead of ""Staff"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, making it more concise.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""of the Defence Forces"" in the second sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of some words in the second sentence.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""in Ukraine"" in the second sentence.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style than the reference translation.
    * The machine translation does not use the same level of formality as the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but there are some differences from the reference translation that could be improved. The word choice and sentence structure are different, and the style is more formal. The machine translation is also missing some important phrases from the reference translation.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved.**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Võimendaja on taustatingimus, mis teeb soosiva põhjendi tugevamaks, kui see muidu oleks.

**Machine translation:** The client is a background condition that makes a favourable reason stronger than it would otherwise be.

**Reference translation:** The amplifier is a background condition that makes a favourable reason stronger than it would otherwise be.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Client instead of amplifier:** The machine translation uses the word ""client"" instead of ""amplifier"" in the source text. This is a semantic error, as the amplifier is the background condition, not the client.
* **Favourable reason instead of favourable reason:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""favourable reason"" instead of ""favourable reason"" in the source text. This is a word choice error, as the phrase ""favourable reason"" is not as precise as the phrase ""favourable reason"" in the source text.
* **Stronger than it would otherwise be:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""stronger than it would otherwise be"" instead of ""stronger than it would otherwise be"" in the source text. This is a phrase structure error, as the phrase ""stronger than it would otherwise be"" is not a direct translation of the phrase ""stronger than it would otherwise be"" in the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does contain some errors in semantics, word choice, and phrase structure. These errors make the translation less precise and fluent than the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for an Estonian-English translation, but it does not provide a high-quality translation. The errors in semantics, word choice, and phrase structure make the translation less precise and fluent than the reference translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is a simple sentence describing the weight of pure gold balls. It uses clear and concise language, and the sentence structure is simple and direct.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but the language is slightly more verbose and the sentence structure is more complex. The phrase ""all tales"" is a creative translation of ""kõik tahked"" and does not fit the context well. The phrase ""are weighed below"" is also a bit awkward and could be replaced with a more concise phrase, such as ""weigh under.""

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of language and sentence structure. It uses clear and concise language, and the sentence structure is simple and direct. The translation of ""kõik tahked"" is accurate and the phrase ""weigh under"" is a good translation of ""kaaluvad alla.""

**Overall evaluation:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main idea of the source text, but the language is slightly more verbose and the sentence structure is more complex. The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of language and sentence structure, and it also maintains the clarity and conciseness of the original text.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Use of more verbose language:** The machine translation uses more verbose language than the reference translation, such as the phrase ""all tales"" and ""are weighed below.""
* **More complex sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the reference translation, which makes the sentence more difficult to read and understand.
* **Inaccurate translation of ""kõik tahked"":** The phrase ""all tales"" does not fit the context of the source text and is not an accurate translation of ""kõik tahked.""
* **Awkward phrasing:** The phrase ""are weighed below"" is awkward and could be replaced with a more concise phrase.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Samal päeval tõmmati Vaivara vanalt kalmistult välja ka täiendust saanud 47. rügemendi I. pataljon ning suunati rindele Krivasoosse.

**Machine translation:** On the same day, 47th embryonic element I. pataljon was also thrown out in an old calibre from the ground and put on the front in crisis.

**Reference translation:** On the same day , the 1st Battalion of the 47th Regiment , which had been upgraded , was withdrawn from the old cemetery of Vaivara and sent to Krivasoo .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the term ""embryonic element"" instead of ""regiment""
* Uses the phrase ""thrown out in an old calibre"" instead of ""withdrawn from the old cemetery""
* Uses the phrase ""put on the front"" instead of ""sent to Krivasoo""

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the term ""regiment"" instead of ""embryonic element""
* Uses the phrase ""withdrawn from the old cemetery"" instead of ""thrown out in an old calibre""
* Uses the phrase ""sent to Krivasoo"" instead of ""put on the front""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The use of incorrect terminology and phrases, such as ""embryonic element"" and ""thrown out in an old calibre,"" makes the translation sound awkward and unnatural. The translation also lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The quality of the Estonian-English translation is fair, but it could be improved. The machine translation is well-written and easy to read, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The use of incorrect terminology and phrases, as well as the lack of precision and clarity, make the translation sound awkward and unnatural.

**Source:** Läänemaalased ründasid kolme üksteisele järgnenud sõjaväega Metsepole ja Lēdurga liivlasi.

**Machine translation:** The West was attacked by the three consecutive armies of Metseo and Lēdurga.

**Reference translation:** The Läänemaa people attacked by the Livonians of Metsepole and Lēdurga with three successive armies .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* The use of the word ""West"" instead of ""Läänemaa"" in the first sentence.
* The omission of the phrase ""Läänemaalased ründasid"" (Läänemaa people attacked).
* The use of the word ""Armies"" instead of ""successive armies"" in the second sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The use of the word ""West"" instead of ""Läänemaa"" is a major deviation from the original text, as the word ""Läänemaa"" is a specific geographical term in Estonia. The omission of the phrase ""Läänemaalased ründasid"" is also a major deviation, as it is an important part of the original text that provides context to the attack. The use of the word ""Armies"" instead of ""successive armies"" is also a deviation, as the word ""successive armies"" is more precise than the word ""armies."" Overall, the machine translation is a good but not perfect translation of the original text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a sentence in Estonian that uses the following key concepts:

* **Võitleb:** Fighting
* **Eest:** For what
* **Usub:** Believes in
* **Vastast:** Against
* **Õõnestaks:** Undermine
* **Võimu:** Power
* **Kogukonnas:** Community

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation captures the main concepts of the source text, but it does not use the same phrasing and word choice. The main differences are:

* **He is fighting for what he already believes in:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""he is fighting for what he already believes in,"" which is similar to the source text, but it does not emphasize the attacking aspect of the sentence.
* **Attacking the fact that he is not undermining this power:** The machine translation does not include the phrase ""the fact that he is not undermining this power."" This phrase is important because it explains the reason for the fighting.
* **So that he is not undermining its power within the community:** The machine translation does not include the phrase ""so that he is not undermining its power within the community."" This phrase is important because it explains the purpose of the fighting.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is closer to the source text in terms of phrasing and word choice. The main differences are:

* **Ründab:** The reference translation uses the word ""ründab"" instead of ""vastast."" This word is more precise and conveys the idea of attacking more forcefully.
* **Vastast:** The reference translation uses the word ""vastast"" instead of ""the fact that he is not undermining this power."" This word is more accurate and conveys the idea of fighting against someone in order to prevent them from doing something.
* **So that he is not undermining its power within the community:** The reference translation includes the phrase ""so that he is not undermining its power within the community."" This phrase is important because it explains the purpose of the fighting.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main concepts of the source text, but it does not use the same phrasing and word choice. The reference translation is closer to the source text in terms of phrasing and word choice, but it does not include some of the nuances of the source text. Overall, the reference translation is the more accurate and faithful translation of the source text.

**Reference translation:** Theories of emotion , like emotions themselves , are ultimately political and important in terms of our sense of power .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It uses fewer words to convey the same meaning.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, ""emotsiooniteooriad"" is translated as ""theories of emotion"" and ""võimutunde seisukohast"" is translated as ""sense of power.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with a dependent clause. The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a more independent clause.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""emotsioonid isegi"" is translated as ""like emotion itself"" in the machine translation, but the phrase ""emotions themselves"" is translated in the same order in the reference translation.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Konfiskeeriti politsei relvad ja vahistati kolm politsei juhtkonda kuulunud isikut, keda kahtlustati koostöös narkomaffiaga.

**Machine translation:** Police weapons were seized and three persons belonging to the police command were arrested, suspected in cooperation with the drug mafia.

**Reference translation:** Police weapons were seized and three persons belonging to the police command were arrested under the suspicion of cooperation with the drug mafia .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""suspected"" instead of ""under the suspicion of.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""persons"" instead of ""three persons.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""cooperation"" instead of ""cooperation with.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, making it more concise.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""under the suspicion of.""
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of some words, for example, ""relvad ja vahistati"" is rearranged to ""weapons were seized and.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the original text. The word choice is different in some places, and the sentence structure is changed slightly. The machine translation also lacks the precision of the reference translation.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it is not as accurate or precise as the reference translation.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** Kuid pärast Jüriado haavatasaamist tõmbuti Grenaderimäele tagasi ja positsioonid jäid venelastele.

**Machine translation:** However, after being wounded by Juriado, the Grenadernem was withdrawn and the positions remained with the Russians.

**Reference translation:** However , after Jüriado was wounded , they retreated to the Grenadier Hill and the positions remained with the Russians .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""Grenadernem"" instead of ""Grenadier Hill.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""positions"" instead of ""positsioonid.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, moving the phrase ""after being wounded"" to the beginning of the sentence.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""they retreated to the Grenadier Hill.""
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words ""tõmbuti"" and ""tagasi.""
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""venelastele.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The word choice is different, the sentence structure is altered, and the word order is rearranged. These differences make the translation sound less natural and less faithful to the original text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good example of the challenges associated with translating Estonian to English. While the translation is mostly accurate, it does not capture the full nuance of the original text. The differences in word choice, sentence structure, and word order make the translation sound less natural and less faithful to the original text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Uus teooria võib lihtsalt vanad teooriad seostada, ilma neid muutmata, nagu näiteks energia jäävuseteooria.

**Machine translation:** The new theory can simply link old theories without changing them, such as energy ice theory.

**Reference translation:** A new theory can simply link old theories without changing them , such as energy persistence theory .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""link old theories"" instead of ""simply link old theories.""
* Omits the phrase ""without changing them.""
* Replaces ""energia jäävuseteooria"" with ""energy ice theory.""

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""simply link old theories"" instead of ""link old theories.""
* Includes the phrase ""without changing them.""
* Replaces ""energia jäävuseteooria"" with ""energy persistence theory.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to understand, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The use of different phrasing and the omission of certain phrases make the translation less faithful to the source text. The replacement of ""energia jäävuseteooria"" with ""energy ice theory"" is particularly problematic, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original term.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more faithful to the original text, as it uses similar phrasing and includes all of the key elements of the source text. However, the use of the phrase ""energy persistence theory"" instead of ""energia jäävuseteooria"" may be confusing for some readers, as the latter term is not as well-known.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the machine translation is more accessible, but the reference translation is more faithful to the original text. The quality of the translation depends on the specific needs of the reader.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Armastusest isikute vastu hoolitakse tavaliselt kõige rohkem.

**Machine translation:** The number of people who are usually the most vulnerable is cared for.

**Reference translation:** Love for people is usually cared for the most.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Focuses on the number of people:** The translation emphasizes the number of people who are vulnerable, rather than the feeling of love.
* **Uses a more clinical tone:** The language is more formal and clinical, rather than the more personal and emotional tone of the reference translation.
* **Does not capture the nuances of the original text:** The translation does not capture the idea of ""armastusest"" (love) as a feeling of care and compassion.

**Reference translation:**
* **Focuses on the feeling of love:** The translation emphasizes the feeling of love for people, rather than the number of people who are vulnerable.
* **Uses a more personal and emotional tone:** The language is more conversational and personal, rather than the more formal and clinical tone of the machine translation.
* **Captures the nuances of the original text:** The translation captures the idea of ""armastusest"" (love) as a feeling of care and compassion.

**Source:** Linnapea kohusetäitjaks nimetati abilinnapea Rafael Amos.

**Machine translation:** The head of city has been appointed deputy director of the aid city at Rafah Amos.

**Reference translation:** Rafael Amos , Vice Mayor , was appointed as the Acting Mayor .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""head of city"" instead of ""Acting Mayor"" in the reference translation. This is a difference in word choice that is due to the different cultural contexts of the two languages. In Estonian, the term ""Linnapea kohusetäitja"" is a specific term that is used to describe the acting mayor. In English, the term ""Acting Mayor"" is a more general term that is used to describe any mayor who is acting in that capacity.
    * The machine translation also uses the word ""aid city"" instead of ""city"" in the reference translation. This is because the word ""aid city"" is a term that is used in Estonian to describe a city that is receiving financial assistance from the government.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure. This is due to the different grammatical rules of the two languages.
    * The machine translation also uses a different verb tense than the reference translation. The reference translation uses the past tense, while the machine translation uses the present tense. This is because the reference translation is talking about a past event, while the machine translation is talking about a future event.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is not of high quality. The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways, including the word choice, sentence structure, and verb tense. These differences are due to the different cultural contexts, grammatical rules, and linguistic conventions of the two languages.

**Reference translation:** Firstly , the good of one individual is of no greater importance than that of another , and the aim must be the good in general .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **More formal:** The phrase ""indiviidi hüvel"" is translated as ""benefit of one individual"" which is more formal than the reference translation's ""good of one individual.""
* **Missing modifier:** The phrase ""eesmärgiks peab olema hüve üldiselt"" is not translated in the machine translation.
* **Different word choice:** The word ""rohkem"" is translated as ""greater"" which is not the closest synonym to the Estonian word ""rohkem.""
* **Lack of parallelism:** The sentence structure is not as parallel as the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**

* **More concise:** The phrase ""ühe indiviidi hüvel ei ole rohkem tähtsust kui teise omal"" is translated more concisely in the reference translation.
* **More direct:** The phrase ""eesmärgiks peab olema hüve üldiselt"" is translated more directly in the reference translation.
* **Similar word choice:** The word ""rohkem"" is translated as ""greater"" which is the closest synonym to the Estonian word ""rohkem.""

In the past, several Gulf states were recognised by the coalition as the representative of Syria's highest power.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

In the past , several Gulf states had recognised the coalition as representing Syria 's highest power .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Verb tense:** The machine translation uses the present tense ""were recognised"" while the reference translation uses the past tense ""had recognised."" This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the context of the sentence as well as the human translator, and therefore assumes that the recognition is still true.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""representative"" while the reference translation uses the word ""had recognised."" This is because the machine translation is not able to find the most appropriate word to use in the context of the sentence.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the sentence to make it more concise. This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the structure of the sentence as well as the human translator.
* **Syntax:** The machine translation uses a different syntax than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the complex syntax of the sentence.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main ideas of the source text, but it is not able to capture the nuances of the language or the context of the sentence. The reference translation is more accurate and fluent than the machine translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Kuid Mihhail Asen I otsustusvõimetus võimaldas Nikaial kogu kaotatud territooriumi tagasi võita, välja arvatud Tsepina.

**Machine translation:** However, the indecision of Mikhail Asen allowed Nicaragua to win back all its lost territory, with the exception of Tsepina.

**Reference translation:** However , the indecision of Mikhail Asen I allowed Nicea to win back all its lost territory , with the exception of Tsepina .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the word ""Nicaragua"" instead of ""Nicea.""
- Omits the word ""with the exception of Tsepina.""
- Uses the phrase ""won back all its lost territory"" instead of ""win back all its lost territory.""

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the word ""Nicea"" instead of ""Nicaragua.""
- Includes the phrase ""with the exception of Tsepina.""
- Uses the phrase ""won back all its lost territory"" instead of ""win back all its lost territory.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it has some errors in grammar and vocabulary. The use of the word ""Nicaragua"" instead of ""Nicea"" is a major error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. The omission of the phrase ""with the exception of Tsepina"" is also a major error, as it does not provide enough context. The use of the phrase ""won back all its lost territory"" instead of ""win back all its lost territory"" is a minor error, but it is still noticeable.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation, but it has some errors in grammar and vocabulary. The use of the word ""Nicaragua"" instead of ""Nicea,"" the omission of the phrase ""with the exception of Tsepina,"" and the use of the phrase ""won back all its lost territory"" instead of ""win back all its lost territory"" are the major errors. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

Ajalooline mõistemoodustus on küll reaalsuse kujutamisele lähem kui loodusteaduslik.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

Historical conception is closer to the perception of reality than natural science.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

Historical formation of concepts is closer to the depiction of reality than that of natural science .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""conception"" instead of ""formation"" in the reference translation. This is a closer translation of the Estonian word ""mõistemoodustus"", which means ""historical formation of concepts"".
    * The machine translation uses the word ""perception"" instead of ""depiction"" in the reference translation. This is a closer translation of the Estonian word ""kujutamisele"", which means ""depiction"".
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is trying to be more concise and to the point.
    * The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation. This is because the reference translation is trying to be more precise and to convey more information.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation follows a more logical order of words than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is trying to be more clear and easy to understand.
    * The reference translation follows a more traditional order of words than the machine translation. This is because the reference translation is trying to be more accurate and to preserve the original meaning of the Estonian text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the Estonian text, but it is not as accurate or as well-written as the reference translation. The machine translation is closer to the perception of reality than the reference translation, but it does not capture the same nuances and precision.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation:**

**Source:** Haralampos V. Harissis ja Anastasios V. Harissis on pakkunud neile sümbolitele välja täiesti teistsuguse seletuse.

**Machine translation:** In Harare and Anastasios V. Haris, these symbols have been given a completely different explanation.

**Reference translation:** Haralampos V. Harissis and Anastasios V. Harissis have proposed a completely different explanation for these symbols .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**Machine translation:**

* **Location:** The machine translation mentions ""Harare and Anastasios V. Haris,"" which is not in the source text.
* **Explanation:** The machine translation says ""have been given a completely different explanation,"" which is not as precise as the reference translation's ""proposed a completely different explanation.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""symbols"" instead of ""symbols"" in the source text.
* **Grammatical structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure from the source text.

**Reference translation:**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It uses fewer words and phrases to convey the same meaning.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, ""shed light"" is replaced with ""could shed light.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. For example, the sentence ""In the 19th century, the physiologists very much opposed Mr von Helmholtz's idea that physical tests could shed light on their area"" is broken up into two sentences in the machine translation.
* **Style:** The machine translation has a more formal style than the reference translation. It uses more complex sentence structure and more formal language.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written, but it does have some errors. The conciseness and the use of different words and phrases are strengths of the machine translation. However, the use of different sentence structure and the formal style are weaknesses of the machine translation. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation**

**Source:** Aafrika rannikule rajati 15. sajandil mitmeid kaubanduspunkte, millest kujunesid hiljem kolooniad.

**Machine translation:** A number of trade points were built on the African coast in the 15th century, which later turned into colonies.

**Reference translation:** A number of trading posts were established on the African coast in the 15th century , which later turned into colonies .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""trade points"" instead of ""trading posts.""
- Omits the phrase ""which later turned into colonies.""
- Does not specify the location of the trade points on the African coast.

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""trading posts"" instead of ""trade points.""
- Includes the phrase ""which later turned into colonies.""
- Specifies the location of the trading posts on the African coast.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it lacks precision and accuracy. The use of the phrase ""trade points"" instead of ""trading posts"" is a minor error, but it does not egregate the overall meaning of the text. The omission of the phrase ""which later turned into colonies"" is a more significant error, as it does not provide enough context or information about the history of the trade points. The lack of specificity in the location of the trade points is also a problem, as it does not provide enough information for the reader to understand the exact location of the trade points.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for a translation of the source text, but it lacks precision and accuracy. The use of incorrect phrasing, the omission of important information, and the lack of specificity all contribute to the overall low quality of the translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Reference translation:** In the QS World University Rankins of 2016 , ANU was the highest-placed Australian university and 22nd in the world .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""highest"" instead of ""highest-placed"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""in Australia"" instead of ""in the QS World University Rankins of 2016"" in the reference translation.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text.**

The source text is a quote from a philosophical text in Estonian. It is about the value of an act and its relationship to duty.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-structured and captures the main points of the source text. However, it does not use the same phrasing as the original text and some of the nuances of the original text are lost in translation.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation.**

The reference translation is closer to the original text in terms of phrasing and style. It also captures the main points of the source text more accurately.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Phrasing:** The machine translation uses more formal phrasing than the original text and the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""kohuses, st mingis soovist või kalduvusest tulevas sihis"" is translated as ""in any other place than the duty, that is to say in any place coming from a desire or a propensity."" This phrase is much longer and more formal than the original phrase ""kohuses, st mingis soovist või kalduvusest tulevas sihis.""
* **Nuances:** The machine translation does not capture some of the nuances of the original text. For example, the original text talks about the ""target"" of an act, while the machine translation talks about the ""purpose"" of an act. This is because the machine translation does not have the same understanding of the word ""target"" as the original text.
* **Style:** The machine translation has a more formal style than the original text and the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is trying to be as accurate as possible and does not take into account the style of the original text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a well-structured and accurate translation of the source text. However, it does not capture some of the nuances of the original text and the phrasing is different. The reference translation is closer to the original text in terms of phrasing and style, and it also captures the main points of the source text more accurately.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Reading the Source Text and Reference Translation**

The source text is in Estonian and describes the main responsibility of the mandator (client) in paying a fee to the agent (facilitator) in a contract. The reference translation is in English and accurately summarizes the source text.

**Step 2: Comparing Machine Translation to Reference Translation**

The machine translation (MT) is similar to the reference translation in many ways. It correctly identifies the main responsibility of the mandator and mentions the payment of a fee. However, there are some key differences between the MT and the reference translation:

* **Word choice:** The MT uses the word ""agent"" instead of ""mandator."" This is an inaccuracy as the word ""agent"" is not always the best translation for ""mandator"" in this context.
* **Sentence structure:** The MT uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The MT uses a more complex sentence structure with a compound predicate, while the reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a single predicate.
* **Word order:** The MT changes the order of some words in the sentence compared to the reference translation.
* **Phrasing:** The MT uses different phrasing than the reference translation.

**Step 3: Analysis of the Differences**

The differences between the MT and the reference translation are mostly due to the different linguistic conventions between Estonian and English. The MT is able to capture the meaning of the source text, but it does not always use the same words or sentence structure as the reference translation.

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Overall, the MT is a good translation of the source text, but it could be improved. The main differences between the MT and the reference translation are due to the different linguistic conventions between Estonian and English. The MT is able to capture the meaning of the source text, but it does not always use the same words or sentence structure as the reference translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:**

Alfons Rebane tegi Wagnerile ettepaneku, et tema võitlusgrupp oleks linnas edasi liikunud mööda Emajõe kallast, piirates sillapea sisse.

**Machine translation:**

Alfons Rebane proposed to Wagner that his fight group should have moved on to the city's shores, restricting the bridge's head.

**Reference translation:**

Alfons Rebane proposed to Wagner that his fight group would have moved on in the city along the bank of Emajõgi , surrounding the bridgehead .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""shores"" instead of ""bank"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""restricting"" instead of ""surrounding"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to a more concise form.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""along the bank of Emajõgi"" from the source text.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of words in the sentence.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""bridge's head"" to the end of the sentence.
* **Syntax:**
    * The machine translation uses a different syntax than the source text.
    * The machine translation does not use the same verb tense as the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text. The word choice and sentence structure are different from the source text, and the translation does not include some of the phrases from the source text. Overall, the machine translation is a good approximation of the source text, but it is not as accurate as the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Source:**
pisivasakulMahleri teine loomingumajake [[Klagenfurti lähedal Maierniggis, Wörthersee kaldal

**Machine Translation:**
Second Livestock of the Power Left Mahler [near Klagenfurt in Maiernigg, Wörtheras on the side of Maiernigg

**Reference Translation:**
pisivasakulMahler 's second creative cabin near [ [ Klagenfurt in Maiernigg , on the shore of Wörthersee

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the phrase ""Second Livestock of the Power Left Mahler"" which is not present in the source text.
    * The reference translation uses the phrase ""pisivasakulMahler 's second creative cabin"" which is more accurate to the source text.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation restructures the sentence to fit a more formal English structure.
    * The reference translation preserves the original sentence structure.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of words in the sentence.
    * The reference translation maintains the original word order.
* **Punctuation:**
    * The machine translation uses different punctuation than the reference translation.
    * The reference translation uses more accurate punctuation.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style.
    * The reference translation has a more conversational style.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the quality of the machine translation is not as high as the quality of the reference translation. The machine translation has made some errors in word choice, sentence structure, word order, punctuation, and style. The reference translation is more accurate to the source text and has a higher quality of translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation

**Source:**
Bangladeshis Chittagongis toimus mereväebaasis plahvatus, milles sai raskelt vigastada 6 mereväelast.

**Machine translation:**
In Chittagoni, Bangladesh, there was an explosion on a naval base which caused serious injuries to 6 navies.

**Reference translation:**
In Chittagong , Bangladesh , there was an explosion on a naval base which caused serious injuries to 6 marines .

## Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation

**Machine translation:**
* **Navies:** The machine translation uses the word ""navies"" instead of ""marines"" in the reference translation. This is a common error made by machine translation systems, as the word ""navy"" is often used interchangeably with ""marine.""
* **Plahvatus:** The machine translation uses the word ""plahvatus"" which is not a word in English. This word is a transliteration of the Estonian word ""plahvatus,"" which means ""explosion.""
* **Meres:** The machine translation uses the word ""mereväelast"" which is a word in Estonian that does not have an exact equivalent in English. This word refers to soldiers who are part of the navy.
* **Base:** The machine translation uses the word ""base"" to refer to the naval base, while the reference translation uses the word ""base"" in a more specific sense to refer to a particular location within the naval base.

## Conclusion

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways. The most significant differences are the use of different words for ""marines,"" ""plahvatus,"" ""mereväelast,"" and ""base."" These differences are due to the different languages that the source and reference translations are written in.

* **Tool for engineers** instead of **became a tool for engineers**

**Reference translation:**

* **Ceased to generate** new problems instead of **ceased to give up** new problems.
* **Became a tool for engineers** instead of **became a tool for engineers**

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""ceased to give up"" is a common error in machine translation, and it is not the best equivalent for the phrase ""ceased to generate"" in this context. The machine translation also lacks the use of the phrase ""became a tool for engineers,"" which is a key phrase in the original text.

**Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved.**

**Source:** Illumineerivam oleks mõelda Pedro projektide mõjust Jimi otsusele, mitte Jimi projektide mõjust Pedrole.

**Machine translation:** It would be more illuminating to think about the impact of Pedro's projects on Jim's decision and not about the impact of Jim projects on the paedophiles.

**Reference translation:** It would be more illuminating to think about the impact of Pedro 's projects on Jim 's decision and not about the impact of Jim projects on Pedro .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Misinterpretation:** The machine translation incorrectly assumes that the phrase ""Jimi projektide mõjust Pedrole"" is referring to the impact of Jim's projects on pedophiles. This is not the case.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""paedophiles"" which is a highly inappropriate and offensive term.
* **Syntax:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure from the source to a more complex one, which is not necessary.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence, which makes the sentence more difficult to read.

**Reference translation:**

* **Accuracy:** The reference translation accurately translates the source text, including the use of the phrase ""Jimi projektide mõjust Pedrole"" to refer to the impact of Jim's projects on Pedro.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses more precise and appropriate words than the machine translation, such as ""impact"" instead of ""influence.""
* **Syntax:** The reference translation maintains the original sentence structure, which is clear and concise.
* **Word order:** The reference translation preserves the order of the words in the sentence, which makes the sentence easy to read.

**Conclusion:**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is a formal academic statement. It uses specific terminology related to scientific discourse, such as ""abduktsioon,"" ""arutlus,"" ""proposition,"" and ""hüpoteesi."" The text also employs a complex sentence structure and uses passive voice frequently.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the formal style and terminology. The translation uses simpler language and more active voice. It also deviates from the original sentence structure and uses a more conversational tone.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is closer to the original text in terms of style and terminology. It uses more formal language and preserves the original sentence structure. However, it does not fully capture the nuances of the original text, such as the use of passive voice and the specific terminology related to scientific discourse.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Style:** The machine translation uses a more conversational tone, while the reference translation uses a more formal tone.
* **Terminology:** The machine translation does not use all of the specialized terminology used in the source text, such as ""abduktsioon"" and ""hüpoteesi.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation deviates from the original sentence structure, while the reference translation preserves it more closely.
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, even though they may have similar meaning.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the formal style and terminology. The reference translation is closer to the original text in terms of style and terminology, but it does not fully capture the nuances of the original text.

**Recommendations:**

In order to improve the quality of the translation, the following steps could be taken:

* Use a translation tool that is specifically designed for academic text.
* Use a bilingual dictionary to find synonyms for specialized terminology.
* Pay attention to the sentence structure and style of the original text.
* Read the translated text aloud to identify any awkward phrasing or grammatical errors.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Ta usub, et tema väärtus on suurenenud, sest ta on võitnud kedagi, kellel on üldtunnustatult väga kõrge väärtusaste.

**Machine translation:** He believes that his value has increased because he has won someone who has, in general, very high values.

**Reference translation:** He believes that his value has increased because he has won over someone who is generally deemed to have a very high level of value.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""values"" instead of ""level of value."" This is a closer translation of the Estonian word ""väärtus,"" but it does not have the same nuance as the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""won"" instead of ""won over."" This is a more literal translation of the Estonian word ""võitnud,"" but it does not capture the same sense of accomplishment as the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is trying to be more concise and direct, while the reference translation is more verbose and ornate.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is trying to be more logical and clear, while the reference translation is more idiomatic and rhythmic.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation is more formal and objective than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is trying to be more neutral and unbiased, while the reference translation is more personal and subjective.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not capture all of the nuances of the original text. The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text, but it is also more verbose and ornate. Overall, the best translation for this text would depend on the specific needs of the reader.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** See võib viia meeleheitele, nagu ka teleoloogiliselt tähendusliku maailma kaotamine.

**Machine translation:** This may lead to despair, as well as the loss of the world of teleological significance.

**Reference translation:** This may lead to despair , as well as the loss of a teleologically significant world .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Despair"" is a strong word that is not necessarily the best translation of ""meeleheitele."" A more nuanced word, such as ""sadness"" or ""gloom,"" might be more appropriate.
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is different between the machine translation and the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more formal structure, while the machine translation uses a more conversational structure.
* **Word order:** The word order is different in the machine translation and the reference translation. The reference translation follows a more logical order, while the machine translation follows a more idiomatic order.
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation does not use as much filler words, such as ""the"" and ""of.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** Keenias kuulutas kohtute sõltumatust uurinud erikomisjon neli kõrgemat kohtunikku ametisse sobimatuks.

**Machine translation:** In Kenya, the independence of the courts was declared unfit for the office of four senior judges by the Special committee.

**Reference translation:** In Kenya , four senior judges were declared unfit for the office by a special committee on the independence of the courts .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation, removing the phrase ""neli kõrgemat kohtunikku"" (four senior judges).
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""office"" instead of ""position"" in the phrase ""ametisse sobimatuks.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation, combining the first two sentences of the source text into one sentence.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words ""Kenya"" and ""courts"" compared to the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**

* **Precision:** The reference translation is more precise than the machine translation, specifying ""neli kõrgemat kohtunikku"" (four senior judges).
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses the word ""position"" instead of ""office"" in the phrase ""ametisse sobimatuks.""
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation, breaking the second sentence of the source text into two sentences.
* **Word order:** The reference translation follows the same order of words as the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The conciseness and different sentence structure may be seen as advantages by some, while others may find them to be too simplified or unnatural.

**Conclusion:**

The quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved by being more precise and using more of the nuances of the source text.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""seafaring"" instead of ""based"" in the first sentence. This is not a precise translation and does not capture the same meaning as the original text.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""men"" instead of ""marines"" in the second sentence. This is also not a precise translation and does not capture the same meaning as the original text.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the original text to make it more concise and easier to read. This may have lost some of the original meaning and flow.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""who are currently based on Okinawa"" in the second sentence. This is important information that is missing from the machine translation.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the second sentence. This may be due to the different sentence structure, but it also may have changed the meaning of the sentence.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source:**

The source text is a sentence in Estonian that states the argument that certain principles are generalisations of experience on physical addition and subtraction.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation accurately captures the main idea of the source text, but it uses different phrasing and word choice than the reference translation. The phrase ""generalisations of experience"" is a good translation of the Estonian phrase ""kogemuse üldistused"", but the phrase ""physical unification and lahutamise"" is not a perfect translation of ""füüsilise liitmise ja lahutamise"". The Estonian word ""füüsilise"" is a very specific term that is not easily translated into English.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text than the machine translation. The phrase ""experiential generalisations"" is a good translation of ""kogemuse üldistused"", and the phrase ""physical addition and subtraction"" is a more precise translation of ""füüsilise liitmise ja lahutamise"".

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good overall translation of the source text, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the Estonian word ""füüsilise"". The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text, but it uses different phrasing and word choice than the machine translation.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The fundamental principles were described in Lakato as the core of the research programme.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

Lakatos called the fundamental principles the hard core of the research program .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""described"" instead of ""called."" This is a semantic error, as ""described"" is not as strong as ""called.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""core"" instead of ""hard core."" This is a lexical error, as ""core"" is not a perfect synonym for ""hard core.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure from the original text. The original text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses a simple sentence. This changes the rhythm and flow of the sentence.
    * The machine translation moves the modifier ""as the core"" to the end of the sentence. This is a syntactic error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence. The original text has the order ""Fundamentaalseid printsiipe nimetas Lakatos uurimisprogrammi kõvaks tuumaks."" The machine translation has the order ""The fundamental principles were described in Lakato as the core of the research programme."" This changes the flow and rhythm of the sentence.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Rahuvalvejõud olid jõuetud, sest lisaks ressursipuudusele polnud neil ka õigust sekkuda.

**Machine translation:** The peacekeeping forces were powerless because, in addition to the shortage of resources, they did not have the right to intervene.

**Reference translation:** The peacekeeping forces were powerless because , in addition to the shortage of resources , they did not have the right to intervene .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It combines the second and third sentences of the source text into one sentence in the translation.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""powerless"" instead of ""ineffective"" and ""intervene"" instead of ""engage.""
* **Syntax:** The machine translation has a different syntax than the reference translation. The source text uses a complex sentence structure with a dependent clause, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a subordinate clause.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the source text. For example, the phrase ""ressursipuudusele polnud neil ka õigust sekkuda"" is rearranged in the machine translation to ""they did not have the right to intervene because of the shortage of resources.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The conciseness and different word choice make the translation sound a bit different from the original text. The syntax and word order changes also make the translation sound less natural.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it does not match the quality of the reference translation.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source text:** Enne sööki pestakse ühises kausikeses käsi, sest nsima't süüakse käega.

**Machine translation:** Before eating, they wash their hands in the common roof, because they are cooked with their hands.

**Reference translation:** Before eating , they wash their hands in a shared bowl , because Nsima is eaten with hands .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Common roof:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""common roof"" to translate the phrase ""ühises kausikeses käsi."" This is not accurate, as the phrase ""ühises kausikeses käsi"" refers to a shared bowl, not a common roof.
* **Cooked with their hands:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""cooked with their hands"" to translate the phrase ""nsima't süüakse käega."" This is also not accurate, as the phrase ""nsima't süüakse käega"" refers to the act of eating Nsima with hands, not the act of cooking with hands.

**Reference translation:**

* **Shared bowl:** The reference translation uses the phrase ""shared bowl"" to translate the phrase ""ühises kausikeses käsi."" This is accurate, as the phrase ""ühises kausikeses käsi"" refers to a shared bowl.
* **Eaten with hands:** The reference translation uses the phrase ""eaten with hands"" to translate the phrase ""nsima't süüakse käega."" This is also accurate, as the phrase ""nsima't süüakse käega"" refers to the act of eating Nsima with hands.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. The most significant differences are the use of the phrase ""common roof"" instead of ""shared bowl,"" and the use of the phrase ""cooked with their hands"" instead of ""eaten with hands."" These differences are due to the fact that the machine translation is not able to understand the specific context of the text, and therefore makes inaccurate translations.

Urban networks in another Bulgarian federal state grew in the 13th and 14th centuries, and numerous new city centres emerged.

**Reference translation:**
The network of cities in the Second Bulgarian Empire grew in the 13th and 14th centuries , and numerous new city centres emerged .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""federal"" to describe the Bulgarian state, while the reference translation uses ""Second Bulgarian Empire.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""networks"" to describe the city network, while the reference translation uses ""network.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""new"" to describe the city centres, while the reference translation does not.

* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses a compound sentence to describe the growth of the city network and the emergence of new city centres.
    * The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure to describe the growth of the city network and the emergence of new city centres.

* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of words in the sentence compared to the reference translation.
    * The machine translation places the phrase ""in the 13th and 14th centuries"" after the phrase ""grew in.""
    * The reference translation places the phrase ""in the 13th and 14th centuries"" before the phrase ""grew in.""

* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style than the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses more complex vocabulary and sentence structure.
    * The reference translation has a more conversational style.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including word choice, sentence structure, word order, and style. These differences are due to the different ways in which the two translations interpret the source text. The machine translation is more formal and uses more complex vocabulary and sentence structure, while the reference translation is more conversational and uses a more complex sentence structure.

**Reference translation:** In turn , the parish government applied to the police to check the charges .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""government"" instead of ""parish government."" This is not a perfect translation as the original text uses the word ""parish government,"" which is more specific to Estonia than ""government.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""charges"" instead of ""offenses."" This is also not a perfect translation as the original text uses the word "" süüdistuste"" which specifically refers to charges related to administrative offenses, not criminal offenses.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the original text to make it more concise. This may be acceptable in some cases, but it does not preserve the original flow and rhythm of the text.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** 1932. aastal liitunud Iraak oli esimene liikmesriik, mis oli varem ühtlasi olnud Rahvasteliidu mandaatala.

**Machine translation:** Iraq, which joined in 1932, was the first Member State to have been the mandate of the UPM.

**Reference translation:** Iraq , which joined in 1932 , was the first member state that had been a mandate territory of the League of Nations .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Use of the term ""UPM"" instead of ""League of Nations"":** The machine translation uses the acronym ""UPM"" instead of the full name ""League of Nations."" This is a common error in translation, as the acronym is not always known to English speakers.
* **Lack of specificity:** The machine translation does not specify the ""mandate territory"" of the League of Nations. It simply states that Iraq was the first member state to have been the mandate of the UPM.
* **Use of the term ""Member State"" instead of ""member state"":** The machine translation uses the term ""Member State"" instead of ""member state."" This is a minor error, but it is still noticeable.

**Reference translation:**
* **Use of the full name ""League of Nations"":** The reference translation uses the full name ""League of Nations"" instead of the acronym ""UPM."" This is more accurate, as the League of Nations was a specific organization with a unique name.
* **Specificity:** The reference translation specifies the ""mandate territory"" of the League of Nations as ""a mandate territory."" This is more precise than the machine translation.
* **Use of the term ""member state"":** The reference translation uses the term ""member state"" instead of ""Member State."" This is more accurate, as the term ""member state"" is more commonly used in this context.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some errors in terms of specificity and terminology. The reference translation is more accurate and precise, as it uses the full name of the organization, specifies the mandate territory, and uses the correct terminology.

**Key differences:**

* **Subject:** The source text talks about ""elukat"" (creatures), while the machine translation talks about ""life.""
* **Verb ""iseht"" (understand)**: The source text uses the verb ""iseht"" (understand) in the sense of ""being understood,"" while the machine translation uses the verb ""is understood"" in the sense of ""being perceived.""
* **Subordinate species:** The source text mentions ""subnative liikidega"" (subordinate species), while the machine translation mentions ""subnative species.""
* **Genus:** The reference translation uses the word ""genus"" to describe the relationship between a creature and its subordinate species. The machine translation does not use this term.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:**
Ordu lähemaks eesmärgiks peab ta ülestõusu leviku peatamist ja läbirääkimiste teel aja võitmist vägede Kogumiseks.

**Machine translation:**
It must aim more closely to halt the spread of the uprising and to gain time through negotiation to gather troops.

**Reference translation:**
He believes that the immediate goal of the Order is to halt the spread of the uprising and to gain time through negotiation to gather troops.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **More direct:** The machine translation is more direct, focusing primarily on the task of halting the spread of the uprising and gaining time through negotiation.
* **Lack of explanation:** The machine translation lacks the explanation of the ""immediate goal"" and the connection to the Order.
* **Missing modifier:** The machine translation is missing the modifier ""he believes"" that is present in the reference translation.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""aim"" instead of ""believe"" and ""spread"" instead of ""uprising.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a different sentence structure than the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and captures the main idea of the source text. However, it lacks the nuance and precision of the reference translation. The lack of explanation and the missing modifier make the translation less clear and complete. The different word choice and sentence structure also contribute to the overall feeling of being less polished.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good starting point, but it could be improved by providing more explanation and precision. The reference translation is the more accurate and well-written translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

    * The machine translation uses the word ""mandate entered into force"" instead of ""entered into force"" in the second sentence.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation.
* **Grammatical errors:**
    * The machine translation has a grammatical error in the second sentence.
    * The machine translation uses incorrect verb tense.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Aga sel juhul peab esimese teo pretsedendiks pidamine põhinema segiajamisel.

**Machine translation:** In this case, however, setting a precedent for the first act must be based on adventures.

**Reference translation:** In this case , however , setting a precedent for the first act must be based on confusion .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Replaces ""segiajamisel"" with ""adventures.""** This is a semantic error, as ""segiajamisel"" is a word that specifically means ""confusion"" in Estonian, while ""adventures"" does not have the same meaning.
* **Changes the verb ""peab"" to ""must be based.""** This is a grammatical error, as ""peab"" is a modal verb in Estonian that is translated to ""should"" in English, not ""must be based.""
* **Changes the phrase ""aga sel juhul"" to ""in this case.""** This is a stylistic error, as ""aga sel juhul"" is a phrase that is used in Estonian to indicate a specific situation, while ""in this case"" is a more general phrase.

**Reference translation:**

* **Maintains the original word ""segiajamisel.""**
* **Uses the correct verb ""peab"" in the translation.**
* **Maintains the original phrase ""aga sel juhul.""**

**Step 3: Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation due to several errors, including semantic errors, grammatical errors and stylistic errors. These errors make the translation difficult to understand and inaccurate. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text and is more accurate in terms of meaning and grammar.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is a simple sentence in Estonian that uses the verb ""hoida"" (meaning ""prevent"") in the perfect tense. The sentence also includes the adverb ""iga kord"" (meaning ""every time"") and the demonstrative pronoun ""sündmust"" (meaning ""event"").

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation is a good overall translation of the source text, but it has some inaccuracies.

**Differences from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""prevent"" instead of ""prevent"" in the reference translation. This is a common error in machine translation, as the word ""prevent"" is not a perfect synonym for ""hoida.""
* **Verb tense:** The machine translation uses the simple past tense instead of the perfect tense in the source text. This is because the machine translator is not able to accurately identify the tense of the verb ""hoida.""
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words ""iga kord"" and ""sündmust"" from the source text. This is because the machine translator is not able to accurately identify the syntax of the sentence.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is a good translation of the source text that is faithful to the original meaning and grammar.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good overall translation of the source text, but it has some inaccuracies. The main inaccuracies are the word choice, verb tense, and word order. The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Aastal 1265 vallutas sultan Baibars Caesarea, Haifa ja Arsufi; aastal 1266 Safadi ja Toroni.

**Machine translation:** In 1265, Baibars Caesarea, Haifa and Arsufi were seized; 1266 Safe and Toron were closed in 2009.

**Reference translation:** In 1265 , Sultan Baibars occupied Caesarea , Haifa and Arsuf ; in 1266 , Safad and Toron .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""seized"" instead of ""occupied"" in the first sentence. This is a semantic error, as ""seized"" implies a forced taking of possession, while ""occupied"" implies a more gradual process of taking control.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""closed"" instead of ""Safad"" in the second sentence. This is a lexical error, as ""closed"" does not fit the context of the sentence, as Safad is a place, not a time period.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text, making it less clear and concise.
    * The machine translation uses a different verb tense in the second sentence, making it inconsistent with the first sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of words in the second sentence, making it less logical.
    * The machine translation uses a different word order for the conjunction ""in"" in the second sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of good quality due to several errors in word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The semantic and lexical errors are particularly problematic, as they change the meaning of the text. The changes to sentence structure and word order also make the text less clear and concise.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a faithful or accurate translation of the source text. The numerous errors in word choice, sentence structure, and word order make it difficult to understand and interpret the text.

**Machine translation:**

* **Inaccurate verb conjugation:** ""Vallutasid"" is not the correct conjugation of the verb ""valluta"" in Estonian. The correct conjugation is ""Vallutasid"".
* **Misplaced modifier:** ""Where there were Hutu refugees to Tanzania"" is a misplaced modifier. The modifier ""where there were Hutu refugees to Tanzania"" should be moved to the end of the sentence.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the ""eastern part"" of the source text. It simply says ""East"".
* **Use of colloquial language:** The phrase ""Hutu refugees to Tanzania"" is a colloquial phrase that is not appropriate for formal writing.

**Reference translation:**

* **Precise verb conjugation:** ""Invaded"" is the correct conjugation of the verb ""invad"" in Estonian.
* **Correct modifier placement:** ""From where the Hutu escapted to Tanzania"" is the correct placement of the modifier.
* **Precision:** The reference translation specifies the ""eastern part"" of the source text.
* **Formal language:** The reference translation uses formal language and avoids the use of colloquial phrases.

**Source text:** Ranniku ja jõgede lähedal on suur osa metsast maha võetud.

**Machine translation:** A large part of the forest has been taken off the coast and along the rivers.

**Reference translation:** A large part of the forest has been cut down near the coast and rivers.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""taken off"" instead of ""cut down."" This is a semantic error, as ""taken off"" is not an appropriate synonym for ""cut down.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure from the original text, making it more concise.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words ""coast"" and ""rivers.""
* **Preposition:**
    * The machine translation uses the preposition ""along"" instead of ""near.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality due to the presence of semantic errors, changes in sentence structure, word order, and preposition usage. The translation is not faithful to the original text and does not convey the same meaning.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It is different from the reference translation in numerous ways, including word choice, sentence structure, word order, and preposition usage. The resulting translation is not of high quality and does not accurately reflect the original text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

**Source:** See võimalus on igasugusele määratletud reaalsusele olemuslik.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

**Machine translation:** This opportunity is intrinsic to any established reality.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

**Reference translation:** This opportunity is intrinsic to any established reality.

**4. Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:**

**Machine translation:**

* **Grammatical errors:** The sentence structure is incorrect. The word ""intrinsic"" is not the best translation for ""igasugusele"" and should be ""inherent.""
* **Word choice:** The word ""opportunity"" is a good translation for ""võimalus,"" but the word ""established"" is not the best translation for ""määratletud"" and should be ""defined.""
* **Lack of precision:** The translation does not specify what ""reaalsusele olemuslik"" means. The reference translation is more precise and states that the opportunity is ""intrinsic to any established reality.""

**5. Conclusion:**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some errors in grammar, word choice, and precision. The reference translation is more precise and accurate.

**Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved.**

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Kiirabis kasutatavad ravimid sobivad ennekõike eluohtlike seisundite raviks.

**Machine translation:** Pharmaceutical products used in the country are primarily suitable for treating life-threatening conditions.

**Reference translation:** Pharmaceutical products used in emergency medicine are primarily suitable for treating life-threatening conditions.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Context:** The source text mentions ""Kiirabis kasutatavad ravimid"" which translates to ""pharmaceutical products used in emergency medicine."" The reference translation uses ""emergency medicine"" instead of ""Kiirabis kasutatavad ravimid."" This is because the reference translation is more concise and to the point, while the machine translation tries to preserve the exact meaning of the source text.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses ""primarily"" instead of ""mainly"" in the second sentence. This is because the machine translation is trying to be more neutral and avoid making strong claims.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the sentences slightly compared to the source text. This is because the machine translation is trying to make the sentence structure more logical and flow better in English.
* **Style:** The machine translation is more formal and less conversational than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is trying to be more professional and avoid using slang or colloquial language.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does differ from the reference translation in some areas. The main differences are due to the different contexts, word choice, word order, and style. These differences are minor and do not significantly impact the overall meaning of the text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Reference translation:** In Georgia , the Commander of the Joint Headquarters of the Defence Forces , Georgi Kalandadze , was arrested under the suspicion of acting in excess of his powers .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Omission of the phrase ""under the suspicion of acting in excess of his powers"":** The machine translation does not include the phrase ""under the suspicion of acting in excess of his powers,"" which is present in the reference translation. This phrase is important because it clarifies the reason for Kalandadze's arrest and provides additional context to the situation.
* **Use of the phrase ""crossing the borders of power"":** The machine translation uses the phrase ""crossing the borders of power,"" which is not present in the source text. This phrase is a metaphor that is not appropriate in this context and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text.
* **Different word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""arrest"" instead of ""arrest under suspicion"" and ""power"" instead of ""powers.""

**Machine translation:** The Pope met with Hindus on 7 May 1980 and 18 August 1985.

**Reference translation:** The Pope met with Kenyan Hindus on 7 May 1980 and 18 August 1985 .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Lack of specificity:**
- The machine translation lacks the specificity of the source and reference translations. It simply states ""Hindus"" instead of ""Kenyan Hindus,"" which is important because it misinterprets the original text.

**2. Incorrect verb tense:**
- The machine translation uses the incorrect verb tense ""met"" instead of ""met with"" in the second sentence. This is a grammatical error that is not present in the source or reference translations.

**3. Missing modifier:**
- The machine translation lacks the modifier ""Kenyan"" in the second sentence. This modifier is important for clarity and accuracy, as it specifies the nationality of the Hindus.

**4. Incorrect word choice:**
- The machine translation uses the word ""Hinduist"" instead of ""Hindu"" in the first sentence. This is a semantic error that does not accurately reflect the original text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality:**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks the specificity, correct verb tense, and modifier of the reference translation. It also has some errors in word choice. Overall, the quality of the translation is good, but it could be improved.

**Additional notes:**

- The source text is in Estonian, so the translation process involves two steps: Estonian-English and English-English.
- The reference translation is the most accurate and faithful translation of the source text.
- The machine translation is a good starting point for translation, but it should be revised and edited to improve the accuracy and quality of the translation.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

**Mitte et moraalifilosoofiat ei peaks huvitama, mida me ütleme.**

This text is a quote from the Estonian philosopher Jaan Kallas. It translates to ""Not that a moral philosophy should be of interest to what we say.""

**2. Read the machine translation:**

**Not that a moral mockery should be of interest to what we say.**

This is the machine translation of the source text. It is accurate in terms of content, but the language is slightly different from the original text.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

**Not that a moral philosophy should be of interest to what we say .**

This is the reference translation of the source text. It is very similar to the original text, but there are some minor differences in phrasing and word choice.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""mockery"" instead of ""philosophy."" This is a common mistake in translation, as the word ""mockery"" is not a perfect synonym for ""philosophy.""
* **Phrasing:** The machine translation uses a different phrasing than the original text and the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""mitte et moraalifilosoofiat ei peaks huvitama"" is translated as ""Not that a moral philosophy should be of interest to what we say."" This phrase is not exactly equivalent to the original text, which says ""Mitte et moraalifilosoofiat ei peaks huvitama, mida me ütleme.""
* **Syntax:** The machine translation uses a different syntax than the original text and the reference translation. For example, the original text uses a subordinate clause to modify the main clause. The machine translation does not use a subordinate clause.

**Overall, the machine translation is accurate in terms of content, but the language is slightly different from the original text.** The main differences are in word choice, phrasing, and syntax.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

**Reference translation:** The women of three different generations are having serious talk .

**4. Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""serious"" instead of ""serious talk"" in the source text. This is a common error in machine translation, where the translator may not be able to identify the specific meaning of the word ""serious"" in this context.
    * The reference translation uses the same word ""serious talk"" as the source text. This is more accurate, as it captures the specific meaning of the phrase in the source text.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure than the source text. This is because the machine translator may not be able to handle the complex sentence structure in the source text.
    * The reference translation uses a similar sentence structure to the source text. This is more accurate, as it preserves the original meaning and flow of the sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence. This is because the machine translator may not be able to identify the correct word order for the sentence.
    * The reference translation preserves the order of the words in the sentence. This is more accurate, as it preserves the original meaning of the sentence.

**Overall, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. The main differences are in word choice, sentence structure, and word order. These differences are due to the limitations of machine translation technology.**

**Source:** Sellepärast peab see olema teispool empiirilisi määratlusi.

**Machine translation:** It must therefore be a cross-border definition.

**Reference translation:** It must therefore be beyond empirical definitions.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The source uses the word ""peab"" which translates to ""must"" in the reference translation, but ""cross-border"" in the machine translation.
    * The word ""empiirilisi"" translates to ""empirical"" in the reference translation, but is not translated in the machine translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The source uses a complex sentence structure with a modal verb (""peab"") and a participial phrase (""olema teispool empiirilisi määratlusi"").
    * The machine translation simplifies the sentence structure and uses a more direct translation (""It must therefore be a cross-border definition"").
    * The reference translation also simplifies the sentence structure but uses a different phrasing (""It must therefore be beyond empirical definitions"").
* **Style:**
    * The source has a more formal and academic style.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Canberra päevale eelneb tihtipeale kümnepäevane ürituste sari Celebrate Canberra.

**Machine translation:** Canberra's day is often preceded by a ten-day series of events in Celebrate Canberra.

**Reference translation:** Canberra Day is often preceded by a ten-day series of events , Celebrate Canberra .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""series"" instead of ""series of events.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""in"" instead of ""by"" after ""events.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""Celebrate"" instead of ""Celebrate Canberra.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure from the source to a more complex structure.
    * The machine translation moves the modifier ""ten-day"" closer to the noun ""series.""
    * The machine translation changes the verb ""precedes"" to ""is often preceded.""
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words ""ten-day"" and ""series"" compared to the source.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""Celebrate Canberra"" to the end of the sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it does make some changes to the original text that are not necessary. The word choice is not always the best, and the sentence structure is more complex than the original text. The word order is also different from the original text. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is very similar to the original text. The word choice is accurate, and the sentence structure is simple and clear. The word order is also very similar to the original text. Overall, the reference translation is a very good translation.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is the best translation of the original text. It is accurate, clear, and concise. The machine translation is also a good translation, but it does make some changes to the original text that are not necessary.

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:**
Niivõrd kui Newtoni teooria on olnud tõeliselt teaduslik teooria, mida toetavad kehtivad tõendid, on ta seda jätkuvalt.

**Machine translation:**
As long as Newton's theory has been a truly scientific theory supported by the evidence in force, it will continue to be so.

**Reference translation:**
As far as Newton 's theory has been a truly scientific theory supported by valid evidence , it continues to be so .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Use of the phrase ""evidence in force"":** The phrase ""evidence in force"" is not used in the source text.
* **Use of the phrase ""continues to be so"":** The phrase ""continues to be so"" is not used in the source text.
* **Lack of Estonian idiom:** The machine translation does not include the Estonian idiom ""Niivõrd kui Newtoni teooria on olnud tõeliselt teaduslik teooria.""

**Reference translation:**
* **Use of the phrase ""valid evidence"":** The phrase ""valid evidence"" is used instead of ""evidence in force.""
* **Use of the phrase ""continues to be so"":** The phrase ""continues to be so"" is used in the same way as in the source text.
* **Inclusion of Estonian idiom:** The reference translation includes the Estonian idiom ""Niivõrd kui Newtoni teooria on olnud tõeliselt teaduslik teooria.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text. The use of different phrases and the lack of Estonian idiom make the translation sound less natural.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more faithful to the source text and includes the Estonian idiom. However, the use of the phrase ""valid evidence"" instead of ""evidence in force"" is a minor deviation from the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. It is more faithful to the source text and includes the Estonian idiom. However, the reference translation does not include the phrase ""evidence in force"" and uses the phrase ""valid evidence"" instead.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Machine translation:** After almost a week of recess, the group of OSCE observers was also present after the accident.

**Reference translation:** After almost a week of recess , the group of OSCE observers was also present at the accident site .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""accident"" while the reference translation uses ""accident site."" This is because the machine translation does not have the same context as the reference translation and therefore does not need to be as specific.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""group"" while the reference translation uses ""group of."" This is because the machine translation is not as precise as the reference translation and therefore does not need to specify the size of the group.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure. This is because the machine translation is not able to capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is not able to maintain the exact order of the words in the original text.
* **Grammatical errors:**
    * The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the wrong tense and the use of incorrect punctuation. This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the grammar of the original text as well as the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some errors. The main errors are the use of different word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The machine translation also has some grammatical errors. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it is not as accurate as the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**
In accordance with the provisions of an authorisation agreement , a broker has the obligation to release , the obligation to notify and the obligation of confidentiality .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

**Key differences:**

* **Subject:** The source text is about the obligations of a broker under an authorisation agreement, while the machine translation is about the obligations of the Commission under a settlement contract.
* **Verb tenses:** The source text uses the future tense ""on väljaandmisekohustus"" and ""hoidmise kohustus,"" while the machine translation uses the present tense ""has the obligation to issue"" and ""to maintain secrecy.""
* **Word choice:** The source text uses the word ""käsunduslepingu"" (authorization agreement), while the machine translation uses the word ""settlement contract.""

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

Elav sureb, ja nimelt lihtsalt sellepärast, et elav kui niisugune kannab endas surma seemet.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

Living is dying, and that is simply because living as such is a seed of death.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

What is living is dying , and that is simply because the living as such is carrying a seed of death .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""dying"" instead of ""carrying a seed of death."" This is a closer translation of the Estonian word ""sureb,"" but it does not capture the nuance of the phrase ""carrying a seed of death.""
    * The reference translation uses the word ""carrying a seed of death"" to emphasize the burden of living. This phrase is not an exact translation of the Estonian phrase, but it is a more accurate translation of the meaning.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure. This is a closer translation of the Estonian sentence structure, but it does not capture the rhythm and flow of the original text.
    * The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure. This is a more accurate translation of the original text, as it allows for a more nuanced and detailed expression of the ideas.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation follows the order of the Estonian sentence, but the reference translation rearranges the words to create a more natural flow in English.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the Estonian text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the original text, but it is also more verbose and less readable.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, I would recommend the reference translation as the best translation of the Estonian text into English. However, I would also note that the machine translation is a good alternative if you are looking for a more concise and readable translation.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation:**

**Source:** 1930. aastate lõpuni kirjutati seda nime inglise keeles enamasti Esthonia.

**Machine translation:** Until the end of the 1930s, this name was mostly written in English by Esthonia.

**Reference translation:** Until the end of the 1930s , this name was mostly written in English as Esthonia .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**Machine translation:**
* **Word choice:** ""Mostly written"" instead of ""was mostly written""
* **Word order:** Different sentence structure
* **Grammatical errors:** Incorrect verb tense (""was written"")
* **Lack of precision:** Does not specify the exact year or timeframe (""1930. aastate"")
* **Missing information:** Does not mention the connection between the name and Esthonia

**Reference translation:**
* **Word choice:** More precise and formal language (""as Esthonia"")
* **Word order:** More accurate sentence structure
* **Grammatical accuracy:** Correct verb tense and grammar
* **Precision:** Specifies the exact year and timeframe (""until the end of the 1930s"")
* **Completeness:** Mentions the connection between the name and Esthonia

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality:**

The machine translation is clearly not of high quality. It lacks precision, accuracy, and fluency. The language is also grammatically incorrect and does not flow well. The reference translation is much closer to the original text in terms of accuracy, precision, and grammar. However, the reference translation could be improved by being more concise and by using more precise language.

**Overall evaluation:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. The reference translation is much closer to the original text, but it could be improved.

**Additional notes:**

* The source text is in Estonian.
* The machine translation is generated by an online translation service.
* The reference translation is written by a human translator.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Mõlemad presidendid lubasid teha koostööd Iraani veenmisel tuumaprogrammist loobumiseks.

**Machine translation:** Both Presidents promised to work together to convince Iran to abandon the nuclear programme.

**Reference translation:** Both Presidents promised to work together to convince Iran to abandon the nuclear programme.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""convince"" instead of ""persuade"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""nuclear"" instead of ""atomic"" in the source text.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly to make it more concise and clear.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""to convince Iran"" to the end of the sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence to make it more logical and fluent.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""to abandon the nuclear programme"" to the end of the sentence.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation is more formal and neutral than the reference translation.
    * The machine translation does not use any colloquialisms or idiomatic expressions.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate and well-written, but there are some minor differences from the reference translation. The word choice and sentence structure are slightly different, but the meaning of the sentence is still clear. The machine translation is also more formal and neutral than the reference translation.

**Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved.**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Ja ta ei teinud ka kuigi palju, et näidata, miks inimesed oma tõelisi huvisid ei tunnista.

**Machine translation:** And he did not do very much to show why people do not recognise their real interests.

**Reference translation:** And he did not do very much to show why people do not recognise their real interests .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Main differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""show"" to convey the same meaning as ""demonstrate"" in the reference translation. This is a common substitution in machine translation, as the word ""show"" is more readily available in English than ""demonstrate.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""real"" to modify the word ""interests."" This is not the best usage of the word ""real,"" as it is not synonymous with ""true"" in this context.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise and easier to read. This is a common modification in machine translation, as it can make the translation more readable and fluent.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""why people do not recognise their real interests"" to the end of the sentence. This is not a natural placement for this phrase in English, as it is a dependent clause that should be closer to the subject of the sentence.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style than the source text and the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is trying to be more precise and accurate, which can sometimes lead to a more formal tone.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to read, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are the word choice, sentence structure, and style. These differences are not necessarily detrimental to the overall quality of the translation, but they could be improved.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** Kunagised vaated loodusele ei olnud vähem teaduslikud kui praegused.

**Machine translation:** Artistic views on nature were no less scientific than the current one.

**Reference translation:** The former views on nature were no less scientific than the current ones.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""artistic views"" instead of ""former views.""
- Uses the phrase ""no less scientific"" instead of ""no less scientific than the current ones.""
- Does not include the phrase ""loodusele"" (nature).
- Does not use the same word order as the source text.

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""former views"" to match the source text.
- Uses the same phrase as the source text: ""no less scientific than the current ones.""
- Includes the phrase ""loodusele.""
- Uses the same word order as the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text as well as the reference translation. The use of different phrases and the omission of certain words from the source text are notable differences. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is of high quality and captures the nuances of the source text very well. The use of the same phrase and word order as the source text is particularly impressive. However, the reference translation could be improved by using more vivid language and by avoiding the use of jargon.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is the more accurate and nuanced translation of the source text. However, the machine translation is a good translation that is generally accurate and easy to read.

**Machine translation:** The new viruses include viruses that have infected family crews for a relatively short time.

**Reference translation:** The new viruses include viruses that have infected host species for a relatively short period of time.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""family crews"" instead of ""host species."" This is not a precise translation, as ""family crews"" does not necessarily refer to the same group of organisms as ""host species.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text, making it more concise and less accurate.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of words in the sentence, making it less clear and less accurate.
* **Grammatical errors:**
    * The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the incorrect verb form ""infected.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the quality of the machine translation is poor. It is not accurate, as it does not faithfully translate the source text. It is also not well-structured, as it changes the sentence structure and word order of the source text. The machine translation also has some grammatical errors.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It is inaccurate, poorly structured, and has grammatical errors. The reference translation is a more accurate, well-structured, and grammatically correct translation of the source text.

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Kuigi kasvatus sisaldab vooruste kultiveerimist kasvatatavate juures, on vooruste kultiveerimisel iseenda juures upsakuse või enesepettuse maik man.

**Machine translation:** Although cultivation involves cultivating virtues at the bereaved level, the cult of virtues is a machine of drowning or self-deception to himself.

**Reference translation:** Although education involves cultivating virtues in those who are educated , the cultivation of virtues in oneself has a tinge of arrogance or self-deception to it .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""bereaved"" instead of ""educated"" in the second sentence. This word is not a perfect synonym for ""educated"" and does not capture the same meaning.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""machine"" instead of ""cult"" in the second sentence. This word is a more literal translation of the Estonian word ""masina"", but it does not capture the nuance of the word ""cult"" in this context.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""self-deception"" instead of ""arrogance"" in the second sentence. This word is a closer synonym for ""enesepettuse"", but it does not have the same negative connotation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text in the second sentence. The source text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""to himself"" to the end of the second sentence. This is not a natural English phrasing and it is not equivalent to the original text.
* **Overall tone:**
    * The machine translation has a more negative tone than the reference translation. The reference translation is more neutral and objective, while the machine translation is more critical and judgmental.

**Step 3: Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways. The main differences are in word choice, sentence structure, and overall tone. The machine translation is not a perfect translation of the source text and it does not capture the same meaning.

**Machine translation:** In 1936, the grass-roots disease spreading on local trees reached growth.

**Reference translation:** In 1936 , the root disease spreading on local trees reached the farms .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Preposition ""in"" vs. ""on"":** The machine translation uses ""in"" instead of ""on"" in the phrase ""reached growth."" This is a common error in machine translation, where the prepositions ""in"" and ""on"" are often interchangeable.
* **Word ""grass-roots"" vs. ""root"":** The machine translation uses the phrase ""grass-roots disease"" instead of ""root disease."" This is a mistranslation, as the original text uses the term ""root disease.""
* **Word ""farms"" vs. ""local trees"":** The machine translation uses the word ""farms"" instead of ""local trees."" This is a semantic error, as the original text is referring to the spreading disease on local trees, not the farms.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the original text, making it more concise and less accurate.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality due to several errors, including mistranslation, semantic errors, and grammatical errors. The use of incorrect prepositions, the use of the phrase ""grass-roots disease"" instead of ""root disease,"" and the change in sentence structure all contribute to the low quality of the translation.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is a short sentence in Estonian that describes the postponement of a new justice secretary's inauguration due to the Riigikogu election period. The text is clear and concise, but lacks some specific details that would be helpful for a translator.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation is accurate in terms of the main points of the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the Estonian language. For example, the machine translation does not use the term ""Riigikogu"" (Estonian Parliament), which is a specific term used in Estonia. Instead, the machine translation uses the term ""State"" which is not as precise.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the original text than the machine translation. It uses the term ""Riigikogu"" and also includes some additional details that are not in the source text, such as the specific date of the postponement.

**Step 4: Compare the translations:**

The machine translation is accurate but lacks precision and does not capture the nuances of the original text. The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the original text, but it also includes some additional details that are not in the source text.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved.

**Machine translation:** Hungary's paints also caused numerous small setbacks to the priests.

**Reference translation:** The Hungarian recruits also caused numerous small setbacks to the Prussians .

## Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation

**The machine translation:**

* **Changes the subject:** The source text talks about ""Ungari värvatud tekitasid"" (Hungarian recruits), while the machine translation changes the subject to ""Hungary's paints."" This is incorrect and does not capture the meaning of the original text.
* **Changes the verb:** The source text uses the verb ""väikeseid tagasilööke"" (caused numerous small setbacks), while the machine translation uses the verb ""caused."" This is also incorrect and does not capture the nuances of the original text.
* **Changes the object:** The source text talks about "" preislastele samuti"" (the Prussians), while the machine translation changes the object to ""the priests."" This is also incorrect and does not capture the meaning of the original text.
* **Changes the tone:** The original text is neutral, while the machine translation has a slightly negative tone. This is because the machine translation focuses on the negative aspects of the situation, such as the setbacks caused to the priests.

## Conclusion

The machine translation is not of good quality because it makes a number of changes to the original text that are not necessary. These changes change the meaning of the original text and make it difficult to understand.

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Teevad"" is translated as ""making"" instead of ""things"" which is more precise and closer to the original text.
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is slightly different, with the phrase ""erinevaid inimesi teevad"" being moved to the beginning of the sentence.
* **Word order:** The word order is different in some places, for example, ""erinevad asjad"" is translated as ""different things"" instead of ""things that are different"".
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation.
* **Formalness:** The machine translation is more formal than the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Erinevaid inimesi teevad"" is translated as ""different things make different happy"" which is more precise and closer to the original text.
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is similar to the original text.
* **Word order:** The word order is similar to the original text.
* **Conciseness:** The reference translation is slightly more concise than the original text.
* **Formalness:** The reference translation is similar to the original text in terms of formality.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the original text. The word choice is good, but the sentence structure is slightly different from the original text. The conciseness and formality of the machine translation are also good.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more accurate to the original text than the machine translation. The word choice and sentence structure are both similar to the original text. The conciseness and formality of the reference translation are also good.

**Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved.** The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the original text. The reference translation is more accurate to the original text, but it is slightly more verbose.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Lillede ja loomade nautimine on nii ilmselt hea, et inimesed, kes seda teevad, võivad isegi imestada, et sellel on midagi pistmist voorusega.

**Machine translation:** The enjoyment of chickens and animals is obviously so good that the people who do so may even be surprised that it has something to do with virtues.

**Reference translation:** The enjoyment of flowers and animals is obviously so good that the people who do so may even be surprised that it has something to do with virtues.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Subject:** The source text uses the subject "" Lillede ja loomade nautimine"" (enjoyment of flowers and animals), while the machine translation uses ""The enjoyment of chickens and animals."" This is a slight change in focus, as the source text emphasizes the enjoyment of flowers and animals in general, while the machine translation emphasizes the enjoyment of chickens and animals specifically.
* **Verb tense:** The source text uses the present tense (""on"") while the machine translation uses the future tense (""will be"") to describe the potential surprise of the people who enjoy flowers and animals.
* **Word choice:** The source text uses the word ""pistmist"" (something to do with) while the machine translation uses the word ""has something to do with."" This is a more precise translation, as the word ""pistmist"" is a more specific term in Estonian than the word ""has something to do with.""
* **Sentence structure:** The source text uses a complex sentence structure with a subordinate clause, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure. This is due to the limitations of machine translation, which often struggles with complex sentence structures.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The main differences are in the subject, verb tense, word choice, and sentence structure. These differences are not significant enough to make the translation unusable, but they do make it less accurate than the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The main differences are minor and do not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Kui ta seda viimast ei oleks, siis oleks tal teistsugune suhe praktikaga üldse.

**Machine translation:** If it did not have the latter, it would have a different relationship with practice at all.

**Reference translation:** If he was not the latter , he would have an entirely different relationship with practice .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Grammatical errors:** The sentence has several grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the word ""latter"" and the incorrect verb conjugation ""would have.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""relationship"" instead of the more precise word ""suhe"" in the source text.
* **Structure:** The sentence structure is different from the source text, with the use of a different clause structure and the rearrangement of the sentence elements.
* **Word order:** The word order is different from the source text, with the use of a different word order to convey the same meaning.

**Reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses the same word ""relationship"" as the machine translation, but it also uses the more precise word ""entirely"" to emphasize the difference between the two relationships.
* **Structure:** The sentence structure is similar to the source text, with the use of a similar clause structure and the preservation of the original sentence elements.
* **Word order:** The word order is similar to the source text, with the use of the same word order to convey the same meaning.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including grammatical errors, word choice, structure, and word order. While the machine translation is able to convey the general meaning of the source text, it does not do so with the same precision and accuracy as the reference translation.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation:**

**Source:** Julge oletuse kinnitamine toob kaasa taustteadmise mingi osa falsifitseerimise.

**Machine translation:** Approval of a flagrant assumption will lead to some kind of 'declassification' of the background.

**Reference translation:** Affirmation of a bold assumption results in falsification of certain part of background knowledge.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Lexical differences:**

* **""Julge oletuse kinnitamine""** is not directly translated in the reference translation. The closest equivalent is ""affirmation of a bold assumption.""
* **""Kaasa taustteadmise mingi osa falsifitseerimise""** is not translated in the reference translation. The closest equivalent is ""falsification of certain part of background knowledge.""

**2. Grammatical differences:**

* The machine translation uses the phrase ""will lead to"" to express the future tense, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""results in"" to express the same tense.
* The machine translation uses the phrase ""some kind of"" to express an unspecified quantity, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""certain part"" to express a specific quantity.

**3. Semantic differences:**

* The machine translation uses the word ""declassification"" which has a different meaning than the word ""falsification"" in this context.
* The reference translation is more precise in stating that the falsification of certain part of background knowledge is the result of affirming a bold assumption.

**Step 3: Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including lexical, grammatical, and semantic differences. While the machine translation is able to capture the general meaning of the source text, it does not capture the same level of precision and accuracy as the reference translation.

**Reference translation:** If fjords and other bays are not taken into account , the coastline is 2650 km or 2532 km .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""coastline"" instead of ""coast"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""others"" to include other bays, while the reference translation uses ""other bays.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a more concise sentence structure than the reference translation.
    * The machine translation does not use the phrase ""if fjords and other bays are not taken into account"" in the same way as the reference translation.
* **Word order:**

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** See ei ole kindlasti see, mida võrdsuse printsiibi all tavaliselt mõistetakse.

**Machine translation:** This is certainly not what is usually understood by the principle of equality.

**Reference translation:** This is certainly not what is usually understood as the principle of equality .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""This is certainly not what is usually understood"" is a different phrase than ""This is certainly not what is usually understood as the principle of equality."" The machine translation uses a more general phrase that does not specifically mention the principle of equality.
* **Syntax:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly from the source text. The source text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence. For example, the source text has the phrase ""tava liselt mõistetakse"" after the phrase ""See ei ole kindlasti see."" The machine translation has the phrase ""what is usually understood"" after the phrase ""This is certainly not.""
* **Style:** The machine translation has a more formal style than the source text and the reference translation. The source text is more conversational, while the machine translation is more formal and academic.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. However, the machine translation is still able to capture the meaning of the source text reasonably well. The translation is clear and concise, and it uses language that is appropriate for an English audience. However, the machine translation does not capture some of the nuances of the source text, such as the use of colloquial language and the use of idiomatic phrases. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it is not as accurate as the reference translation.

At home , Jaanus is again greeted by his grandmother , Alma , and when Jane arrives at home as well , they begin to quarrel .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""strain"" instead of ""tulli"" in the source text. ""Strain"" is not a perfect translation for ""tulli"" as it has a different meaning in English.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""at home"" twice, while the reference translation uses it only once. This is because the machine translation is trying to be more concise.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise.
    * The machine translation does not use the same verb tense as the source text. The source text uses the future tense, while the machine translation uses the present tense.
* **Meaning:**
    * The machine translation does not capture the same meaning as the source text. The source text is about a conflict between Jaanus and his grandmother. The machine translation is about the fact that Jaanus is greeted by his grandmother.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is different from the reference translation in many ways, including word choice, sentence structure, and meaning. The machine translation is also not very well-written. It is difficult to read and understand.

**Reference translation:**
The plan was opposed by local vassals who feared that the new landlord would curtail their extensive rights .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the term ""copies"" instead of ""vassals.""
* Does not specify the location of the rural Mr.
* Does not use the phrase ""seniseid laialdasi õigusi.""

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the term ""vassals"" instead of ""copies.""
* Specifies the location of the rural Mr. as ""new landlord.""
* Uses the phrase ""seniseid laialdasi õigusi.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text as well as the reference translation. The use of the term ""copies"" instead of ""vassals"" is a major deviation from the source text, and it is not clear who the rural Mr. is.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Ka kohalikke eetikaväiteid võib niimoodi vaadata; preskriptivism vaatabki asjale nii.

**Machine translation:** This is also how local ethics claims can be viewed; a more press sceptic looks at it.

**Reference translation:** This is also how local ethical claims can be viewed ; and this is how prescriptivism looks at it .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It combines the second and third sentences of the source into one sentence in the translation.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, ""preskriptivism"" is not used in the source text, and ""press sceptic"" is a more colloquial term than ""more skeptical.""
* **Syntax:** The machine translation has a different syntax than the source text. The source text uses a more formal structure, while the machine translation uses a more conversational structure.
* **Punctuation:** The machine translation uses different punctuation than the source text. For example, the source text uses a semicolon after ""eetikaväiteid,"" while the machine translation does not.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The conciseness and word choice are good, but the syntax and punctuation are not. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved.

**Step 4: Compare the quality of the machine translation to the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text than the machine translation. The reference translation captures the exact meaning of the source text, and it also uses the same syntax and punctuation as the source text. However, the reference translation is also more verbose than the machine translation. Overall, the reference translation is a better translation than the machine translation, but it is also more time-consuming and expensive to produce.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text**

The source text is a philosophical question in Estonian. It is asking whether there are any enjoyable mental states that we have an unfavourable attitude towards, regardless of their consequences.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it has some differences from the reference translation.

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""enjoyable"" instead of ""pleasing."" This is a good substitution, as the word ""enjoyable"" is more closely related to the word ""mental states"" than the word ""pleasing.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the source text. The source text uses a complex sentence structure, while the machine translation uses a simpler structure. This is probably because the machine translation is trying to be more concise and easier to read.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence. This is probably also to make the sentence more concise and easier to read.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation**

The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text than the machine translation. It uses the same word choice and sentence structure as the source text. However, the reference translation is a bit more verbose than the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it has some differences from the reference translation. The main differences are in word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text, but it is also more verbose.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Source:** Somaalia pealinnas Muqdishos Wehliye hotelli lähistel plahvatas autopomm.

**Machine translation:** A car bomb exploded near the Somali capital, Muqdishos Wehliye hotel.

**Reference translation:** A car bomb exploded near the Muqdishos Wehliye hotel in the Somali capital .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Lack of specificity:** The machine translation does not specify the location of the explosion ""near the Muqdishos Wehliye hotel,"" while the reference translation specifies the location as ""near the Muqdishos Wehliye hotel in the Somali capital.""
* **Missing modifier:** The machine translation does not include the modifier ""in the Somali capital,"" which is present in the reference translation.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""exploded,"" while the reference translation uses the more precise word ""plahvatas.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a simpler sentence structure, while the reference translation has a more complex structure.
* **Word order:** The machine translation follows a different word order than the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is generally accurate but lacks specificity and precision. It also has some issues with word choice, sentence structure, and word order. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved.

**Step 4: Compare the quality of the machine translation to the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more accurate and precise than the machine translation. It also uses more precise language and has a more complex sentence structure. However, the reference translation is also more verbose and may not be as easy to read as the machine translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good quality translation, but it lacks some specificity and precision. The reference translation is a more accurate and precise translation, but it is also more verbose. The best translation for a particular use case will depend on the specific needs of the user.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Machine translation:** These efforts remain within the framework of the same research programme.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

**Reference translation:** These efforts remain within the framework of the same research programme .

**4. Compare the machine translation to the reference translation:**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""these"" instead of ""the"" in the second sentence.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""framework"" instead of ""framework of"" in the second sentence.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""same"" instead of ""same"" in the second sentence.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the second sentence to a more complex one.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""within the framework of"" to the beginning of the second sentence.
    * The machine translation changes the verb tense of the second sentence to the present tense.
* **Word order:**

## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** 11. sajandil jäeti enamik senistest linnustest maha ja rajati uued, mis olid märksa suuremad ja tugevamini kindlustatud.

**Machine translation:** In the 11th century, most of the existing cities were left behind and new ones were built that were much bigger and more secure.

**Reference translation:** In the 11th century , most of the existing strongholds were left behind and new ones were built that were much bigger and more secure .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Strongholds vs. Cities:** The machine translation uses the word ""cities"" instead of ""strongholds,"" which is more accurate in the context of the source text. However, the word ""strongholds"" is more specific and conveys a sense of military strength, which is not present in the source text.
* **Overgeneralization:** The machine translation overgeneralizes the phrase ""senistest linnustest"" to ""existing cities."" The original text uses the phrase ""senistest linnustest"" to specify that the existing cities were left behind.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation lacks precision in the phrase ""uued, mis olid märksa suuremad ja tugevamini kindlustatud."" The original text specifies that the new cities were ""much bigger and more secure.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""bigger"" instead of ""much bigger."" The word ""much bigger"" is more precise and conveys a greater degree of difference between the size of the old and new cities.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does differ from the reference translation in a few ways. The main differences are the use of different words for ""strongholds"" and ""cities,"" overgeneralization, lack of precision, and word choice. These differences are not significant in most cases, but they could be improved in a more precise translation.

**Reference translation:** In total , he conducted more than 50 operas in Lyublyana in six months .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Gender:** The source text uses the feminine pronoun ""ta"" while the reference translation uses the masculine pronoun ""he."" This is due to the different gendered nature of the words ""operator"" and ""opera"" in Estonian and English respectively.
* **Verb tense:** The source text uses the past tense ""dirigereeris"" while the reference translation uses the past tense ""conducted."" This is because the source text is in the past tense, while the reference translation is in the past tense as well.
* **Word choice:** The source text uses the word ""operit"" while the reference translation uses the word ""operas."" This is due to the different connotations of the words in Estonian and English.
* **Word order:** The source text follows a different word order than the reference translation. The source text follows the order of subject, verb, object, modifier, while the reference translation follows the order of subject, verb, modifier, object. This is due to the different sentence structures in Estonian and English.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text well. However, there are some minor differences in grammar, word choice, and sentence structure that could be improved. Overall, the machine translation is a good quality translation, but it could be improved with some minor adjustments.

For example, the phrase ""namelt siis"" is a colloquial phrase that is not commonly used in English. The machine translation also replaces ""geštaldivahetusest"" with a more general term, ""exchange of views."" This is not necessarily a bad translation, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the original text.

Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved. The reference translation is a more accurate translation, but it is also more verbose and less readable.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Slovjanski venemeelsete separatistide rühmitus kinnitas, et vaatlejad on nende juures.

**Machine translation:** Slovjanski, a group of pro-Russian separatists, confirmed that they have observers.

**Reference translation:** A group of pro-Russian separatists in Slovyansk confirmed that they have the observers.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation, removing the phrase ""in Slovyansk.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""separatists"" instead of ""pro-Russian separatists.""
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the word order of the sentence, moving the phrase ""confirmed that they have observers"" to the end.
* **Syntax:** The machine translation uses a different syntax than the reference translation, using a more active voice.

**Reference translation:**
* **Precision:** The reference translation is more precise, specifying the location of the separatists (""Slovyansk"") and the observers (""the observers"").
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses the word ""pro-Russian separatists"" to be more specific.
* **Word order:** The reference translation follows a more logical order, with the subject, verb, and object in the correct sequence.
* **Syntax:** The reference translation uses a more formal syntax than the machine translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation. The conciseness and word choice are acceptable, but the word order and syntax are not.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good approximation of the source text, but it does not match the quality of the reference translation. The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are the lack of precision, the different word choice, and the altered syntax.

**Machine translation:** By July, half Estonia was under the control of German troops.

**Reference translation:** By July , half of Estonia was under the control of German troops .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation, removing the phrase ""pool"" and using the phrase ""under the control of"" instead of ""was under the control of.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""control"" instead of ""command"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation, moving the phrase ""by July"" to the beginning of the sentence.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words ""half"" and ""Estonia"" compared to the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**

* **Precision:** The reference translation is more precise than the machine translation, specifying the exact time of ""July"" and using the phrase ""was under the control of"" to emphasize the control of Estonian territory.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses the word ""command"" instead of ""control"" to convey a sense of authority.
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the machine translation, with the phrase ""by July"" being used to introduce a subordinate clause.

**1. Read the source:**

Aastal 1914 okupeeris Nauru Austraalia Ekspeditsioonijõud.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

In 1914 Nauru occupied the Equatorial Forces of Australia.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

In 1914 Nauru occupied the Expedition Forces of Australia .

**4. Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""Equatorial"" instead of ""Expedition"" in the second sentence. This is not a precise translation, as the original text uses the word ""Ekspeditsioonijõud"" which specifically refers to the expedition forces, not the equatorial forces.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""occupied"" instead of ""okupeeris"". This is a more literal translation, but it does not capture the nuance of the original text, which is more forceful and emphasizes the act of occupation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation restructures the second sentence to be more concise. This changes the flow of the sentence and does not match the original text.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the original text. This can be confusing for the reader.
* **Grammatical errors:**
    * The machine translation has a grammatical error in the second sentence: ""In 1914 Nauru occupied the Equatorial Forces of Australia."" The correct sentence should be ""In 1914 Nauru occupied the Expedition Forces of Australia.""

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not a good quality translation. It has made a number of errors in word choice, sentence structure, and grammar. The reference translation is a much better quality translation. It is more accurate, concise, and well-structured.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text**

The source text is a concise and formal sentence in Estonian. It uses specific terminology related to human origins and evolution (""päritolu uurimiseks,"" ""eripära,"" ""evolutsiooniprotsesse""). The sentence also employs a complex verb ""kutsusid"" which is not commonly used in everyday English.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and conveys the main idea of the source text. However, it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""explain this human specificity"" is a good translation of the Estonian phrase ""eripära selgitada,"" but the phrase ""describe the evolutionary processes"" is not a perfect equivalent for ""evolutsiooniprotsesse kirjeldada."" The reference translation is more precise and uses more specific terminology related to human evolution (""evolutionary processes"") than the machine translation.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation**

The reference translation is well-written and accurate. It uses clear and concise language, and the terminology is appropriate for the topic. The sentence structure is also well-crafted, and the use of active voice is effective in conveying the sense of purpose and action.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for translating the source text, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation. The reference translation is the more accurate and well-written translation, as it uses more specific terminology related to human evolution and employs a more nuanced sentence structure.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not use the same specific terminology as the reference translation, such as ""evolutionary processes"" instead of ""evolutsiooniprotsesse.""
* **Lack of clarity:** The machine translation is not as clear as the reference translation, and it can be difficult to understand some of the phrases.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the incorrect verb form ""explain.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation does not use the same sentence structure as the reference translation, and it can be difficult to read and understand.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** Meil on muidugi tähtis aru saada, mida moraaliprintsiibid nõuavad, toetavad ja keelavad.

**Machine translation:** It is, of course, important for us to understand what moral principles require, support and ban.

**Reference translation:** It is , of course , important for us to understand what is requireed , supported and prohibited by moral principles .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Grammatical errors:** The sentence structure is incorrect, with errors in verb conjugation and syntax.
* **Word choice:** The words ""require"" and ""ban"" are not exact translations of the Estonian words ""tingib"" and "" keel"" respectively.
* **Lack of precision:** The translation does not specify what moral principles are being referred to.
* **Lack of clarity:** The sentence is not clear and concise, and the use of jargon (e.g., ""moraaliprintsiibid"") makes it difficult to understand.

**Reference translation:**

* **Grammatical accuracy:** The sentence structure is correct, with no errors in verb conjugation or syntax.
* **Word choice:** The words ""require"" and ""prohibit"" are exact translations of the Estonian words ""tingib"" and "" keel"" respectively.
* **Precision:** The translation specifies the moral principles that are being referred to.
* **Clarity:** The sentence is clear and concise, and the use of simple language makes it easy to understand.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. It is more grammatically accurate, has a more precise and clear meaning, and uses more appropriate word choice. The machine translation has a number of errors, including grammatical errors, lack of precision, and lack of clarity.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Lõpuüritusel osales teiste seas ka Suurbritannia peaminister Tony Blair.

**Machine translation:** The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, also took part in the final event.

**Reference translation:** British Prime Minister , Tony Blair , also took part in the final event .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""Prime Minister"" while the reference translation uses ""Prime  Minister, Tony Blair."" This is because the machine translation does not have access to the name of the Prime Minister and therefore uses a more generic term.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""final event"" while the reference translation uses ""final event."" This is because the machine translation does not have access to the specific context of the text and therefore uses a more general term.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more concise sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure. This is because the machine translation is trying to be as concise as possible, while the reference translation is trying to be as accurate as possible.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is trying to find the best order for the words in the sentence that will result in the most accurate translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is not of the same quality as the reference translation. The machine translation is accurate in some respects, but it is not always able to capture the nuances of the original text. The machine translation also makes some errors in word choice and sentence structure.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good starting point for a translation, but it would not be a suitable final translation.**

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Sellisele skeptitsismile ei saa läheneda samamoodi nagu välismaailmaskeptitsismile.

**Machine translation:** Such scepticism cannot be approached in the same way as that of globalisation.

**Reference translation:** Such scepticism cannot be approached in the same way as the scepticism of the external world .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Focus:** The machine translation focuses on the similarity of the phrase ""skepticism"" to the word ""globalisation"". It does not capture the nuance of the source text, which is about the impossibility of approaching scepticism in the same way as the scepticism of the external world.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""globalisation"" instead of ""external world"". This is a lexical error, as ""globalisation"" is not synonymous with ""external world"".
* **Syntax:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to a more complex one. This is not necessary, as the original sentence is clear and concise.
* **Meaning:** The machine translation does not capture the meaning of the source text accurately. It is not possible to approach scepticism in the same way as the scepticism of the external world.

**Reference translation:**

* **Focus:** The reference translation focuses on the similarity of the phrase ""skepticism"" to the phrase ""scepticism of the external world"". It also captures the nuance of the source text.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses the word ""external world"" instead of ""globalisation"". This is a more accurate translation, as ""external world"" is more synonymous with ""skepticism of the external world"".
* **Syntax:** The reference translation preserves the sentence structure of the source text. This is important, as the original sentence is clear and concise.
* **Meaning:** The reference translation captures the meaning of the source text accurately. It is not possible to approach scepticism in the same way as the scepticism of the external world.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It has a number of errors, including lexical errors, syntax errors, and errors in meaning. The reference translation is of much higher quality. It is more accurate, concise, and well-structured.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** See, et need ei tekita praegu motivatsiooni, ei tähenda, et neil poleks tugevat normatiivset jõudu.

**Machine translation:** The fact that they do not currently create motivation does not mean that they do not have a strong normative force.

**Reference translation:** The fact that they do not currently create motivation does not mean that they do not have a strong normative force .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""force"" instead of ""influence"" in the reference translation. This is a semantic difference, as ""force"" is a more literal term, while ""influence"" is a more figurative term.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text, making it more complex and verbose.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the word order of the source text, making it more logical and fluent.
* **Syntax:** The machine translation uses different syntax than the source text, making it more difficult to read and understand.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The use of different words and sentence structures, as well as the changed word order, all contribute to the difference between the machine translation and the reference translation.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it does not match the quality of the reference translation.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:**
Rõivaste värvid on kirkad, samas 14. sajandi freskod on Palaiologoste perioodi klassikalises stiilis.

**Machine translation:**
Clothing colours are surgical, while the 14th century shelf dogs are in the classic style of the Palaiologisation period.

**Reference translation:**
Clothing colours are bright, while the 14th century frescos are in the classic style of the Palaiologos period.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Surgical** instead of **bright** for the adjective ""värvid"".
* **Shelf dogs** instead of **freskod** for the noun ""freskod"".
* **Palaiologisation** instead of **Palaiologoste** for the noun ""perioodi"".
* **Classic style** instead of **classic style** for the phrase ""klassikalises stiilis"".

**Reference translation:**
* **Bright** instead of **Surgical** for the adjective ""värvid"".
* **Freskod** instead of **Shelf dogs** for the noun ""freskod"".
* **Palaiologoste** instead of **Palaiologisation** for the noun ""perioodi"".
* **Classic style** instead of **Classic style** for the phrase ""klassikalises stiilis"".

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The use of surgical instead of bright for the adjective ""värvid"" is a poor choice, as it does not match the tone of the text. The use of shelf dogs instead of frescos is also a poor choice, as it is not a suitable synonym for the word ""freskod"".

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is well-written and captures the nuances of the original text. The use of bright instead of surgical for the adjective ""värvid"" is a much better choice, as it matches the tone of the text. The use of frescos instead of shelf dogs is also a better choice, as it is a more suitable synonym for the word ""freskod"".

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, captures the nuances of the original text more closely, and is more readable.

## Quality Evaluation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Aga kõik niisugused edasised ja konkreetsemad määratlused ei jäta olemist enam puhtaks olemiseks, nagu ta alguses vahetult on.

**Machine translation:** However, not all such further and more specific definitions leave it out of existence any longer, as it is at the very beginning.

**Reference translation:** However , any such further and more specific definitions do not leave being any longer the pure being , as it is at the very beginning .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** Uses the word ""leave"" instead of ""does not leave"" to convey the same meaning as the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:** Changes the sentence structure slightly to fit the English language, using a different word order and sentence length.
* **Word meaning:** Uses the word ""pure"" in a slightly different way than the reference translation, focusing more on the abstract concept of purity rather than the physical state of being pure.
* **Conciseness:** Is more concise than the reference translation, removing some of the unnecessary phrases.

**Reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** Uses the word ""does not leave"" to convey the same meaning as the source text more accurately.
* **Sentence structure:** Maintains the original sentence structure and length.
* **Word meaning:** Uses the word ""pure"" in a more precise way, referring to the state of being pure rather than the abstract concept of purity.
* **Additional details:** Includes additional details that are not in the source text, such as the phrase ""as it is at the very beginning.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and captures the meaning of the source text well. However, it does make some minor changes to the original text, such as the word choice and sentence structure. These changes are not significant enough to alter the overall meaning of the text, but they could be improved upon.

**Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more faithful to the original text than the machine translation. It uses the same word choice and sentence structure as the source text, and it also includes all of the details that are in the source text. However, the reference translation is slightly more verbose than the source text, and it could be improved by being more concise.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the machine translation and reference translation are both well-written translations of the source text. The machine translation is more concise and easier to read, but it does not include some of the details that are in the source text. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text, but it is also more verbose and difficult to read.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

* The source text is a simple sentence with the following information: date, location, person, and title.
* The sentence is grammatically correct and concise.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

* The machine translation accurately captures the main information of the source text, but the wording is slightly different.
* The phrase ""of 23 February 2013"" is a common phrase in English, but it is not the best phrasing in this sentence. A more precise phrase, such as ""on 23 February 2013,"" would be more accurate.
* The phrase ""Italian President Giorgio Napolitano"" is translated correctly, but the use of the term ""Italian"" is unnecessary. The phrase ""President Giorgio Napolitano"" would be more concise and accurate.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

* The reference translation is grammatically correct and concise, and it uses the same wording as the source text.
* The phrase ""on 23 February 2013"" is used in the reference translation, which is more precise than the phrase ""of 23 February 2013"" used in the machine translation.
* The phrase ""President Giorgio Napolitano"" is translated correctly in the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is accurate, but the wording is slightly different from the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and concise, and it uses the same wording as the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation**

**Source:** Eetilise väärtuse säilitamine seisneb eetiliste dispositsioonide taastootmises.

**Machine translation:** Maintaining an ethical value lies in the reproduction of ethical positions.

**Reference translation:** Maintaining ethical value lies in the reproduction of ethical dispositions.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

The machine translation differs from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Terminology:** The machine translation uses the term ""positions"" instead of ""dispositions."" This is because the machine translator is not able to find the exact equivalent of the Estonian term ""väärtuse säilitamine"" in English.
* **Structure:** The machine translation has a more formal structure than the reference translation. This is because the machine translator is trying to preserve the structure of the original text as much as possible.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses more abstract words, such as ""positions"" and ""reproduction."" This is because the machine translator is trying to find words that are equivalent to the original text in meaning and formality.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation**

The quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved. The translation is accurate and conveys the meaning of the original text well. However, the translation is not as fluent or idiomatic as the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the original text, but it could be improved. The main areas where the translation could be improved are the use of terminology, structure, and word choice.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is short and concise, but it uses some idiomatic expressions and specific terminology related to warfare (""sõjalaevade uputamiseks"").

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to understand, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""wrecks"" instead of ""rockets"" is a clear deviation from the source text and the reference translation.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is very similar to the source text, using the same phrasing and terminology. It is also grammatically correct and easy to understand.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""wrecks"" instead of ""rockets,"" which is not a precise equivalent in this context.
* **Phrasing:** The machine translation does not use the same phrasing as the source text or the reference translation.
* **Syntax:** The machine translation does not use the same sentence structure as the source text or the reference translation.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good attempt to translate the source text, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation. The use of the wrong word ""wrecks"" and the different phrasing and syntax are the main areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation.

**Recommendations:**

To improve the quality of the machine translation, the following steps could be taken:

* Use a more precise word equivalent for ""rockets"" in the context of the source text.
* Use the same phrasing and syntax as the source text and the reference translation.
* Improve the overall grammar and syntax of the translation.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Eriti visalt nõudsid seda suurtükiväe ülemad, sest muda kippus nende liikumist päris tõsiselt takistama.

**Machine translation:** This artillery, in particular, was persistently demanded by the superiors of the artillery, because the sludge was quite serious in blocking their movement.

**Reference translation:** The commanders of the artillery demanded this especially , because the sludge tended to hinder their movement quite seriously .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Main differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""artillery"" instead of ""commandsers of the artillery."" This is a more neutral term and does not convey the same sense of authority as the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""seriously"" instead of ""quite seriously."" This is a more informal term and does not convey the same sense of severity as the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure with a lot of participial phrases. The reference translation uses a simpler sentence structure with more concise phrasing.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation. The machine translation follows a subject-verb-object order, while the reference translation follows a subject-object-verb order.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are the word choice and sentence structure. The machine translation uses more neutral and informal language than the reference translation. The machine translation also uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. These differences make the machine translation less accurate and less faithful to the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""criminal"" instead of ""banker."" This is a semantic error, as the original text refers to a banker, not a criminal.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""snuisance"" instead of ""German."" This is a mistranslation, as the word ""snuisance"" does not exist in the English language.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""United Kingdom"" instead of ""Great Britain."" This is a stylistic error, as the original text uses ""Great Britain.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the original text. The original text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses two sentences.
    * The machine translation moves the modifier ""in London"" to the end of the sentence. This is a stylistic error, as the modifier should be placed after the noun it modifies.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence. The original text has the order ""Suurbritannias Londonis tehti mõrvakatse Venemaa ekspankurile German Gorbuntsovile."" The machine translation has the order ""In the United Kingdom in London, a murder attempt was made against the Russian exiled criminal.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is of poor quality. It has several errors in word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The errors are significant and would make it difficult for a reader to understand the original text.

- Uses the correct verb ""became"" in the sense of achieving a title.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The use of incorrect terminology and the omission of important details make the translation inferior to the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is different from the reference translation in several ways, including the use of incorrect terminology, the omission of important details, and the use of incorrect grammar. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the original text.

**Machine translation:**
Mathematics have also developed tools for hydrodynamics and theory for language learning, for example.

**Reference translation:**
Mathematicians have also developed tools , for instance , for the theories of hydrodynamics and language vibration .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Grammatical errors:** The sentence structure is incorrect in several places, such as the use of the verb ""develop"" in the wrong tense and the incorrect placement of the phrase ""for example.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""tools"" instead of ""instruments"" and ""theory for language learning"" instead of ""theories of language vibration.""
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the theories of hydrodynamics and language vibration, while the reference translation does.
* **Lack of fluency:** The machine translation is not as fluent as the reference translation, and it does not read as naturally.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It has a number of grammatical errors, word choice problems, and lacks precision and fluency. The reference translation is much more accurate and fluent, and it more closely follows the original text.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

Olukord oli keeruline ka taanlastele, kes samuti kaotasid suurema osa oma Eestimaa valdustest.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The situation was also difficult for the Danes, who also lost most of the holdings in Estonia.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The situation was also difficult for the Danes , who also lost most of their holdings in Estonia .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""Danes"" instead of ""Danish"" in the reference translation. This is an error, as the text is about Estonia, not Denmark.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""holdings"" instead of ""possessions"" in the reference translation. This is a semantic error, as ""holdings"" is not the best translation of ""valdustest"" in this context.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to a more complex structure. This is not necessary, as the original text is clear and concise.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""who also lost most of their holdings"" to the end of the sentence. This is not an improvement, as it makes the sentence more difficult to read.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence. This is not necessary, as the original text is well-structured.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It has made a number of errors in word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The reference translation is much closer to the original text in terms of accuracy and fluency.

## Quality Evaluation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Luksemburgis algas Euroopa Liidu välisministrite kahepäevane kohtumine, millel osales ka Eesti välisminister Marina Kaljurand.

**Machine translation:** In Luxembourg a two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers began, including the Estonian Foreign Minister Marina Kaljurand.

**Reference translation:** In Luxembourg a two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers began , which was also attended by Estonian Foreign Minister Marina Kaljurand .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Omission:** The phrase ""which was also attended by"" is omitted.
* **Word choice:** The word ""began"" is used instead of ""started"" in the reference translation.
* **Syntax:** The sentence structure is different, with the phrase ""including the Estonian Foreign Minister Marina Kaljurand"" being moved to the end.
* **Word order:** The order of the words ""two-day"" and ""meeting"" is reversed.
* **Punctuation:** The sentence lacks a comma after ""ministers began.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the impact of the differences.**

The differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are minor and do not significantly impact the meaning of the text. However, the omission of the phrase ""which was also attended by"" is notable, as it provides additional context to the meeting. The use of the word ""began"" instead of ""started"" is also a minor difference, but it is important in maintaining the flow of the sentence. The other differences are primarily stylistic and do not affect the meaning of the text.

**Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by including the phrase ""which was also attended by"" and by using more precise wording.**

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Samal ajal aga võib ta teda kui moraalse ürituse vastast väga austada.

**Machine translation:** At the same time, however, he can very much respect him as a moral cause.

**Reference translation:** At the same time , however , he can very much respect him as an opponent to the moral cause .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""cause"" instead of ""cause"" in the reference translation. This is a semantic error, as the word ""cause"" in the machine translation does not have the same meaning as the word ""opponent"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""austada"" instead of ""vastast"" in the source text. This is a lexical error, as the word ""austada"" does not exist in English.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise. This is a stylistic error, as the sentence structure in the source text is more complex and nuanced than the sentence structure in the machine translation.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""as a moral cause"" to the end of the sentence. This is a syntactic error, as the phrase ""as a moral cause"" is not in the correct position in the sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It has a number of errors, including semantic errors, lexical errors, stylistic errors and syntactic errors. The translation is also not very faithful to the original text. It changes the sentence structure and word choice of the source text in a way that makes it difficult to understand.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a good translation of the source text. It has a number of errors and is not very faithful to the original text.

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Ilovaiskis jätkuvad lahingud, tänavalahingud ja käsitsivõitlus valitsusvägede ja okupantide vahel.

**Machine translation:** In Ilovak, the fighting, the street rivalry and the fight between government forces and the documents continue.

**Reference translation:** In Ilovaisk , the fighting , the street battles and hand combat between government forces and the occupants continue .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""documents"" instead of ""occupants"" in the reference translation. This is a semantic error, as the documents are not necessarily related to the fighting or the occupants.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""in Ilovak"" instead of ""in Ilovaisk"" in the reference translation. This is a phrase error, as the phrase ""in Ilovak"" is not correct.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with a compound predicate. The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a more concise predicate.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation. The reference translation follows the subject-verb-object order, while the machine translation follows the subject-object-verb order.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style than the reference translation. The reference translation is more conversational and concise.
    * The machine translation does not use the same register of formality as the reference translation. The reference translation is more formal and official, while the machine translation is more casual and conversational.

**Source:** Vihkaja tahab olla ilusam teistest ilusatest, olla kõrgem elusast ja tervest.

**Machine translation:** The virus wants to be more beautiful than other pieces of beauty, higher than living and healthy.

**Reference translation:** The hater wants to be more beautiful than other beauties , higher than all living and healthy .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* The use of the word ""pieces"" instead of ""other beauties"" to describe the objects of comparison.
* The use of the word ""higher"" instead of ""above"" to describe the desired position.
* The omission of the word ""hater"" in the first sentence.
* The use of the word ""virus"" instead of a more specific term for the hater.

**Reference translation:**
* The use of the word ""other beauties"" to describe the objects of comparison.
* The use of the word ""above"" to describe the desired position.
* The inclusion of the word ""hater"" in the first sentence.
* The use of a more specific term for the hater, such as ""malice"" or ""wickedness"".

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The use of different words and phrases to describe the same concepts can lead to a different meaning or interpretation. The omission of the word ""hater"" in the first sentence is also a significant difference, as it changes the focus of the text from the hater's desire to be beautiful to the hater's desire to be superior to others.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good approximation of the original text, but it does not capture all of the nuances and precision of the reference translation. The use of different words and phrases, as well as the omission of key words, can lead to a different meaning or interpretation.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:**
Oluliseks kohustuseks makseteenuse pakkuja ja maksevahendaja vahel on saladuse hoidmise kohustus, mis kehtib lepingu ajal, samuti selle lõppedes.

**Machine translation:**
An important obligation between the payment service provider and the payment mediator is the obligation to maintain secrecy, which applies during the contract, as well as at the end of it.

**Reference translation:**
An important obligation between the payment service provider and the payment mediator is the obligation to maintain secrecy , which applies during the contract , as well as after its expiry .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Missing modifier:**
The reference translation uses the modifier ""after its expiry"" to clarify the scope of the obligation. The machine translation does not include this modifier.

**2. Different verb tense:**
The reference translation uses the future tense ""kehtib"" to describe the obligation that applies during the contract. The machine translation uses the present tense ""apply"" instead.

**3. Different word choice:**
The reference translation uses the word ""secrecy"" to describe the obligation. The machine translation uses the word ""confidentiality"" instead.

**4. Lack of precision:**
The machine translation does not specify the scope of the obligation as clearly as the reference translation. It is not clear whether the obligation applies to all aspects of the contract or only to certain specific ones.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation:**

The machine translation is generally accurate and conveys the main idea of the source text. However, it lacks some of the precision and clarity of the reference translation. The missing modifier, different verb tense, and different word choice all contribute to the overall impression that the machine translation is not as high-quality as the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for an Estonian-English translation, but it could be improved. The main issues with the machine translation are the lack of precision and the different word choice. The reference translation is a better example of a high-quality translation, as it is more accurate, clear and concise.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

The text is in Estonian and describes the falsification of scientific laws and theories. It states that a good scientific law or theory is falsifiable because it makes a statement about the world.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is in English and accurately translates the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The main difference is that the machine translation uses the phrase ""punishable"" instead of ""falsifiable."" Punishable is not a synonym of falsifiable in this context.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate translation of the source text than the machine translation. It uses the term ""falsifiable"" instead of ""punishable,"" which is the correct term in this context.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""punishable"" instead of ""falsifiable."" Punishable is not a synonym of falsifiable in this context.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the original text to make it more concise.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the incorrect verb form ""claims"" instead of ""states.""

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. The main difference is the use of the word ""punishable"" instead of ""falsifiable.""
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Reference translation:** Two soldiers were injured and brought to Tskhinvali hospital for treatment.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""soldiers"" instead of ""sõdurit"" in the source text. This is a common translation error, as the word ""soldiers"" is not an exact equivalent of ""sõdurit"" in Estonian.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""hospital"" instead of ""haiglasse"" in the source text. This is also a common translation error, as the word ""hospital"" is not an exact equivalent of ""haiglasse"" in Estonian.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

Neither did he like the features of the human race being generalised.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

Neither did he like the fact that character traits of the human race were generalised.

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is similar to the reference translation in that it correctly identifies the main idea of the source text, which is that character traits of the human race are being generalised. However, the machine translation uses the phrase ""features of the human race"" which is not as precise as the phrase ""character traits of the human race"" used in the reference translation. The phrase ""features of the human race"" is more general and does not specify which character traits are being referred to, while the phrase ""character traits of the human race"" is more specific and lists some of the character traits that are being generalised.

The machine translation also uses the phrase ""being generalised"" which is not present in the source text. This phrase is used to emphasize the fact that the character traits are being generalised, but it is not necessary in this context.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it could be improved by being more precise and by removing unnecessary phrases.

**Machine translation:** And, as was the case, it is sometimes important in private life that what is accused is protected by someone.

**Reference translation:** And , as in a court , it is sometimes important in private life that the one who is accused is defended by someone .

**Step 2: Identifying differences between the machine translation and the reference translation**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation, removing the phrase ""as in a court"" and replacing it with ""as was the case.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""protect"" instead of ""defend,"" which is more closely aligned with the source text.
* **Syntax:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, moving the phrase ""that what is accused is protected"" to the end of the sentence.

**Reference translation:**

* **Formalness:** The reference translation is more formal than the source text and the machine translation, using the phrase ""as in a court"" to emphasize the seriousness of the situation.
* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses the word ""defend"" instead of ""protect,"" which is more accurate in this context.
* **Syntax:** The reference translation closely follows the syntax of the source text, maintaining the original sentence structure.

**Step 3: Evaluation**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks the formality and precision of the reference translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text, but it is also more verbose and less concise.

**Overall:**

The quality of the Estonian-English translation depends on the specific needs of the user. If conciseness and accuracy are the main priorities, the machine translation may be more suitable. If formality and precision are more important, the reference translation may be more appropriate.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation:**

**Source:** Naftat tarbiti 2004. aastal umbes 1000 barrelit päevas.

**Machine translation:** Around 1 000 barrels were consumed a day in 2004.

**Reference translation:** Around 1 000 barrels of oil were consumed per day in 2004.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Missing modifier:**

- The reference translation uses the modifier ""of oil"" to specify that the oil consumption is of oil. The machine translation does not have this modifier.

**2. Different verb tense:**

- The reference translation uses the past tense ""were consumed"" to describe the oil consumption in the past. The machine translation uses the present tense ""are consumed"" to describe the oil consumption in the future.

**3. Different phrasing:**

- The reference translation uses the phrase ""around 1 000 barrels"" to specify the exact number of barrels. The machine translation uses the phrase ""around 1 000 barrels were consumed"" to be more precise and include the consumption aspect.

**4. Lack of specificity:**

- The reference translation specifies the consumption of ""oil"" and mentions the year ""2004"". The machine translation does not specify the type of oil or the year.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality:**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and conveys the main idea of the source text. However, it lacks the specificity and precision of the reference translation. The missing modifier ""of oil"", the different verb tense, and the lack of specificity all contribute to the lower quality of the machine translation.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for translating the source text, but it could be improved by adding more details and using more precise phrasing. The reference translation is the more accurate and high-quality translation.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

Allan has a meeting with Jaak to discuss the affairs of the sewing plant.

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""come together"" instead of ""have a meeting"" in the reference translation. This is a common mistake made by machine translation, as the word ""come together"" is often used in a more casual sense than ""have a meeting.""
    * The machine translation also uses the word ""heating plant"" instead of ""sewing plant."" This is because the machine translation does not have access to the context of the text, and therefore cannot determine the correct word to use.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure. This is because the machine translation is not able to capture the nuances of the original text.
    * The machine translation also omits the phrase ""et arutada"" from the original text. This is because the machine translation does not need to include this phrase, as it is not essential to the meaning of the text.

* **Misplacement of modifiers:** ""At the fringes of the neck"" is not the best placement for the modifier ""at the fringes of the neck.""
* **Use of inappropriate vocabulary:** ""Wind"" is not an appropriate synonym for ""diver"" in this context.

**Reference translation:**
* **Use of formal language:** ""The near vertical tunnel sections"" is a formal phrase that is more appropriate for use in writing.
* **Accurate verb conjugation:** ""Could also have collapsed"" is an accurate translation of the verb ""võisid.""
* **Logical placement of modifiers:** ""At the sides of the hull"" is the best placement for the modifier ""at the sides of the hull.""
* **Use of appropriate vocabulary:** ""Diver"" is the most appropriate synonym for ""diver"" in this context.

**Reference translation:** Are needs to decide what to do with Raim who is trying to find his way back into her life and has now moved to live near Morna .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Main differences:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It uses fewer words to convey the same meaning.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, the machine translation uses the word ""however"" instead of ""are needs"" and the word ""which"" instead of ""who.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a compound sentence, while the reference translation uses a complex sentence.
* **Focus:** The machine translation focuses more on the necessity of deciding what to do, while the reference translation focuses more on the need to decide what to do.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The conciseness and the different word choice make the translation difficult to understand. The different sentence structure also makes the translation difficult to read. Overall, the machine translation is not of high quality.

**Step 4: Compare the quality of the machine translation to the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is of much higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, more concise, and more readable. The reference translation also captures the exact meaning of the source text. Overall, the reference translation is the best translation of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Reference Translation:**
At the meeting , Raivo Aeg exchanged experience with colleagues on curbing the April unrest and discussed cooperation in the implementation of the Schengen Agreement .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine Translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation, removing the phrase ""samuti arutati"" and simplifying the sentence structure.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""time"" instead of ""experience"" and ""curbing"" instead of ""suppressing.""
* **Syntax:** The machine translation has a different syntax than the reference translation, with the phrase ""as well as cooperation"" being moved to the end of the sentence.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence compared to the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and conveys the meaning of the source text accurately. However, it does differ from the reference translation in a number of ways. The conciseness and different word choice make the machine translation slightly less clear than the reference translation. The different syntax and word order also make the machine translation sound slightly different from the reference translation.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not match the quality of the reference translation.**

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

> Stanisław August Poniatowski, viimane Poola kuningas, oli vastuoluline kuju.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

> Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last King of Poland, was a controversial figure.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

> Stanisław August Poniatowski , the last King of Poland , was a controversial figure .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Thematic shift:** The source text focuses primarily on the controversial nature of the figure of King Poniatowski, while the machine translation shifts the focus to his title of ""last King of Poland.""
* **Word choice:** The source text uses the word ""viimane"" (last) to emphasize the finality of the king's reign, while the machine translation uses the word ""last"" in a more general sense.
* **Sentence structure:** The source text uses a complex sentence structure with a compound predicate, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a more direct structure.
* **Word order:** The source text follows a different word order than the machine translation.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the word ""Poland"" and the incorrect use of the word ""king.""

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main ideas of the source text, but it does not preserve the same level of precision and accuracy. The thematic shift and the use of different words and sentence structures are the most significant differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation:**

**Source:** Nii et selline mõju ei saa mõjutada ratsionaalse utilitaristi hinnangut, kas tegu on õige.

**Machine translation:** So such an impact cannot be influenced by an assessment of rational utilities infrastructure, whether it is right.

**Reference translation:** So such an impact cannot influence the judgement of a rational utilitarian about whether the act is right.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Word choice:**
- The machine translation uses the word ""utilities"" instead of ""utilitarian"" in the second sentence. This is a semantic error, as ""utilities"" is not synonymous with ""utilitarian.""
- The machine translation uses the word ""infrastructure"" instead of ""judgement."" This is also a semantic error, as ""infrastructure"" is not related to ""judgement.""

**2. Sentence structure:**
- The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text, making it more complex and less clear.
- The machine translation moves the phrase ""whether it is right"" to the end of the second sentence, which is not the same as the original text.

**3. Conciseness:**
- The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation does not include the phrase ""about whether the act is right"" in the second sentence.

**4. Register:**
- The machine translation has a more formal register than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation uses more complex words and phrases, such as ""utilities infrastructure"" and ""judgement of a rational utilitarian.""

**Step 3: Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including word choice, sentence structure, conciseness, and register. These differences are due to the limitations of the machine translation algorithm and the fact that it is not able to fully understand the nuances of the source text.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

It has in mind moral ceilings as the starting point for discipline.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

He refers to the point of origin of moral philosophy as a discipline .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the exact phrasing and style of the original text. The reference translation is more accurate in terms of phrasing and style, but it does not capture the nuance of the original text as well as the machine translation.

**Specific differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The source text uses the word ""moraalifilosoofia"" which is a specific term in Estonian that does not have an exact equivalent in English. The machine translation uses the word ""moral philosophy"" which is a more general term. The reference translation uses the word ""moral philosophy"" as well, but it is more precise and refers to the specific type of moral philosophy discussed in the source text.
* **Phrasing:**
    * The source text uses a phrase ""silmas moraalifilosoofia kui distsipliini alguspunkti"" which is a literal translation of the phrase ""ta peab silmas moraalifilosoofia kui distsipliini alguspunkti"" from Estonian. The machine translation uses a phrase ""has in mind moral ceilings as the starting point for discipline"" which is a paraphrase of the original phrase. The reference translation uses a phrase ""He refers to the point of origin of moral philosophy as a discipline"" which is a more accurate translation of the original phrase.
* **Style:**
    * The source text is written in a formal and academic style. The machine translation is written in a more conversational style. The reference translation is written in a style that is somewhere between the formal style of the source text and the conversational style of the machine translation.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good overall translation of the source text, but it does not preserve the exact phrasing and style of the original text as well as the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate in terms of phrasing and style, but it does not capture the nuance of the original text as well as the machine translation.

**Source:** Uurimine, mis segab puhtaid printsiipe empiirilistega, ei vääri isegi filosoofia nime.

**Machine translation:** An investigation that confuses pure principles with empirics does not even deserve the name of a philosophy.

**Reference translation:** Research that confuses pure principles with empirical ones does not even deserve the name of philosophy .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Investigation"" is translated as ""An investigation"" which is a more formal word than ""Research"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is different, with the phrase ""that confuses pure principles with empirics"" being moved to the end of the sentence in the machine translation.
* **Word order:** The word order is different in some places, for example, ""with empirics"" is translated as ""with empirics"" in the machine translation.
* **Phrasing:** The phrasing is different in some places, for example, ""does not even deserve the name of a philosophy"" is translated as ""does not even deserve the name of a philosophy"" in the machine translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Sellepärast on inimese elul või tegevusel mingi hea eesmärk, mis on ülim.

**Machine translation:** That is why a person's life or activity has some good objective, which is the ultimate objective.

**Reference translation:** That is why human life or activity has some good purpose , which is the ultimate .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Objective"" instead of ""purpose""
* **Sentence structure:** Different sentence structure and word order
* **Conciseness:** More concise than the reference translation
* **Formal tone:** More formal than the reference translation
* **Lack of human touch:** Does not capture the nuances of the original text

**Reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Purpose"" instead of ""objective""
* **Sentence structure:** Similar sentence structure to the original text
* **Conciseness:** Slightly less concise than the machine translation
* **More natural flow:** More natural flow and rhythm
* **Human touch:** Captures the nuances of the original text

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

**Source:** Domineeriv filmikompanii on 1932. aastast Norsk Film A/S.

**Machine translation:** The dominant film company of 1932 Norsk Film A / S.

**Reference translation:** The dominant film company since 1932 is Norsk Film A / S .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Omission of the phrase ""since 1932"":** The machine translation does not include the phrase ""since 1932,"" which is present in the reference translation. This omission is a major difference between the machine translation and the reference translation.
* **Different word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""dominant"" instead of ""predominant"" in the reference translation. Although ""dominant"" is a synonym of ""predominant,"" the use of different words can change the tone and style of the sentence.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the time frame ""1932. aastast"" and simply states ""1932."" This lack of precision is a minor difference, but it could be improved in the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

Overall, the machine translation is well-written and captures the meaning of the source text. However, the omission of the phrase ""since 1932"" and the different word choice are major differences that could be improved in the reference translation. The lack of precision in the machine translation is a minor issue that could also be improved.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is in Estonian and reads as follows:

Mõnikord aga ei ole konflikti eri armastustest tulevate motivatsioonide vahel, nii et meil pole allikat ega kohta ühelegi neist vastuseismiseks.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is in English and reads as follows:

Sometimes, however, there is no conflict between the motivation that comes from different love, so we have no source and no place to oppose any of them.

**Step 3: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""conflict"" instead of ""disagreement"" in the source text. This is a common error made by machines, as the word ""conflict"" is more closely related to the word ""war"" than the word ""disagreement.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text slightly. The source text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure. This is because the machine translation is trying to make the text more concise and easier to read.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the source text. This is also done in an attempt to make the text more concise and easier to read.
* **Punctuation:** The machine translation changes the punctuation of the source text. This is because the machine translation is trying to make the text more readable.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways. These differences are due to the fact that the machine translation is not able to fully understand the nuances of the source text. However, the machine translation is still able to provide a reasonably accurate translation of the source text.

**Machine translation:** Some subsequent theories have also assumed that the ethical system should set an example by scientific theory.

**Reference translation:** Some subsequent theorists have also assumed that an ethical system should use a scientific theory as a model.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""set an example"" instead of ""use as a model.""
* Does not specify the scientific theory that the ethical system should use.
* Does not use the same word order as the source text.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""use as a model"" to be more precise.
* Specifies the scientific theory that the ethical system should use.
* Uses the same word order as the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text. The use of the phrase ""set an example"" is a good translation of the phrase ""eeskujuks võtma,"" but it does not convey the same sense of obligation as the phrase ""use as a model."" The lack of specificity in the machine translation also makes it difficult to understand the exact meaning of the source text.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more accurate and captures the nuances of the source text more closely. The use of the phrase ""use as a model"" is a more precise translation of the phrase ""eeskujuks võtma,"" and the specificity of the reference translation makes it easier to understand the exact meaning of the source text.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, captures the nuances of the source text more closely, and is more readable.

    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, moving the modifier ""of this quotation"" to the end of the sentence. This is a grammatical change that alters the flow of the sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words ""first part"" and ""of this quote."" This is a syntactic change that changes the emphasis of the sentence.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style than the reference translation. This is evident in the use of more complex words and phrases.

**Overall, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways, including changes in word choice, sentence structure, word order, and style.**

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Norra ajaloolised piirkonnad Norra ajaloolised maakonnad Norra linnapiirkonnad

**Machine translation:** Norwegian historic regions Norway's historic counties in Norwegian cities

**Reference translation:** Norwegian historic regions Norway 's historic counties Norwegian urban regions

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""historic counties"" while the reference translation uses ""historic regions"" and ""urban regions.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""Norwegian cities"" while the reference translation uses ""Norway 's historic counties.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a more concise sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure.
    * The machine translation does not use any conjunctions between the phrases ""Norra ajaloolised piirkonnad"" and ""Norra ajaloolised maakonnad.""
    * The reference translation uses the conjunction ""in"" between the phrases ""Norway 's historic counties"" and ""Norwegian urban regions.""
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation follows a subject-verb-object order, while the reference translation follows a subject-object-verb order.
    * The machine translation places the phrase ""Norra ajaloolised piirkonnad"" at the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation places it at the end.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including word choice, sentence structure, and word order. These differences are due to the different ways in which the two languages structure sentences and convey the same information.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Kui Conti prints jäi põhja, läks krahv Gages seda teed pidi lõunasse.

**Machine translation:** When the Prince of Cont remained in the north, the collapse of Gages went down that road to the south.

**Reference translation:** When the Prince of Cont remained in the north , Count Gages went down that road to the south .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""collapse"" instead of ""went down"" in the reference translation. ""Collapse"" is a more formal word than ""went down,"" which is more idiomatic in this context.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""road"" instead of ""that road"" in the reference translation. ""That road"" is more specific and clarifies the direction of travel.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, moving the phrase ""when the Prince of Cont remained in the north"" to the beginning of the sentence. This is to make the sentence more concise and clear.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation. The reference translation follows the order of subject, verb, object, modifier. The machine translation follows the order of subject, modifier, verb, object.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words ""the Prince of Cont"" and ""remained"" in the sentence. In the reference translation, ""the Prince of Cont"" is before ""remained."" In the machine translation, ""remained"" is before ""the Prince of Cont.""
* **Grammatical errors:**
    * The machine translation has a grammatical error in the phrase ""when the Prince of Cont remained in the north."" The verb ""remained"" should be in the past tense.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including word choice, sentence structure, word order, and grammatical errors. While the machine translation is generally accurate, it does not capture the exact nuances of the original text.

**Machine translation:**

The overall table describes the results of the batches of the numbers couple written in the package.

**Reference translation:**

In the above table , the pairs if numbers in bold describe the results games.

**Step 2: Comparing the machine translation to the reference translation**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""couple"" instead of ""pairs"" in the second sentence. This is not a major difference, as both words are synonyms.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""batches"" instead of ""results"" in the second sentence. This is a minor difference, as ""batches"" is more specific than ""results.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The reference translation uses a more formal sentence structure than the machine translation.
    * The reference translation uses the phrase ""in the above table"" to clarify that the table is being referred to.
    * The machine translation does not use the phrase ""in the above table.""
* **Word order:**
    * The reference translation changes the order of the words ""pairs"" and ""results"" in the second sentence.
    * The machine translation keeps the order of the words ""pairs"" and ""results"" the same as the source text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does make some minor differences from the reference translation. These differences are not major enough to significantly impact the meaning of the text.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The quality of the Estonian-English translation is good. The machine translation is accurate and well-written, but it does make some minor differences from the reference translation. These differences are not major enough to significantly impact the meaning of the text.

**Reference translation:** Supposedly , when one of them went between the dead , one of the naked semi-dead Estonians jumped up and wanted to kill the citizen .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation, removing the phrase ""supposedly"" and simplifying the sentence structure.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""died"" instead of ""went between the dead"" and "" Karanud"" instead of ""jumped up.""
* **Syntax:** The machine translation follows a different syntax than the reference translation, rearranging the sentence structure and moving the phrase ""wanted to kill"" to the end of the sentence.
* **Tone:** The machine translation has a more neutral tone than the reference translation, which has a more informal and conversational tone.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source:**

The source text is in Estonian and states that science does not use induction.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation accurately captures the main idea of the source text, but it uses different phrasing and word choice than the reference translation.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is very similar to the source text, but it uses more precise language and a more formal tone.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""system"" instead of ""approach"" in the phrase ""The Falsificist system avoids this problem."" This is a difference in word choice that does not significantly change the meaning of the text.
* **Phrasing:** The machine translation uses a different phrasing than the reference translation. The reference translation uses the phrase ""by saying that science does not use induction"" to clarify the relationship between the falsificationist and the use of induction. The machine translation uses the phrase ""by saying that science does not use induction"" as well, but it does not explain the relationship between the falsificationist and the use of induction as clearly.
* **Tone:** The machine translation has a more neutral tone than the reference translation. The reference translation has a more formal and serious tone. This is because the reference translation is written in a more academic style, while the machine translation is written in a more conversational style.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it is not as accurate or as well-written as the reference translation. The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is in the phrasing and word choice. The machine translation uses different phrasing and word choice than the reference translation, but it still captures the main idea of the source text.

**Reference translation:** The current composition of the National Assembly was elected in 2011 and GDP received 107 seats.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
- The phrase ""koosseis valiti"" is translated as ""was elected"" instead of ""was chosen"" in the reference translation.
- The phrase ""GDP sai"" is translated as ""places of GDP"" instead of ""seats"" in the reference translation.
- The sentence structure is slightly different, with the verb ""sai"" being placed at the end of the sentence in the machine translation, while it is placed in the middle of the sentence in the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**
- The phrase ""koosseis valiti"" is translated as ""was chosen"" in the reference translation.
- The phrase ""GDP sai"" is translated as ""seats"" in the reference translation.
- The sentence structure is more similar to the source text, with the verb ""sai"" being placed in the middle of the sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but there are some minor differences from the reference translation. The phrase ""koosseis valiti"" is translated incorrectly, and the phrase ""places of GDP"" is not a precise translation of the Estonian phrase ""107 kohta"".

## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source text**

The text is a news article about the launch of a new car model by the Indian manufacturer Bajaj Auto. The article is well-written and concise, but it could be improved.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. For example, the machine translation does not use the same phrasing as the original text, and it does not include some of the details that are in the original text.

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is much closer to the original text than the machine translation. The reference translation uses the same phrasing as the original text, and it includes all of the details that are in the original text.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Phrasing:** The machine translation does not use the same phrasing as the original text. For example, the machine translation uses the phrase ""new ""saving car model"""" while the original text uses the phrase ""new economy car model.""
* **Details:** The machine translation does not include some of the details that are in the original text. For example, the machine translation does not mention the fact that the Bajaj RE60 is a compact car, while the original text does.
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is not as concise as the original text. The machine translation includes some unnecessary phrases, such as ""which should lead to competition"" and ""who has ruled the market for energy-saving cars so far.""

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text**

The source text is a quote from a text by Jaan Kallas. It is a philosophical statement about the nature of reality and the similarity between humans and animals.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation**

The machine translation accurately translates the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The machine translation uses the word ""peanuts"" instead of ""univocalates,"" which is a more precise term in Estonian. The machine translation also states that ""man and the mother are essentially the same,"" which is not necessarily true. Humans and mothers are not necessarily the same.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation**

The reference translation is more faithful to the original text than the machine translation. It uses the word ""univocalates"" instead of ""peanuts,"" and it also states that ""man and donkey are essentially the same,"" which is a more accurate comparison to the original text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text and captures the nuances of the original text more accurately.

* **Formal vs. informal language:** The reference translation uses more formal language, while the machine translation uses more informal language.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the nature of the Pope's concern, while the reference translation does.
* **Lack of nuance:** The machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original text, such as the use of the word ""muret"" which implies a sense of urgency and seriousness.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for translating the source text, but it could be improved by being more precise and nuanced. The reference translation is the more accurate and faithful translation of the original text.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:**
Liivimaal kogunenud riialaste, liivlaste ja latgalite sõjavägi liikus Sakalasse, kus nendega liitusid ugalased ja nendega koos olnud sakslased.

**Machine translation:**
The army of rivals, widowns and lagese gathered in the country of the Union went to Sakala, where they were joined by the Chinese and joined by the Germans.

**Reference translation:**
The armies of Riga , Livonians and Latgalians gathered in Livonia moved to Sakala , where they were joined by Ugrians and the Germans who had accompanied them .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Main differences:**

* **Order of information:** The machine translation follows a different order of information than the reference translation. The source text first mentions the armies of Riga, Livonians and Latgalians gathering in Livonia, followed by their movement to Sakala. The reference translation first mentions the gathering of the armies in Livonia, followed by their movement to Sakala.
* **Use of synonyms:** The machine translation uses synonyms for some words in the source text, such as ""riialaste"" and ""sõjavägi."" The reference translation uses more precise synonyms for these words, such as ""armies"" and ""military force.""
* **Lack of specificity:** The machine translation does not specify the location of Sakala. The reference translation specifies the location of Sakala as ""Livonia.""
* **Use of different tenses:** The machine translation uses a different tense than the reference translation. The machine translation uses the past tense, while the reference translation uses the past perfect tense.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text as well as the reference translation. The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are due to the different order of information, the use of synonyms, the lack of specificity, and the use of different tenses.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved by making the order of information more consistent with the source text, using more precise synonyms, and specifying the location of Sakala more clearly.**

Kokku oli amnestia andmise ajal Maroko ülerahvastatud vanglates umbes 55 000 vangi.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

In total, there were approximately 55 000 prisoners in Moroccan overcrowded prisons during the amnesty.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

In total , there were approximately 55 000 prisoners in Moroccan overcrowded prisons during the amnesty .

**4. Compare the machine translation to the reference translation:**

* **Similar:**
    * Both translations use the same phrase ""in total"" and ""overcrowded prisons.""
    * Both translations accurately translate the number of prisoners (55 000).
    * Both translations use the same verb ""were"" to describe the prisoners' state.
* **Different:**
    * The machine translation uses the phrase ""Maroko ülerahvastatud"" which is not present in the source text. This phrase is a translation of the Estonian phrase ""Maroko ülerahvastatud"" and is not idiomatic in English.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""during the amnesty"" which is present in the source text. This phrase clarifies the timeframe of the imprisonment and is important for understanding the context of the sentence.
    * The machine translation uses a more formal tone than the reference translation.

**5. Conclusion:**

The machine translation is mostly similar to the reference translation, but there are some differences in phrasing and grammar that make the translation less accurate and less fluent. The use of the phrase ""Maroko ülerahvastatud"" and the omission of the phrase ""during the amnesty"" are the most significant errors in the machine translation.

* **Different verb tense:** The machine translation uses the present tense ""congratulated"" instead of the past tense ""congratulated"" used in the reference translation. This creates a discrepancy in timeline and does not match the context of the source text.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the ""three Presidents"" or mention the ""Baltic Charter."" It simply states the congratulation to ""George W. Bush, President of the United States."" This lacks precision and does not provide enough information for the reader.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""signed"" instead of ""signed"" in the source text. This is a minor difference, but it is noticeable and does not maintain the same style as the reference translation.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. It lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation, and it also uses different verb tenses and word choice. While the machine translation is still understandable and conveys the general meaning of the source text, it does not capture the nuances and style of the reference translation.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""in time"" to convey the same meaning as ""due to meet"" in the reference translation.
* Replaces ""nobility"" with ""art"" to match the word ""art"" in the source text.
* Omits the phrase ""in the election of the king"" from the reference translation.
* Uses the phrase ""with art"" instead of ""in order to vote"" to convey the same meaning.

* Uses the phrase ""due to meet"" to accurately convey the meaning of the source text.
* Maintains the phrase ""nobility"" to match the original text.
* Includes the phrase ""in the election of the king"" to provide a more complete and accurate translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""in time"" and the omission of the phrase ""in the election of the king"" are notable deviations from the reference translation. These deviations may be due to the limitations of the machine translation model or the need to simplify the text for clarity.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is a more accurate and faithful translation of the source text. It maintains the original phrasing and structure, and it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text. However, the use of the phrase ""nobility"" instead of ""noblemen"" may be seen as a slight deviation from the original text.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved. The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it lacks precision and accuracy. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text, but it may be slightly more difficult to read due to the use of more complex phrasing.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Use of colloquial language:** ""Complex tree"" and ""Tears of reality"" are colloquialisms that are not found in the source text.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the nature of Priit's complexes or the severity of his situation.
* **Misinterpretation of the source text:** The machine translation does not capture the nuance of the source text, which emphasizes Saara's ability to console Priit with her presence and her ability to help him overcome his complexes.
* **Use of different sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the source text, which can be confusing for some readers.

**Reference translation:**

* **Use of similar language:** The reference translation uses similar language to the source text, such as ""complexes"" and ""minor concerns of real life.""
* **Precision:** The reference translation is more precise than the machine translation, specifying the nature of Priit's complexes and the severity of his situation.
* **Interpretation of the source text:** The reference translation captures the nuance of the source text, emphasizing Saara's ability to console Priit with her presence and her ability to help him overcome his complexes.
* **Use of similar sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a similar sentence structure to the source text, which makes it easier for readers to follow.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including its use of colloquial language, lack of precision, misinterpretation of the source text, and use of different sentence structure. The reference translation is more similar to the source text in its use of similar language, precision, interpretation of the source text, and use of similar sentence structure.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Samas on senised raiemahud jäänud alla optimaalse koguse ning seega peetakse vajalikuks mahtude kasvatamist.

**Machine translation:** At the same time, current harvests have remained below the optimum amount and therefore it is considered necessary to grow volumes.

**Reference translation:** At the same time , current cutting volumes have remained below the optimal amount and therefore it is considered necessary to increase the volumes .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Grammatical errors:** The sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence should be ""At the same time, current harvests have remained below the optimum amount and therefore it is considered necessary to grow volumes.""
* **Word choice:** The word ""volumes"" is not the best synonym for ""cutting volumes."" The word ""volumes"" is more general and does not fit the specific context of the text. The word ""cutting volumes"" is more precise and accurate.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the ""optimum amount."" The reference translation specifies ""optimal amount.""
* **Missing information:** The machine translation does not mention the reason why the harvests have remained below the optimum amount. The reference translation mentions the reason ""current cutting volumes have remained below the optimal amount.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of good quality. It has several grammatical errors and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The word choice is poor and the translation lacks precision and accuracy.

**Step 4: Conclusion**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It is important to use a human translator to ensure that the translation is accurate and of high quality.

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** Selgus, et patent ei kehtinudki, sest asjaga tegelenud volinik oli unustanud patendi eest maksta.

**Machine translation:** It turned out that the patent did not even exist because the Commissioner responsible had forgotten to pay for the patent.

**Reference translation:** It turned out that the patent was not even valid because the commissioner responsible had forgotten to pay for the patent.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""did not even exist"" to convey the idea of non-existence.
- Does not specify the reason for the non-existence (forgotten payment).
- Uses the term ""Commissioner responsible"" to refer to the person responsible for the patent.

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""was not even valid"" to convey the idea of non-existence.
- Specifies the reason for the non-existence (forgotten payment).
- Uses the term ""commissioner responsible"" to refer to the person responsible for the patent.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""did not even exist"" is a good translation of the source text, but it does not convey the same sense of finality as the phrase ""was not even valid"" in the reference translation. The lack of specification of the reason for non-existence is also a deficiency. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is of high quality. It is accurate, precise, and nuanced. The use of the phrase ""was not even valid"" is a precise translation of the source text. The specification of the reason for non-existence is also a valuable addition to the translation. Overall, the reference translation is the best translation of the source text.

    * The source text uses the word ""lahingu"" (battle), while the machine translation uses the word ""battle"" and the reference translation uses the word ""battles.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The source text has a complex sentence structure, while the machine translation and the reference translation have simpler sentence structures.
    * The source text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation and the reference translation use two sentences.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it has some errors in terms of grammar, word choice, and sentence structure. The main issues are the incorrect pronoun usage, the use of the future tense, and the lack of precision in word choice.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for translating the source text, but it would need some editing to produce a more accurate and fluent translation. The reference translation is the more accurate and fluent translation, as it more closely follows the original text and uses more precise language.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text**

The source text is simple and concise, using clear and direct language. It includes two sentences describing the value of 1 TTD (Trinidad and Tobago Dollar) on two different dates.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and conveys the meaning of the source text. However, it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""equivalent to"" in the second sentence is not ideal, as it does not accurately reflect the relationship between the two currencies.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation**

The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of both precision and clarity. It uses the same phrasing as the source text and accurately reflects the value of 1 TTD on the two different dates.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""amount"" instead of ""equalled"" in the first sentence. This is not a major error, but it does not match the exact wording of the source text.
* **Phrasing:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""equivalent to"" in the second sentence. This phrase is not ideal, as it does not accurately reflect the relationship between the two currencies. The reference translation uses the phrase ""equalled to"" instead, which is more precise.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a slightly different sentence structure than the source text. The second sentence in the machine translation is a bit longer than the second sentence in the source text. This is not a major error, but it does change the flow of the sentence.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation.**

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text**

The source text is a simple sentence stating the date and location of an event, followed by the event itself. It uses the Estonian language with some specific grammar and vocabulary choices.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation**

The machine translation accurately captures the main points of the source text, but it does not preserve the original grammar and vocabulary. It also uses different phrasing and sentence structure than the source text.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation**

The reference translation is very similar to the source text in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and phrasing. It also preserves the original sentence structure.

**Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:**

* **Grammar:**
    * The machine translation uses simpler grammar and more common sentence structures, while the reference translation preserves the original grammar.
    * The machine translation lacks the nuanced grammatical structure found in the source text.
* **Vocabulary:**
    * The machine translation uses more common English words and phrases, while the reference translation uses more specific vocabulary related to Estonia and the Hungarian Revolution.
    * The machine translation does not capture the specific Estonian words and phrases used in the source text.
* **Phrasing:**
    * The machine translation uses different phrasing than the source text and the reference translation.
    * The machine translation often uses more direct and concise phrasing, while the reference translation and the source text use more verbose and descriptive phrasing.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the source text and the reference translation.
    * The machine translation often uses simpler sentence structure, while the reference translation and the source text use more complex sentence structure.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main points of the source text, but it does not preserve the original grammar, vocabulary, and phrasing. The reference translation is much closer to the source text in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and phrasing. However, the reference translation is not perfect and there are some minor differences between it and the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** Sellepärast jäid need paljasteks faktideks, mis ei olnud seotud ja mida ei saanud siduda elektriuurimise käimasoleva progressiga.

**Machine translation:** They therefore remained mere facts that were unrelated and could not be linked to the ongoing progress of the electricity research.

**Reference translation:** Therefore , these remained mere facts that were unrelated and could not be linked to the ongoing progress of electricity research .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""mere"" instead of ""mere"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""progress"" instead of ""progress"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, making it more concise.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""could not be linked"" to the end of the sentence, while the reference translation has it in the middle.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words ""unrelated"" and ""progress.""
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""that were unrelated"" to the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation has it in the middle.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but there are some minor differences from the reference translation. The word choice and sentence structure are slightly different, but the meaning is still clear. However, the word order is a bit jumbled and the use of the word ""mere"" instead of ""mere"" is not ideal.

**Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Reference translation:** So they set the limits of his practical life and fix his image as an active creature .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""limits"" instead of ""boundaries.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""fix"" instead of ""image.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""practical"" instead of ""practical life.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly to fit the English language.
    * The machine translation uses a more active voice.
    * The machine translation uses a more concise sentence structure.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence.
    * The machine translation moves the modifier ""active creature"" to the end of the sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the original text. The word choice and sentence structure are different from the reference translation, and the overall tone is more active. The machine translation is also more concise than the reference translation.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more faithful to the original text than the machine translation. The word choice and sentence structure are similar to the original text, and the overall tone is more neutral. The reference translation is also more verbose than the machine translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the original text. The reference translation is a more accurate translation, but it is also more verbose.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source text:** Kohe saavad sellest külaskäigust teada ka Georg ja Are.

**Machine translation:** Mr Georg and Mr Georg will also be able to report this visit shortly.

**Reference translation:** Georg and Are are soon informed about this visit .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""Mr Georg and Mr Georg"" instead of ""Georg and Are.""
* Uses the phrase ""will also be able to report"" instead of ""are soon informed.""
* Does not include the phrase ""about this visit.""

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""Georg and Are"" instead of ""Mr Georg and Mr Georg.""
* Uses the phrase ""are soon informed"" instead of ""will also be able to report.""
* Includes the phrase ""about this visit.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The use of the phrase ""Mr Georg and Mr Georg"" is inappropriate, as it is not a direct translation of the Estonian phrase ""Georg ja Are."" The phrase ""will also be able to report"" is also not a suitable translation, as it does not convey the same meaning as the phrase ""are soon informed."" The omission of the phrase ""about this visit"" is also a significant error, as it is essential for understanding the context of the text.

**Conclusion:**

The quality of the Estonian-English translation is poor. The machine translation is grammatically correct, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The use of inappropriate phrases and the omission of essential elements have resulted in a translation that is not faithful to the original text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

    * The machine translation uses the word ""Constantinople"" instead of ""Constantinople"" in the reference translation. This is a typo.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to a more complex one. This changes the flow of the sentence and makes it more difficult to read.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the source text. This is also a stylistic error.
* **Overall accuracy:**
    * The machine translation is not very accurate, as it does not capture the full meaning of the source text.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""struggle"" instead of ""battle"" in the source text.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""infection"" instead of ""infantry"" in the source text.
    * The reference translation uses the word ""rough"" instead of ""difficult"" in the source text.
    * The reference translation uses the word ""he"" instead of ""the infant"" in the source text.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation restructures the sentence ""Kui infanti käsk ta lahkuma sundis"" into a separate sentence.
    * The reference translation restructures the sentence ""Kui infanti käsk ta lahkuma sundis"" into a different sentence structure.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words ""raske"" and ""võitlus"" in the source text.
    * The reference translation changes the order of the words ""peaaegu"" and ""võitu"" in the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The word choice is different in some places, and the sentence structure is different in other places. The machine translation also makes some errors in grammar and syntax.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Portugali kõige vihmasem piirkond on Serra da Estrela mäeahelik, kus aasta sademete hulk on tihti üle 2500 mm.

**Machine translation:** The most rainy region in Portugal is Serra da Estrela's mountain heel, where the annual rainfall is often more than 2 500 mm.

**Reference translation:** The most rainy region in Portugal is the Serra da Estrela mountain range , where the annual rainfall is often more than 2 500 mm .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""heel"" instead of ""range"" in the reference translation. ""Heel"" is not a precise synonym for ""range,"" and it does not capture the same sense of vastness and elevation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""often"" instead of ""frequently"" in the reference translation. ""Often"" is not as precise as ""frequently"" in this context.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise and easier to read.
    * The machine translation moves the modifier ""where the annual rainfall is often more than 2 500 mm"" to the end of the sentence, which is not the same as the original text.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence to make it more logical and fluent.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text well. However, it does not capture the same level of precision and elegance as the reference translation. The word choice, sentence structure, and word order are all different from the original text, and they do not always improve the readability or accuracy of the translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not match the quality of the reference translation. The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are the word choice, sentence structure, and word order. These differences are not necessarily detrimental to the overall quality of the translation, but they do make the translation less precise and elegant than the reference translation.

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Ainult moraaliseaduse käskude imperatiivide ignoreerimist me ei saa vabalt valida.

**Machine translation:** It is only by ignoring the imperatives of moral law that we cannot choose freely.

**Reference translation:** It is only the ignoring of the imperatives of moral law that we cannot choose freely.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""imperatives"" instead of ""commands"" in the source. This is a semantic difference, as ""imperatives"" is a more formal word than ""commands.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""it is only"" instead of ""only"" in the reference translation. This is a stylistic difference, as ""it is only"" is a more concise and formal phrase than ""only.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source to a more complex structure in the target language. This is a structural difference, as the source sentence is a simple sentence, while the machine translation sentence is a complex sentence.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""that we cannot choose freely"" to the end of the sentence in the target language. This is a syntactic difference, as the phrase ""that we cannot choose freely"" is in a different position in the source and the machine translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and conveys the meaning of the source text accurately. However, there are some minor differences between the machine translation and the reference translation. These differences are due to the different word choices, sentence structures, and syntactic arrangements used in the two languages. Overall, the machine translation is a good quality translation, but it does not match the exactness of the reference translation.

**Conclusion:**

The quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved. The main areas where the translation could be improved are the word choice, sentence structure, and syntactic arrangement.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a simple sentence that describes a situation where a text should be read out in court by a professional. It includes the name of a person (Kaur Kenderi) and a professional (actor Juhan Ulfsak).

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation accurately captures the main idea of the source text, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation. The main difference is in the phrasing and word choice.

**Machine translation:**
- ""According to Mr Kender, his text should have been read out to the Court by a professional.""
- The phrase ""according to Mr Kender"" is a good translation of the Estonian phrase ""kohtusaalis pidanuks"". However, the phrase ""read out to the Court"" is not a perfect translation of the Estonian phrase ""lugema professionaal"". The Estonian phrase is more specific and requires a more precise translation.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is a more accurate and precise translation of the source text than the machine translation. It uses more similar phrasing and word choice to the source text.

**Reference translation:**
- ""According to Kaur Kender , his text should have been read out in the court by a professional , for example , the actor Juhan Ulfsak.""
- The phrase ""according to Kaur Kender"" is a good translation of the Estonian phrase ""kohtusaalis pidanuks"". The phrase ""read out in the court"" is a more precise translation of the Estonian phrase ""lugema professionaal"".

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. It is more accurate, precise, and clear. The machine translation lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation due to its different phrasing and word choice.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation:**

**Source:** Otsus peaks raskendama gaasitrassi Nord Stream 2 rajamist, mis suurendaks Euroopa Liidu sõltuvust Venemaa tarnitavast maagaasist.

**Machine translation:** The decision should make it difficult to establish Nord Stream 2 of the gas route, which would increase the European Union's dependence on gas supplied by Russia.

**Reference translation:** The decision should make it difficult to establish the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline , which would increase the European Union 's dependence on gas supplied by Russia .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Word choice:**
- The machine translation uses the word ""route"" instead of ""pipeline"" in the second sentence. This is a minor difference, but it does not change the meaning of the sentence.
- The machine translation uses the word ""supplied"" instead of ""provided"" in the second sentence. This is also a minor difference that does not change the meaning of the sentence.

**2. Sentence structure:**
- The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation in the second sentence. The machine translation uses a compound sentence, while the reference translation uses a simple sentence. This is a more significant difference, as it changes the flow of the sentence and the rhythm of the text.

**3. Conciseness:**
- The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. The machine translation uses fewer words to say the same thing as the reference translation. This is because the machine translation does not use unnecessary phrases or words.

**4. Register:**
- The machine translation has a more formal register than the reference translation. The machine translation uses more formal language and is less conversational. This is because the machine translation is intended for a more formal audience.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the machine translation is well-translated, but it does have some differences from the reference translation. These differences are mostly minor, and they do not significantly change the meaning of the text. However, the machine translation does have some differences in sentence structure and conciseness that could be improved.

**Reference translation:**
Davis was released from custody on 8 September , provided that he did not prevent his deputies from issuing marriage certificates to same-sex couples .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Missing verb ""certificates"":**
The machine translation does not include the verb ""certificates"" in the sentence ""abielutunnistuste väljastamist"". This is a key difference from the reference translation.

**2. Different phrasing:**
The machine translation uses the phrase ""same-sex couples"" while the reference translation uses ""same-sex couples"" and ""marriage certificates"".

**3. Lack of formality:**
The machine translation uses a more casual tone than the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""provided that he did not prevent"" in the machine translation is more informal than the phrase ""provided that he did not prevent"" in the reference translation.

**4. Missing modifier ""to"":**
The machine translation does not include the modifier ""to"" after the verb ""issue"".

**Step 3: Conclusion:**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not include some key phrases and words that are in the reference translation.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Üldjuhul aga ei tulene sellest, et kedagi armastatakse tema väärtuslike omaduste pärast, et armastatakse tema omadusi, mitte teda ennast.

**Machine translation:** In general, however, it is not because anyone is loved for their valuable qualities that they love their qualities, not for their own qualities.

**Reference translation:** In general , however , the fact that someone is loved for their valuable qualities does not mean that it is their qualities that are loved , not the person .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is a sentence in Estonian that describes a scientist's work. It uses specific Estonian words and phrases that are not readily translatable into English. For example, the word ""subtiilsematele"" (subtlest) and ""esoteerilisematele"" (esoteric) do not have direct equivalents in English.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation attempts to translate the source text by using synonyms and similar phrases in English. However, it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The phrase ""subservient and esoteric issues"" is a poor translation of ""subtiilsematele ja esoteerilisematele teemadele."" The word ""subservient"" is not a suitable synonym for ""subtiilsematele,"" and the phrase ""esoteerilisematele issues"" is not a close equivalent of ""esoteerilisematele teemadele.""

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text. It uses similar phrasing to the original text and captures the nuances of the Estonian language.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not of high quality and does not capture the nuances of the original text. The reference translation is of much higher quality and is more faithful to the original text.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* The use of synonyms and similar phrases
* The lack of understanding of the specific Estonian words and phrases
* The overall flow and structure of the sentence

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Venemaa käsitles vahejuhtumit Türgi provokatsioonina ja kutsus sellega seoses välja Türgi sõjaväeatašee.

**Machine translation:** Russia treated the incident as a provocation of Turkey and, in this connection, launched a Turkish military office.

**Reference translation:** Russia treated the incident as a provocation of Turkey and , in this connection , summoned the Turkish military attache .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Office instead of attache:** The machine translation uses the word ""office"" instead of ""attache."" This is a common error in machine translation, where the translator may not be able to distinguish between the two words.
* **Lack of formality:** The machine translation lacks the formality of the reference translation. The reference translation uses the word ""summoned"" to show that the action is official and serious. The machine translation does not use this word, and instead uses the more casual word ""launched.""
* **Missing modifier:** The machine translation does not include the modifier ""in this connection"" that is in the reference translation. This modifier clarifies the relationship between the incident and the summoning of the attache.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks the formality and precision of the reference translation. The errors in the machine translation are minor, but they could be improved.

**Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved.**

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Kas saab jõuda eetilise elu põhjendini, lähtudes mõnest minimaalsest teo, soovi või uskumuse struktuurist?

**Machine translation:** Can we get to the root of an ethical life on the basis of a minimum set of actions, wishes or structure of belief?

**Reference translation:** Can we get to the root of an ethical life on the basis of a minimum structure of action , desire or belief ?

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **More formal language:** Uses more formal language like ""root"" and ""structure of belief"" which is not as close to the original text.
* **Different phrasing:** Rephrases the original text in a different way, using different wording and sentence structure.
* **Missing nuances:** Does not capture the nuances of the original text, such as the connection between the minimum structure of action and the ethical life.
* **Lack of precision:** Does not specify the ""minimum set of actions"" or the ""minimum structure of action.""

**Reference translation:**

* **More accurate:** More accurately captures the meaning of the original text, using similar wording and sentence structure.
* **More precise:** Specifies the ""minimum structure of action"" more clearly.
* **More concise:** More concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary details.
* **More natural flow:** Has a more natural flow and readability.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. It is more accurate, precise, concise and has a more natural flow. The machine translation is more formal, uses different phrasing and lacks precision and nuance.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

""Tobago kliima on veidi jahedam, kuid suures osas Trinidadi kliimaga sarnane.""

**2. Read the machine translation:**

""The climate in the Tobago is a little hunting, but to a large extent the climate in Trinidad is similar.""

**3. Read the reference translation:**

""The climate in the Tobagois slightly cooler , but largely similar to that of Trinidad .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""hunting"" instead of ""cooler"" to describe the climate in the Tobago. This word is not a perfect translation of the Estonian word ""jahedam"" and does not convey the same meaning.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""similar"" to describe the climate in Trinidad. This word is not as precise as the Estonian word ""sarnane"" which implies a high degree of similarity.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise and easier to read.
    * The reference translation preserves the sentence structure of the source text more closely.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence to make it more logical and fluent.
    * The reference translation preserves the order of the words in the source text more closely.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal and neutral style.
    * The reference translation has a more conversational and friendly style.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main ideas of the source text, but it does not do a good job of translating the nuances of the language and the style. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text, but it is also more verbose and less readable.

**Recommendations:**

In order to improve the quality of the translation, the following steps could be taken:

* Use a more precise word to translate the Estonian word ""jahedam"".
* Use a more precise word to translate the Estonian word ""sarnane"".
* Preserve the sentence structure of the source text more closely.
* Use a more conversational and friendly style.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Reading the source, machine translation and reference translation**

**Source:** Üks esimesi asju, mida Mortimer Inglismaale tulles tegi, oli Toweris hoitud vangide vabastamine.

**Machine translation:** One of the first things that Mortimer did when he came to England was the release of the prisoners held.

**Reference translation:** One of the first things that Mortimer did when he came to England was the release of the prisoners heldin the Tower .

**Step 2: Comparing the machine translation to the reference translation**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""release"" instead of ""liberate"" as in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""held"" instead of ""heldin"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure from the source to a more concise and direct structure.
    * The reference translation maintains the original sentence structure.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words ""the first things"" to the beginning of the sentence.
    * The reference translation keeps the original word order.
* **Syntax:**
    * The machine translation uses a different syntax than the reference translation.

**Step 3: Analyzing the impact of the differences**

The differences between the machine translation and the reference translation have a minor impact on the overall quality of the translation. The word choice changes are minor and do not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. The sentence structure changes are also minor and do not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. The word order changes are more noticeable, but they do not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. The syntax changes are the most significant changes, and they could potentially make the translation more difficult to read and understand.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the machine translation is a good translation of the source text. However, there are some minor differences between the machine translation and the reference translation that could be improved.

    * The machine translation uses the word ""history"" which is not as precise as ""pre-history"".
    * The reference translation uses the word ""pre-history"" which is more accurate.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The source text uses a complex sentence structure with a long subordinate clause.
    * The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a shorter subordinate clause.
    * The reference translation uses a sentence structure that is similar to the original text.
* **Word order:**
    * The source text follows a different word order than the machine translation and the reference translation.
    * The machine translation follows a more logical order for English speakers.
    * The reference translation follows a similar word order to the original text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the specific language and style of the original text. The reference translation is more accurate in preserving the original text's language and style, while also conveying the same meaning.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Reading the Source Text**

The source text is a sentence in Estonian that describes a person who emphasizes the need to treat everyone, including their loved ones, with respect and compassion.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Machine Translation**

The machine translation accurately captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the original phrasing and style. The translation is more formal and less conversational than the original text. It also uses more abstract language and does not convey the same sense of urgency and passion as the original text.

**Step 3: Analyzing the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is closer to the original text in terms of phrasing and style. It also uses more concrete language and conveys the same sense of urgency and passion as the original text. However, the reference translation does not use the same figurative language as the original text and does not capture the nuances of the Estonian sentence structure.

**Step 4: Comparing the Machine Translation and Reference Translation**

The machine translation is more accurate in terms of capturing the main idea of the source text, but the reference translation is closer to the original text in terms of phrasing and style. The reference translation is more readable and conveys the same sense of urgency and passion as the original text.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved. The machine translation is more accurate in capturing the main idea of the source text, but the reference translation is closer to the original text in terms of phrasing and style. The reference translation is more readable and conveys the same sense of urgency and passion as the original text.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation is in English and attempts to capture the meaning of the source text. However, it is not very accurate and has several errors.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is in English and is a more accurate and detailed version of the source text. It uses more precise language and clarifies the meaning of the source text more fully.

**Analysis of where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses simpler words and phrases than the reference translation. For example, ""kohast"" is translated as ""sites"" in the machine translation, while ""kohast"" is translated as ""places"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more concise structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex structure.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""said bolševikud endale 15"" is translated as ""the Bolsheans themselves got 15"" in the machine translation, while the phrase is translated as ""Out of 42 places , the Bolsheviks got 15"" in the reference translation.
* **Lack of detail:** The machine translation does not include some of the details that are included in the reference translation. For example, the reference translation mentions the specific number of places that were intended for Podolsk, while the machine translation does not.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a short sentence in Estonian that describes a businessperson named Ahmad Ma‘ītīq winning an election and being sworn into office on the same day. The text is clear and concise, but it uses some idiomatic language and specific terminology that may be unfamiliar to some English speakers.

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The translation is also a bit verbose and uses some awkward phrasing. For example, the phrase ""ainsna kandideerima jäänud ärimees"" is translated as ""the only remaining businessman to stand as a candidate"" which is not an exact translation. The phrase ""ametisse vannutati"" is translated as ""was also imprisoned"" which is completely inaccurate.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is much closer to the original text than the machine translation. The reference translation is also more concise and uses more precise language. For example, the phrase ""ainsna kandideerima jäänud ärimees"" is translated as ""the only remaining candidate"" which is a more accurate translation. The phrase ""ametisse vannutati"" is translated as ""was sworn into office"" which is a more precise translation.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of much higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, concise, and uses more precise language. The machine translation is less accurate, verbose, and uses awkward phrasing.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Õnnetuses keegi vigastada ei saanud, kuid merre voolas umbes kakssada tonni naftat.

**Machine translation:** Nobody was injured in the accident, but about two hundred tonnes of oil fell into the sea.

**Reference translation:** Nobody was injured in the accident , but about two hundred tonnes of oil flowed into the sea .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Grammatical errors:** The sentence structure is incorrect. The correct sentence should be ""Nobody was injured in the accident, but about two hundred tonnes of oil fell into the sea.""
* **Word choice:** The word ""fell"" is not the best choice. The word ""flowed"" is more accurate in this context.
* **Lack of precision:** The phrase ""about two hundred tonnes"" is not precise enough. A more precise translation would be ""approximately two hundred tonnes.""
* **Missing information:** The reference translation includes the information ""but about two hundred tonnes of oil flowed into the sea."" The machine translation does not include this information.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It has several errors, including grammatical errors, word choice errors, and lack of precision. The translation is also missing information.

**Step 4: Compare the quality of the machine translation to the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is of much higher quality than the machine translation. It is well-structured, uses accurate words, and is precise. The translation also includes all of the necessary information.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It has a number of errors and lacks precision. The reference translation is of much higher quality and is more accurate and complete.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

* **Verb tense:** The source text uses the past tense ""esitas"" while the machine translation uses the past tense ""was shown.""
* **Word choice:** The source text uses the word ""geomeetrilise"" while the machine translation uses the word ""geostrategic.""
* **Sentence structure:** The source text uses a complex sentence structure while the machine translation uses a simpler structure.
* **Word order:** The source text follows a different word order than the machine translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it lacks accuracy and precision. The main problem is the incorrect subject and the use of the wrong verb tense. The word choice is also not ideal, and the sentence structure is too simple.

**Overall, the quality of the machine translation is poor.** It is not able to accurately capture the meaning of the source text and is not of a high enough quality for use in official or academic settings.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation**

**Source:** Lõplik Karlowitzi rahu lõpetas aastal 1699 Püha Liiga sõjad Osmanite riigiga.

**Machine translation:** The final Karlowitz peace ended in 1699 wars of the Holy League with the Osman state.

**Reference translation:** The final Karlowitz peace ended in 1699 the wars of the Holy League with the Ottoman state .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the term ""Osman state"" instead of ""Ottoman state.""
- Omits the phrase ""the wars of the Holy League.""
- Does not use the same word order as the reference translation.
- Does not use the same level of formality as the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the term ""Ottoman state"" instead of ""Osman state.""
- Includes the phrase ""the wars of the Holy League.""
- Uses a more formal word order.
- Uses a more formal tone.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the same level of formality and precision as the reference translation. The use of the term ""Osman state"" instead of ""Ottoman state"" is a minor error, but it is noticeable. The omission of the phrase ""the wars of the Holy League"" is a more significant error, as it provides important context to the sentence. The use of a different word order and the lack of formality are also noticeable.

**Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it is not as high as the quality of the reference translation.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source:**

Prokuratuur pakkus Kenderile oportuniteeti ehk kokkuleppemenetlust.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The Public Prosecutor's Office offered Kender a choice, or an agreement procedure.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The Public Prosecutor 's Office offered Kender an opportunity , that is , a compromise procedure .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""choice"" instead of ""opportunity"" in the reference translation. ""Choice"" is a more direct translation of the Estonian word ""õigus"", but it does not capture the nuance of ""opportunity"" as well.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""procedure"" instead of ""compromise procedure"" in the reference translation. ""Procedure"" is a more neutral term, while ""compromise procedure"" is more specific and conveys the idea of a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation does not need to be as verbose as the reference translation.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is not trying to be a literal translation of the Estonian sentence structure.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is trying to be more precise and accurate.
    * The machine translation does not use the same register as the reference translation. The reference translation is more conversational and accessible, while the machine translation is more formal and technical.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. The machine translation is more accurate and precise, but it is also more formal and less accessible.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation:**

**Source:** Viimases lahingus hävitas Itaalia armee Austria rünnaku.

**Machine translation:** In the last battle, the Italian army destroyed Austria's attack.

**Reference translation:** In the last battle , the Italian army destroyed Austria 's attack .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Word choice:**
- The machine translation uses the word ""destroyed"" instead of ""defeated"" in the reference translation. This is a semantic difference, as ""destroyed"" is a more forceful word than ""defeated.""
- The machine translation uses the word ""attack"" instead of ""invasion"" in the reference translation. This is a lexical difference, as ""attack"" is a more specific word than ""invasion.""

**2. Sentence structure:**
- The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure than the reference translation. This is a syntactic difference, as the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure to convey the same information.

**3. Word order:**
- The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. This is a syntactic difference.

**4. Punctuation:**
- The machine translation does not use the same punctuation as the reference translation. This is a stylistic difference.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation:**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. The main areas where the machine translation could be improved are the word choice, sentence structure, and word order.

**Step 4: Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for translating the source text into English, but it could be improved. The reference translation is the more accurate and nuanced translation of the source text.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Õiguskirjanduses on viidatud, et alati ei pruugi töövõtuleping olla sõlmitud füüsilise asja suhtes kehalises kujul.

**Machine translation:** The literary has indicated that a contract for work may not always be concluded on physical matters in a physical form.

**Reference translation:** Legal literature has indicated that a contract for services does not always have to be concluded in relation to a physical thing in a physical form .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Use of the word ""literary"":** The machine translation uses the word ""literary"" instead of ""legal"" in the first sentence. This is not a precise translation and does not match the meaning of the original text.
* **Lack of specificity:** The machine translation does not specify the type of contract for work or the subject matter of the contract.
* **Use of the word ""physical"":** The machine translation uses the word ""physical"" twice in the second sentence, which is unnecessary.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the verb ""conclude"" and the incorrect placement of the adverb ""in relation to.""

**Reference translation:**

* **Use of the word ""legal"":** The reference translation uses the word ""legal"" instead of ""literary"" in the first sentence. This is a more precise translation that matches the meaning of the original text.
* **Specificity:** The reference translation specifies the type of contract for work as ""services"" and the subject matter of the contract as ""physical things.""
* **Use of the word ""physical"":** The reference translation uses the word ""physical"" only once in the second sentence, which is more accurate.
* **Grammatical correctness:** The reference translation is grammatically correct.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not of high quality and has several inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The main issues with the machine translation include the use of the word ""literary"" instead of ""legal,"" the lack of specificity, the use of unnecessary words, and grammatical errors. The reference translation is of much higher quality and is more accurate to the original text.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Verb ""suudles"" is not translated:** The verb ""suudles"" is not present in English, so the machine translation substitutes the verb ""visited"" instead.
* **""Koraani"" is translated as ""Koran"":** The word ""koraani"" is translated as ""Koran"" in the machine translation, which is not the correct translation.
* **""Moscheed"" is translated as ""mosques"":** The word ""moscheed"" is translated as ""mosques"" in the machine translation, which is not the correct translation.
* **The phrase ""ja külastas"" is not translated:** The phrase ""ja külastas"" is not translated in the machine translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality due to the following errors:

* **Lack of accuracy:** The translation is not accurate, as it does not translate some of the words correctly and the overall meaning is not the same as the source text.
* **Grammatical errors:** The translation has some grammatical errors, such as the use of the incorrect verb ""visited"" and the use of the plural ""mosques"" instead of the singular ""mosque.""
* **Lack of fluency:** The translation is not fluent, as it uses awkward phrasing and does not flow well.

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is similar to the reference translation in overall meaning and structure. However, there are some differences in wording and sentence structure.

**Key differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""battlefield"" instead of ""battlefield for full strength."" This is a closer translation of the Estonian word ""lahinguks täistugevuses,"" but it does not capture the same sense of intensity as the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""arrive"" instead of ""continued to arrive."" This is a more accurate translation of the Estonian word ""jatkuid,"" but it does not flow as well as the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure than the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is trying to be more concise and to the point.
    * The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure in order to provide more detail and information.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

Kuigi bastione seostatakse tihti Tudorite ajastuga, puuduvad selle toetuseks tõendid.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

Although the Basque is often associated with the Tudorf era, there is no evidence to support it.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

Although bastions are often associated with the Tudor era , there is no evidence to support it .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Subject:** The source text talks about ""bastions"" while the machine translation talks about ""Basque."" This is a mistranslation.
* **Association:** The source text associates ""bastions"" with the ""Tudorite ajastuga"" (Tudor era), while the machine translation associates ""Basque"" with the Tudor era. This is also a mistranslation.
* **Evidence:** The source text states ""puuduvad selle toetuseks tõendid"" (there is no evidence to support it), while the machine translation states ""there is no evidence to support it."" This is a faithful translation.
* **Word choice:** The source text uses the word ""tihti"" (quickly) while the machine translation does not. The reference translation also does not use ""tihti."" This is a minor difference.
* **Sentence structure:** The source text has a different sentence structure than the reference translation and the machine translation. This is due to the different ways of translating the Estonian sentence structure into English.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is mostly faithful to the source text, but there are some mistranslations and minor differences in word choice and sentence structure. The reference translation is more accurate in terms of subject and association, but it also has some minor differences in word choice and sentence structure.

**Recommendations:**

The machine translation could be improved by correcting the mistranslations of the subject and association. The reference translation could be improved by using more precise wording and by correcting the minor differences in sentence structure.

**Reference translation:**
The impact of Byzantine architecture , especially in places of worship , can be found in different regions , from Egypt and Arabia to Russia and Romania .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Subject:** The source text uses the term ""Bütsantsi arhitektuuri"" (Byzantine architecture), while the machine translation uses the term ""Bureau's architecture."" This is a semantic error, as the Bureau is not related to Byzantine architecture.
* **Region:** The source text mentions ""Egiptusest ja Araabiast"" (Egypt and Arabia), while the machine translation mentions ""Egypt and Iraq."" This is a geographical error, as Iraq is not part of Arabia.
* **Word choice:** The source text uses the word ""erinevatest"" (different), while the machine translation uses the word ""different."" This is a synonym error, as the two words have similar meanings.
* **Sentence structure:** The source text uses a complex sentence structure, while the machine translation uses a simpler structure. This is due to the limitations of machine translation algorithms.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does contain some errors in semantics, geography, word choice, and sentence structure. These errors are likely due to the limitations of machine translation technology.

    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a compound sentence to describe the two attacks, while the machine translation uses two separate sentences.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation. The reference translation follows the order of subject, verb, object, modifier. The machine translation follows the order of subject, modifier, verb, object.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. For example, the phrase ""ka Venemaa territooriumilt"" is rearranged in the machine translation to ""from Russian territory.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text**

The source text is a short sentence describing an arrest during a demonstration. It includes the following information:

* The police arrested multiple people involved in the demonstration.
* The arrested individuals include a famous actor and producer named George Clooney.
* The actor's father is also mentioned.

**Step 2: Read the machine translation**

The machine translation accurately captures the main points of the source text, but it has some inaccuracies and poor grammar.

**Differences from the reference translation:**

* **Omission of the actor's father:** The machine translation does not mention the actor's father, as the source text does.
* **Misspelling of ""Cloney"":** The machine translation misspells ""Cloney"" as ""Cloney.""
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has several grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the word ""participant"" and the incorrect placement of the phrase ""including George Cloney.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the source text, such as ""arrest"" instead of ""arrest"" and ""demonstration"" instead of ""protest.""

**Step 3: Read the reference translation**

The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of accuracy and grammar. It includes all of the information from the source text and uses similar phrasing.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main points of the source text, but it has a number of inaccuracies and poor grammar. The reference translation is the more accurate and well-written translation.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Kuigi Vasa oli pärast 333 aastat merepõhjas üllatavalt heas seisus, oleks see kiiresti lagunema hakanud, kui kerel oleks lastud lihtsalt ära kuivada.

**Machine translation:** Although the left was surprisingly healthy on the seabed after 333 years, it would have rapidly collapsed if a leton had simply been allowed to dry.

**Reference translation:** Although Vasa was in a surprisingly good condition after 333 years on the seabed , it would have rapidly deteriorated if the hull had simply been allowed to dry out .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Leton:** The machine translation uses the word ""leton"" instead of ""vessel"" in the second sentence. This is an error, as the word ""leton"" is not synonymous with ""vessel.""
* **Simple drying:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""simply be allowed to dry"" in the second sentence. This is a simplification of the original text, which uses the phrase ""had simply been allowed to dry out.""
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the exact condition of the Vasa after 333 years, such as the degree of deterioration or the specific parts that would have been affected.

**Reference translation:**

* **Vasa:** The reference translation uses the proper noun ""Vasa"" instead of ""left"" in the first sentence. This is an improvement, as it is more accurate and specific.
* **Dry out:** The reference translation uses the phrase ""had simply been allowed to dry out"" in the second sentence. This is a more precise translation of the original text, as it specifies the exact process of deterioration that would have occurred.
* **Precision:** The reference translation is more precise than the machine translation, as it provides more details about the condition of the Vasa after 333 years and the specific parts that would have been affected.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it has some errors and simplifications that make it less precise than the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate and precise, as it uses the proper noun ""Vasa,"" specifies the exact condition of the Vasa after 333 years, and uses more precise phrasing.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation:**

**Source:** Venemaa president Dmitri Medvedev vabastas ametist presidendi eriesindaja NATO juures Dmitri Rogozini.

**Machine translation:** Russian President Dmitry Medvedev released the Special Representative of the President to NATO, Dmitri Rogozin.

**Reference translation:** Russian President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed the Special Representative of the President to NATO , Dmitri Rogozin .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Verb ""vabastas"" vs. ""dismissed"":**

* ""Vabastas"" is a more formal and less common verb in English than ""dismissed.""
* The use of ""vabastas"" in the source text is likely due to the formal tone of the text and the high position of the individuals involved.

**2. Lack of the phrase ""of the President"":**

* The phrase ""of the President"" is included in the reference translation to clarify that Rogozin is the Special Representative of the President.
* The machine translation does not include this phrase, which could be confusing for some readers.

**3. Different word choice:**

* The machine translation uses the word ""released"" instead of ""dismissed.""
* The word ""released"" is not as strong as ""dismissed,"" and it does not convey the same sense of finality.

**4. Lack of punctuation:**

* The source text uses a comma after ""NATO.""
* The reference translation also uses a comma after ""NATO.""
* The machine translation does not use a comma after ""NATO.""

**Step 3: Conclusion:**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does differ from the reference translation in a few ways. The most significant differences are the use of different verbs and the lack of certain phrases. These differences are likely due to the different linguistic conventions used in Estonian and English. Overall, the machine translation is a good approximation of the source text, but it could be improved by making some minor changes.

**Machine translation:** There was an assumption that it was possible that it was precisely for this reason that he was silent in the phosphorus war.

**Reference translation:** Aare guessed that this might have been the reason why he was silent in the phosphorite war .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""assumption"" instead of ""guessed.""
* Uses the phrase ""phosphorus war"" instead of ""phosphorite war.""
* Does not include the phrase ""just sellepärast"" (exactly for this reason).
* Does not use the same word order as the reference translation.

**Machine translation:** The most ancient and largest university is the 1811 Oslo University.

**Reference translation:** The oldest and largest university is the Oslo University , founded in 1811 .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""most ancient"" instead of ""oldest"" to emphasize antiquity.
* Omits the phrase ""University"" after ""Oslo"" to reduce the length of the sentence.
* Does not include the phrase ""founded in 1811"" to provide context about the university's founding.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""oldest"" to accurately convey the meaning of the source text.
* Includes the phrase ""University"" after ""Oslo"" to provide clarity and precision.
* Includes the phrase ""founded in 1811"" to provide context about the university's founding.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it lacks the accuracy and precision of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""most ancient"" instead of ""oldest"" is misleading, as the university is not necessarily the most ancient university in the world. The omission of the phrase ""University"" after ""Oslo"" also makes the sentence incomplete.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is of high quality and accurately conveys the meaning of the source text. The use of the phrase ""oldest"" is precise and accurate, and the inclusion of the phrase ""University"" after ""Oslo"" provides clarity and precision. The inclusion of the phrase ""founded in 1811"" also provides context about the university's founding.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. It is more accurate, precise, and complete. The machine translation lacks the accuracy and precision of the reference translation, and it also makes some stylistic changes that are not necessary.

**Source:**
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz pidas emotsioone ähmasteks tajumusteks ning Kant patoloogiliseks armastuseks.

**Machine translation:**
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz considered emotion to be vague perceptions and Kant's pathological love.

**Reference translation:**
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz considered emotions as vague perceptions and Kant as pathological love .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It combines the two sentences of the source into one sentence in the translation.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation. For example, ""pidas"" is translated as ""considered,"" and ""ähmasteks"" is translated as ""vague perceptions.""
* **Syntax:** The machine translation has a different syntax than the reference translation. The source text uses a complex sentence structure, while the machine translation uses a simpler structure.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words in the source text. For example, the phrase ""ning Kant patoloogiliseks armastuseks"" is translated as ""Kant's pathological love.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The conciseness and the use of different words and syntax make the translation difficult to understand. The change in word order also makes the translation difficult to read. Overall, the machine translation is not of high quality.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is in Indonesian and describes a landslide that destroyed a village called Jemblg on the island of Java in Indonesia. The text is concise and clear, but it uses some Indonesian-specific words and phrases that may not be easily understood by English speakers. For example, the word ""saare"" (meaning ""island"") is not commonly used in English, and the phrase ""hävis maalihkes"" (meaning ""destroyed"") is not a direct equivalent in English.

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text in some places. For example, the translation uses the word ""Jemblg"" instead of ""Jemblg"" in the source text. The translation also uses the phrase ""In the middle of the island of Jaava"" instead of ""In the middle of the island of Java"" in the source text.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of meaning and grammar. However, the reference translation also uses some slightly different phrasing than the source text. For example, the reference translation uses the phrase ""In the middle of the island of Java"" instead of ""In the middle of the island of Jaava"" in the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text in some places. The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of meaning and grammar, but it also uses some slightly different phrasing than the source text.

**Recommendations:**

In order to improve the quality of the translation, the following steps could be taken:

* The translator could use a more comprehensive dictionary and thesaurus to find more accurate translations for Indonesian words and phrases.
* The translator could use a more detailed grammar checker to identify and correct grammar errors.
* The translator could use a more nuanced understanding of the source text to capture the exact meaning and phrasing.

**Machine translation:** However, the Godel theorisation shows that arithmetic cannot be just a series of definitions and conclusions.

**Reference translation:** However , the Gödel theorem shows that arithmetic cannot be just a set of definitions and conclusions .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**Machine translation:**

* **Series of definitions and conclusions:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""series of definitions and conclusions"" to describe the structure of arithmetic. This phrase is not present in the source text.
* **Godel theorisation:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""Godel theorisation"" to refer to the Gödel theorem. This phrase is not present in the source text either.
* **Lack of precision:** The machine translation does not specify the nature of the ""definitions and conclusions"" or the ""series"" of them.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the word ""theorisation"" and the incorrect placement of the pronoun ""that.""

**Reference translation:**

* **Set of definitions and conclusions:** The reference translation uses the phrase ""set of definitions and conclusions"" to describe the structure of arithmetic. This phrase is more precise than the phrase used in the machine translation.
* **Gödel theorem:** The reference translation uses the phrase ""Gödel theorem"" to refer to the Gödel theorem. This phrase is more accurate than the phrase ""Godel theorisation"" used in the machine translation.
* **Precision:** The reference translation is more precise than the machine translation, as it uses more specific terminology and provides a more detailed explanation of the Gödel theorem.
* **Grammatical accuracy:** The reference translation has fewer grammatical errors than the machine translation.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The reference translation is more accurate, precise and grammatically correct. It also uses more appropriate terminology and provides a more detailed explanation of the Gödel theorem.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Konklaavil olid peamised soosikud kardinal Giuseppe Siri ja kardinal Giovanni Benelli.

**Machine translation:** Cardinal Giuseppe Siri and Cardinal Giovanni Benelli were the main favourites of the conversation.

**Reference translation:** Cardinal Giuseppe Siri and Cardinal Giovanni Benelli were the main favourites of the conclave .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Conclave vs. Conversation:** The source text uses the word ""conclave,"" while the machine translation uses the word ""conversation."" This is a semantic error, as the conclave is a secret meeting of cardinals, while the conversation is a spoken exchange of ideas.
* **Peamised soosikud vs. Main favourites:** The source text uses the phrase ""peamised soosikud,"" which means ""main favourites,"" while the machine translation uses the phrase ""main favourites."" This is a minor semantic difference, as the phrase ""main favourites"" is more idiomatic in English.
* **Olid vs. Were:** The source text uses the verb ""olid,"" which is past tense, while the machine translation uses the verb ""were."" This is a grammatical error, as the conclave had already taken place at the time of writing the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is of poor quality. It has several errors in semantics, syntax, and grammar. The main errors are the incorrect use of the words ""conclave"" and ""conversation,"" the minor semantic difference in the phrase ""main favourites,"" and the grammatical error in the verb tense.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a satisfactory translation of the source text. It has a number of errors that make it difficult to understand and interpret. The reference translation is a more accurate and faithful translation of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Ta kutsus 31. jaanuaril 2010 pöörama suuremat tähelepanu nende inimeste puudustele, kes on finantskriisi tõttu kaotanud töö.

**Machine translation:** On 31 January 2010, he called for greater attention to be paid to the shortcomings of those who have lost their jobs as a result of the financial crisis.

**Reference translation:** On 31 January 2010 , he called for greater attention to be paid to the needs of those who have lost their jobs as a result of the financial crisis .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Omission of the phrase ""nende inimeste puudustele"" (their shortcomings).**
* **Use of the phrase ""shortcomings"" instead of ""needs.""**
* **Change of the verb ""kutsus"" (called) to ""he called.""**
* **Change of the phrase ""finantskriisi tõttu kaotanud töö"" (as a result of the financial crisis) to ""as a result of the financial crisis.""**

**Reference translation:**

* **Inclusion of the phrase ""nende inimeste puudustele"" (their shortcomings).**
* **Use of the phrase ""needs"" instead of ""shortcomings.""**
* **Use of the verb ""kutsus"" (called) in the same form as the source text.**
* **Retention of the phrase ""finantskriisi tõttu kaotanud töö"" (as a result of the financial crisis).**

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The omission of the phrase ""nende inimeste puudustele"" is a significant deviation from the source text, and the use of the phrase ""shortcomings"" instead of ""needs"" is not only inaccurate but also emotionally charged. The change of the verb ""kutsus"" to ""he called"" is also a departure from the original text, and it is not clear why this change was made. Overall, the machine translation is a good but not perfect translation of the source text.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is a more accurate and nuanced translation of the source text than the machine translation. The inclusion of the phrase ""nende inimeste puudustele"" is an important addition to the translation, as it helps to more accurately convey the meaning of the original text. The use of the phrase ""needs"" instead of ""shortcomings"" is also a more accurate translation, as it is more closely aligned with the meaning of the original text. The retention of the verb ""kutsus"" in the same form as the source text is also a good translation, as it helps to maintain the rhythm and flow of the original text. Overall, the reference translation is a high-quality translation of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a poetic and expressive sentence that uses vivid imagery and strong emotional language. It is also well-structured and uses a clear rhythm and flow.

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation captures the main ideas of the source text, but it does not preserve the same level of imagery and emotional resonance. The language is also more formal and less conversational than the source text.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is more faithful to the original text in terms of imagery, emotional resonance, and style. It also uses more precise and accurate language than the machine translation.

**Areas where the Machine Translation is Different from the Reference Translation:**

* **Imagery:** The machine translation does not use as much imagery as the source text or the reference translation.
* **Emotional resonance:** The machine translation does not capture the same level of emotional resonance as the source text or the reference translation.
* **Style:** The machine translation is more formal and less conversational than the source text or the reference translation.
* **Language:** The machine translation uses more formal and less precise language than the source text or the reference translation.
* **Structure:** The machine translation does not preserve the same structure as the source text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main ideas of the source text, but it does not preserve the same level of imagery, emotional resonance, style, or accuracy. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text in all of these areas.

**Recommendations:**

* The machine translation could be improved by using more imagery and emotional resonance.
* The machine translation could be improved by using more precise and accurate language.
* The machine translation could be improved by preserving the same structure as the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

Kõik need vaated kas aktsepteerivad emotsiooni kui psühholoogilist seisundit või siis lükkavad selle täielikult tagasi.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

All of these views either accept emotion as a psychological state or completely reject it.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

All of these views either accept emotion as a psychological state or completely reject it.

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is similar to the reference translation in that it accurately captures the meaning of the source text. However, there are some minor differences between the two translations.

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The source text uses the word ""emotsiooni"" which is a direct translation of the word ""emotion"" and is not commonly used in English. The reference translation uses the word ""psychological state"" which is a more precise term.
    * The source text uses the word ""täielikult"" which is a strong word that means ""completely"" and is not exactly equivalent to the word ""completely"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The source text uses a complex sentence structure with a lot of subordination. The reference translation simplifies the sentence structure for clarity.
    * The source text uses a more formal tone than the reference translation.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but there are some minor differences in word choice and sentence structure. These differences are not significant enough to change the meaning of the text, but they could make the translation sound less natural.

**Conclusion:**

The quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved. The translation is accurate and captures the meaning of the source text, but it could be improved in terms of word choice and sentence structure.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is a short sentence in Estonian that includes the following key elements:

* **Date:** ""Aprilli lõpus"" (end of April)
* **Subject:** ""kõnes"" (speech)
* **Speaker:** ""president Vladimir Putin"" (President Vladimir Putin)
* **Action:** ""teatanud leppega võetud kohustuste ajutisest peatamisest"" (announced a temporary suspension of commitments)

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The key elements are present, but the phrasing is different. For example, the phrase ""leppega võetud kohustuste ajutisest peatamisest"" is translated as ""temporary suspension of his commitments to the agreement,"" which is not entirely accurate. The original phrase implies a temporary suspension of all commitments, not just those related to the agreement.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is the closest to the original text in terms of phrasing and accuracy. It uses similar wording to the source text and captures the meaning of the sentence more precisely.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The main difference is in the phrasing of the sentence. The machine translation uses more concise phrasing, while the reference translation is more verbose. The reference translation is closer to the original text in terms of accuracy and style.

**Recommendations:**

* The machine translation could be improved by using more precise phrasing and by capturing the nuances of the original text more accurately.
* The reference translation could be improved by being more concise and by using more active voice.

**Overall:**

The quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved. The reference translation is the best translation of the text, as it is the most accurate and closest to the original text.

**Machine translation:** In Lithuania, the ruling coalition of the party involved in the corruption scandal has announced that it has left the government coalition.

**Reference translation:** In Lithuania , the Labour Party involved in the corruption scandal announced that is leaving the government coalition .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Location:** The machine translation incorrectly states the location as ""Lithuania"" instead of ""Estonia"" as in the source text.
* **Party name:** The machine translation uses the party name ""Labour Party"" instead of ""Tööpartei"" as in the source text.
* **Verb tense:** The machine translation uses the present tense ""has announced"" instead of the past tense ""announced"" as in the source text.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""coalition"" instead of ""coaliton"" as in the source text.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure to fit the English language, resulting in a different flow and rhythm.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to read, but it lacks accuracy in terms of location, party name, verb tense and word choice. The overall quality of the translation is therefore considered to be fair, but not excellent.

**Step 4: Recommendations for improvement.**

To improve the quality of the translation, the following steps could be taken:

* The location should be corrected to ""Estonia.""
* The party name should be translated accurately to ""Tööpartei.""
* The verb tense should be corrected to the past tense ""announced.""
* The word ""coalition"" should be replaced with ""coaliton.""
* The sentence structure should be more closely aligned with the original text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a simple sentence in Estonian that uses the following key concepts:

* **Cardinal Ottobuon:** A high-ranking church official.
* **Inglismaale:** To England.
* **Kogudusest välja heita:** To expel from the congregation.
* **Mässumeelsed:** Rebellious.

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation accurately captures the main idea of the source text, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The key differences are as follows:

* **""Kardiinal Ottobuon tuli Inglismaale"":** The machine translation simply states that Cardinal Ottobuon came to England, without specifying the purpose of his visit.
* **""Et kogudusest välja heita kõik"":** The machine translation uses the word ""all"" to include all rebellious people, while the reference translation uses the more specific term ""those who were still rebellious.""
* **""Kes veel mässumeelsed olid"":** The machine translation does not translate the phrase ""kes veel mässumeelsed olid,"" which is a modifier phrase that describes the rebellious people.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is the closest to the original text in terms of accuracy, precision, and nuance. It accurately captures the meaning of the source text, while also using more precise language and maintaining the original sentence structure.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main idea of the source text, but it lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation. The reference translation is the more accurate and faithful translation of the source text.

**Recommendations:**

* The machine translation could be improved by providing more information about the purpose of Cardinal Ottobuon's visit to England.
* The machine translation could also be improved by using more precise language and translating the modifier phrase ""kes veel mässumeelsed olid"" more accurately.
* The reference translation is the best translation of the source text and should be used as the gold standard for comparison.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Oma valu või mõnd muud oma vaimuseisundit saan vaadelda ainult mina ise ja ma olen sellest vahetult teadlik.

**Machine translation:** My pain, or some other of my spirituality, can only be seen by myself and I am directly aware of this.

**Reference translation:** My pain , or some of my other mental states , can only be observed by myself and I am directly aware of this .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Pain"" is used instead of ""suffering"" or ""mental states"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is different, with the phrase ""can only be seen"" being moved to the end of the sentence.
* **Word order:** The word order is different, with the phrase ""by myself"" being moved to the end of the sentence.
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Pain"" is used in a more specific sense than in the machine translation.
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is more complex, with the phrase ""can only be observed"" being used to modify the verb ""can.""
* **Word order:** The word order is more logical, with the phrase ""by myself"" being placed after the phrase ""can only be observed.""
* **Conciseness:** The reference translation is more concise than the machine translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. The word choice is different, the sentence structure is different, and the word order is different. The machine translation is also more concise than the reference translation.

**Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it is not as high as the quality of the reference translation.**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Suurem osa linnast asub Pahra jõe paremal kaldal, raudteemagistraalist läänes.

**Machine translation:** The majority of the city is on the right side of the River Pahra, the railway tractor in the West.

**Reference translation:** The majority of the city is on the right bank of the River Pahra , west of the railway line .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""tractor"" instead of ""line"" in the phrase ""raudteemagistraalist läänes.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""side"" instead of ""bank"" in the phrase ""paremal kaldal.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, moving the phrase ""the majority of the city"" to the beginning of the sentence.
    * The machine translation does not include the phrase ""west of the railway line.""
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the phrase ""Suurem osa linnast asub Pahra jõe paremal kaldal.""
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""paremal kaldal"" to the end of the sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it does have some differences from the reference translation. The word choice and sentence structure are different, and the word order is rearranged. These differences are not necessarily significant, but they could be improved.

**Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be better.**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

Esmakordselt kümne aasta jooksul oli kogu Euroopas rahu.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

For the first time in ten years there was peace across Europe.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

For the first time in ten years there was peace across Europe .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is similar to the reference translation in the following aspects:

* **The main idea:** Both translations convey the same main idea - there was peace across Europe for the first time in ten years.
* **The tense:** Both translations use the past tense to describe the event of peace.
* **The word choice:** Both translations use similar words to describe the peace, such as ""peace,"" ""across,"" and ""Europe.""

However, there are some differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

* **The tone:** The reference translation is more neutral, while the machine translation is more formal.
* **The phrasing:** The reference translation is more concise and direct, while the machine translation is more verbose and roundabout.
* **The word choice:** The reference translation uses more precise words to describe the peace, such as ""across"" and ""whole."" The machine translation uses more general words, such as ""Europe"" and ""peace.""
* **The syntax:** The reference translation follows a more logical structure, while the machine translation is more fragmented.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it could be improved in terms of tone, phrasing, and word choice. The reference translation is a more accurate and well-written translation, but it is also more verbose and less concise.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation**

**Source:** Venemaa president Dmitri Medvedev nimetas Murmanski oblasti kuberneri kandidaadiks senise kuberneri kohusetäitja Marin Kovtuni.

**Machine translation:** Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has nominated Marin Kovtuni, the Governor of Murmanski Oblast, as the current governor's director.

**Reference translation:** Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has nominated Marin Kovtuni , the former Acting Governor of Murmanski Oblast , for the position of the Governer .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

**1. Lack of clarity:**
- The machine translation does not specify the former acting governor's status as ""former"" or ""former Acting Governor.""
- The reference translation clarifies the former acting governor's status by stating ""former Acting Governor.""

**2. Incorrect verb conjugation:**
- The machine translation uses the verb ""nimetas"" in the present tense, which is incorrect.
- The reference translation uses the verb ""nimetas"" in the past tense, which is correct.

**3. Missing modifier:**
- The machine translation does not include the modifier ""kohusetäitja"" (current governor's).
- The reference translation includes the modifier ""kohusetäitja"" to specify the current governor's position.

**4. Incorrect word choice:**
- The machine translation uses the word ""director"" instead of ""governor.""
- The reference translation uses the word ""governor"" as it is the correct term in this context.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation due to lack of clarity, incorrect verb conjugation, missing modifier, and incorrect word choice. These errors result in a less accurate and less fluent translation.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Saksa idealismi pidas Russell veendumuseks, et maailm koosneb ideest, mitte mateeriast.

**Machine translation:** German idealism considered Russell to be the belief that the world is made up of an idea, not a burial one.

**Reference translation:** German idealism was considered by Russell to be the belief that the world is made up of an idea , not matter .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""burial one"" instead of ""idea"" in the second sentence.
- Does not include the phrase ""not matter"" in the second sentence.
- Does not specify the type of idea (an idea of the world or an idea in general) in the second sentence.

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""idea"" in both sentences.
- Includes the phrase ""not matter"" in the second sentence.
- Specifies the type of idea as ""an idea of the world"" in the second sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it has some errors in grammar and vocabulary. The use of the phrase ""burial one"" instead of ""idea"" is a major error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. The omission of the phrase ""not matter"" is also a major error, as it leaves the sentence incomplete. The lack of specificity in the second sentence is also a problem, as it does not make it clear what is being said.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more accurate and nuanced than the machine translation. The use of the phrase ""idea"" in both sentences is accurate, and the inclusion of the phrase ""not matter"" is essential to the meaning of the second sentence. The specificity of the second sentence is also important, as it makes it clear that the world is made up of an idea of the world, not an idea in general.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. The errors in grammar, vocabulary, and specificity in the machine translation make it less accurate and nuanced than the reference translation.

**Source:** Ühtlasi ootas Valdemar selle eest Ludwigi abi Taani troonile tõusmiseks.

**Machine translation:** Mr Valdemar also waited for Mr Ludford's help in getting to the Danish thrall.

**Reference translation:** In return Valdemar also expected Ludwig 's help in ascending to the Danish throne .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""thrall"" which is not present in the source text. The reference translation uses the word ""throne"" which is more accurate in this context.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""Mr"" instead of ""In return"" in the second sentence. This is not stylistically correct and does not match the tone of the source text.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise. This has resulted in a loss of information and clarity.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the source text. This can be confusing for the reader.
* **Syntax:**
    * The machine translation uses different syntax than the source text. This can make the translation difficult to understand.
    * The machine translation does not use the same verb tense as the source text. This can be confusing for the reader.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is not of good quality. It has made a number of errors in word choice, sentence structure, syntax and overall style. The reference translation is much closer to the quality of the source text. It is more accurate, clear and concise.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source:**

The source text is a concise and direct sentence describing the situation in a military context. It uses specific terminology related to warfare (""Ründajatest läänes lamasid,"" ""briti jalaväelast,"" ""suurtükitule"") and employs a clear structure with a clear subject (""Ründajatest läänes lamasid"") and a clear verb (""lamasid 1500 briti jalaväelast prantsuse suurtükitule eest varju otsides maas"").

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The machine translation attempts to capture the meaning of the source text, but it does not preserve the original structure and uses different terminology (""Of the victims in the West,"" ""burnt up,"" ""shelter from a French bull""). It also introduces additional elements not present in the source text (""hiding behind the cyclone"").

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The reference translation is more verbose than the source text and the machine translation, but it preserves the original structure and uses similar terminology (""To the west of the attackers,"" ""1 500 British infantry troops,"" ""lying on the ground""). It also clarifies the relationship between the attackers and the artillery fire (""trying to find cover from the French artillery fire"").

**Analysis of differences:**

* **Structure:**
    * The source text has a simple sentence structure with a clear subject and verb.
    * The machine translation deviates from the original structure by introducing additional phrases and clauses.
    * The reference translation maintains the original structure but expands upon it to provide more details and clarify the relationship between the elements.
* **Terminology:**
    * The source text uses specific terminology related to warfare (""Ründajatest läänes lamasid,"" ""briti jalaväelast"") that is not commonly used in English.
    * The machine translation uses more general terms (""Of the victims in the West,"" ""burnt up"") that are more familiar to an English speaker.
    * The reference translation uses similar terminology to the source text, but expands on it to provide more details (""1 500 British infantry troops,"" ""lying on the ground"").
* **Additional elements:**
    * The machine translation introduces additional elements not present in the source text (""hiding behind the cyclone"").
    * The reference translation does not include these additional elements.

**Overall:**

The machine translation captures the main meaning of the source text, but it deviates from the original structure and uses different terminology. The reference translation preserves the original structure and uses similar terminology, but it is more verbose than the source text.

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""seems"" instead of ""appears"" in the reference translation.
* **Syntax:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, moving the phrase ""that needs to be approached differently"" to the end of the sentence.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of the words ""interesting case"" and ""that needs to be approached differently.""

**Reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses the word ""appears"" instead of ""seems"" to be more formal.
* **Syntax:** The reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with the phrase ""that needs to be approached differently"" inserted into a subordinate clause.
* **Word order:** The reference translation follows a more traditional sentence structure with the phrase ""that needs to be approached differently"" following the subject and verb.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and captures the meaning of the source text accurately. However, it lacks the elegance and precision of the reference translation. The conciseness and word choice are good, but the sentence structure and word order could be improved.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved by more closely following the syntax and word order of the reference translation.**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:**
Nuüd on teada, et silm ei ole tumedal taustal olevate väikeste valgusallikate suuruse hindamisel usaldatav.

**Machine translation:**
It is now known that the bridge is not credible in assessing the size of small light sources that are on the wind.

**Reference translation:**
It is now known that the eye cannot be trusted when assessing the size of small light sources on a dark background.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the word ""bridge"" instead of ""eye.""
* States that the bridge is ""not credible"" rather than ""cannot be trusted.""
* Does not mention the darkness of the background.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the word ""eye"" instead of ""bridge.""
* States that the eye ""cannot be trusted"" rather than ""is not credible.""
* Mentions the darkness of the background.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to understand, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The use of the word ""bridge"" instead of ""eye"" is a major deviation from the original text, and the lack of mention of the darkness of the background is also a significant omission. Overall, the machine translation is a good but not perfect translation.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more faithful to the original text than the machine translation. The use of the word ""eye"" instead of ""bridge"" is a more accurate translation, and the mention of the darkness of the background is also important for understanding the text. However, the reference translation is a bit more verbose than the original text, and it may not be as easy to read for some people.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good but not perfect translation, while the reference translation is more faithful to the original text. The best translation for this text would depend on the specific needs of the reader.

**Source:** Rahvapärimuse järgi ehitatud see ""vana kloostri vundamentidele"".

**Machine translation:** It was built on the foundations of an 'old monastery' by the inheritance of the people.

**Reference translation:** According to folk legends , it was built on the "" foundations of an old monastery "" .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Foundations of an 'old monastery'"" is a literal translation of the Estonian phrase ""vana kloostri vundamentidele"", which is not idiomatic in English.
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is different from the reference translation. The machine translation uses a simple past tense, while the reference translation uses the compound past tense.
* **Word order:** The word order is different in the machine translation and the reference translation. In the machine translation, the words ""by the inheritance of the people"" are added after the phrase ""built on the foundations of an 'old monastery'"". In the reference translation, the phrase ""according to folk legends"" is added before the phrase ""it was built"".
* **Style:** The style of the machine translation is more formal than the style of the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. The main problems are the word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The machine translation is also not very readable. The style is too formal and the language is too complex.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is in Estonian and describes a cruise event commemorating the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. It uses specific terminology related to the event and the historical tragedy.

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation accurately captures the main idea of the source text, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""Limoral Library"" is a deviation from the source text and is not appropriate. The phrase ""death of the Titanic"" is also not very accurate, as the text refers to the sinking of the Titanic, not the death of its passengers.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of accuracy, clarity, and style. It uses the correct terminology and accurately conveys the meaning of the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for an Estonian-English translation, but it needs significant improvement to reach the quality of the reference translation. The main areas for improvement include the use of more precise language, the removal of unnecessary phrases, and the correction of errors in grammar and syntax.

**Additional Notes:**

* The reference translation is more concise and to the point than the source text and the machine translation.
* The machine translation uses more formal language than the source text and the reference translation.
* The machine translation does not use the same style of writing as the source text or the reference translation.

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Pärast Rahvasteliidu likvideerimist allutati organisatsioon 1946. aastal Ühinenud Rahvaste Organisatsioonile.

**Machine translation:** Following the dismantling of the People's Union, the organisation was subordinated to the United Nations in 1946.

**Reference translation:** Following the dismantling of the League of Nations , the organisation was subordinated to the United Nations in 1946 .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **League of Nations vs. People's Union:** The machine translation incorrectly uses the People's Union instead of the League of Nations as specified in the source text.
* **Subordinated vs. subordinated:** The machine translation uses the word ""subordinated"" instead of ""subordinated"" in the reference translation.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""organisation"" instead of ""organisation"" in the source text.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, making it more concise and less accurate.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Venemaal Volgogradis toimus ühes kortermajas võimas gaasiplahvatus, mille tõttu hoone osaliselt kokku varises.

**Machine translation:** In Volgograd, Russia, there was a powerful gas explosion in one corterhouse, which caused the building to partially collapsed.

**Reference translation:** In Volgograd , Russia , there was a powerful gas explosion in an apartment building , which caused the building to partially collapse .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Main differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""corterhouse"" instead of ""apartment building."" This is a common mistake made by machine translation, as the word ""corterhouse"" is not a word that is commonly used in English.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""collapsed"" instead of ""partially collapsed."" This is also a common mistake made by machine translation, as the word ""collapsed"" is not always the best word to use in this context.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more direct structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex structure.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some errors in word choice and sentence structure. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved.

**Step 4: Make suggestions for improvement.**

* The machine translation could use more precise word choice, such as using the word ""apartment building"" instead of ""corterhouse.""
* The machine translation could use a more complex sentence structure, such as the sentence structure used in the reference translation.
* The machine translation could use a more consistent word order, such as the word order used in the reference translation.

**Machine translation:** Maize is a staple food and is grown in practically all small households.

**Reference translation:** Maize is a staple food and is grown in practically all small households.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""staple food,"" which is a more formal term than the word ""maize"" used in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""small households,"" while the reference translation uses the phrase ""all small households.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation follows a more direct sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex structure with the phrase ""is grown in practically all small households.""
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation follows a different word order than the reference translation.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style than the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text well. However, the use of some less precise words and different sentence structure compared to the reference translation may make the translation sound less natural. The style of the translation is also more formal than the style of the source text and the reference translation.

**Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved.**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Reading the Source, Machine Translation and Reference Translation**

* **Source:** ""Kui sellist skemaatilist koodeksit võtta ühise elu kogu eetilise sisuna, siis sellest on vähe.""
* **Machine Translation:** ""If such a sceptic code is taken as an ethical element of a common life, it is little.""
* **Reference Translation:** ""If such a schematic code is taken as the entire ethical content of common life , it does not suffice.""

**Step 2: Comparing the Machine Translation to the Reference Translation**

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the same structure and style as the reference translation.

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses more formal language (""skeptic code,"" ""ethical element"") than the reference translation (""schematic code,"" ""entire ethical content"").
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the reference translation.
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation.
* **Style:** The machine translation does not preserve the same style as the reference translation. The reference translation is more formal and serious, while the machine translation is more conversational and neutral.

**Step 3: Evaluating the Quality of the Machine Translation**

Overall, the machine translation is a good summary of the source text, but it does not match the quality of the reference translation. The main problem is the difference in style and tone between the two translations. The reference translation is more formal and serious, while the machine translation is more conversational and neutral. This is because the machine translation does not have the ability to understand the nuances of language and style that are present in the original text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for a translation, but it would need to be revised to match the quality of the reference translation. The main areas for improvement include word choice, sentence structure, conciseness, and style.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Võtetel sai ta tuttavaks Quincy Jonesiga, kes tegeles filmi muusikalise poolega.

**Machine translation:** The winners became familiar with Qucy Jong, who dealt with the film's music side.

**Reference translation:** At the shoot , he met Quincy Jones who was responsible for the musical side of the film .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Grammatical errors:** ""Qucy Jong"" should be ""Quincy Jones"".
* **Word choice:** ""Winners"" is not a suitable replacement for ""he"" in this context.
* **Lack of precision:** The phrase ""who dealt with the film's music side"" is too vague and does not specify the responsibilities of Quincy Jones.
* **Inaccurate verb tense:** ""Sai"" is in the past tense, while the reference translation uses the present tense.
* **Unnatural phrasing:** The phrase ""who tegeles filmi muusikalise poolega"" is not idiomatic in English.

**Reference translation:**

* **Precise and accurate:** The phrase ""who was responsible for the musical side of the film"" clearly specifies the responsibilities of Quincy Jones.
* **Grammatical correctness:** The grammar and syntax are correct.
* **Clear and concise:** The language is clear and concise, and the sentence structure is well-formed.
* **Natural phrasing:** The phrasing is natural and flows well.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not of high quality due to numerous errors in grammar, word choice, precision, verb tense and phrasing. The reference translation is of much higher quality, as it is accurate, grammatically correct, clear, concise and natural.

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:** Kolmikpunkti Rwanda ja Tansaaniaga määravad Mwibu ja Kagera jõe voolunõvad.

**Machine translation:** The three points with Rwanda and Tanzania will be determined by the flows of the Mwibu and the Kagera River.

**Reference translation:** The triple point with Rwanda and Tanzania is determined by the flow beds of the Mwibu and the Kagera rivers .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Flow beds vs. flows:** The reference translation uses the phrase ""flow beds"" to describe the Voolunõvad, while the machine translation uses the phrase ""flows."" This is a semantic difference, as flow beds are a more precise term for the physical structure of the riverbed, while flows is a more general term for the movement of water.
* **Point vs. points:** The reference translation uses the phrase ""triple point"" to describe the point where the three borders meet, while the machine translation uses the phrase ""three points."" This is a minor difference, but it is important to note because it could be confusing.
* **Mwibu ja Kagera jõe voolunõvad vs. Mwibu ja Kagera River:** The source text uses the phrase ""Mwibu ja Kagera jõe voolunõvad,"" while the machine translation uses the phrase ""Mwibu and Kagera River."" This is a lexical difference, as the source text uses a more specific term (voolunõvad) while the machine translation uses a more general term (river).

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some differences from the reference translation. These differences are minor in most cases, but they could be improved.

**Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved.**

    * The machine translation uses the word ""thumb"" instead of ""throne."" This is an incorrect substitution that does not match the original text.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""financial"" instead of ""financial"" compensation. This is a closer translation, but it is not the most precise.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure from the original text. The original text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure.
    * The machine translation does not preserve the original word order.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is the closest to the original text in terms of meaning, word choice, and sentence structure.

**Here are the key similarities between the reference translation and the original text:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The reference translation uses the word ""throne"" instead of ""thumb."" This is a more accurate translation of the original text.
    * The reference translation uses the word ""financial compensation"" instead of ""financial"" compensation. This is a more precise translation of the original text.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The reference translation preserves the original sentence structure.
    * The reference translation preserves the original word order.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the exact meaning or the specific relationship between the different parts of the sentence. The reference translation is the closest to the original text in terms of meaning, word choice, and sentence structure.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is in Estonian and describes the speech of a revolutionary minister named István Bibó in Hungary. It uses specific Estonian terminology and phrases, such as ""pisiRevolutsiooniline"" (revolutionary) and ""deklaratsiooniga"" (declaration).

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation accurately translates the main content of the source text, but it does not capture the specific Estonian terminology and phrasing. Instead, it uses more general English terms, such as ""Ms FisiRevolutionary Minister"" and ""declaration on 'Freedom and truth.'""

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text than the machine translation. It uses the same specific Estonian terminology and phrasing as the original text, while also maintaining the overall flow and structure of the text.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Lack of specific Estonian terminology:** The machine translation does not use the specific Estonian terminology used in the source text, such as ""pisiRevolutsiooniline"" and ""deklaratsiooniga.""
* **Generalized phrasing:** The machine translation uses more general English phrases, such as ""Ms FisiRevolutionary Minister"" and ""declaration on 'Freedom and truth,'"" instead of the more precise phrasing used in the source text.
* **Lack of flow and structure:** The machine translation does not capture the flow and structure of the original text as well as the reference translation.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it lacks the accuracy and precision of the reference translation. The reference translation is a more accurate and faithful translation of the source text, as it uses the same specific terminology and phrasing, maintains the overall flow and structure of the text, and captures the nuances of the original language.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Õnn on osalt hinnanguline, mistõttu utilitaristlik maksiim ""Tuleb õnne maksimeerida"" on kahekordselt hinnanguline.

**Machine translation:** Part of the puzzle is estimated, which is why the utilitarian maxim 'must be maximized' is doubly estimated.

**Reference translation:** Happiness is partly evaluative , which is why the utilitarian maximum "" Happiness must be maximized "" is doubly evaluative .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""part"" instead of ""partly"" and ""maximized"" instead of ""evaluative.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a different sentence structure than the reference translation.
* **Word order:** The machine translation has a different word order than the reference translation.

**Reference translation:**

* **Precision:** The reference translation is more precise than the machine translation.

**Source:** Annemai ja Riks leiavad mõlemad, et aina väheneva tööjõuga Uuevariku talus enam hakkama ei saa.

**Machine translation:** Annemary and Riga both consider that the ever decreasing workforce will no longer be able to cope with the new winter.

**Reference translation:** Annemai and Riks both consider that the ever decreasing workforce at Uuevariku Farm can no longer cope.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""ever decreasing workforce"" instead of ""ever decreasing workforce at Uuevariku Farm.""
* Does not specify the location of ""Uuevariku talus.""
* Uses the phrase ""new winter"" instead of ""new winter"" in the original text.
* Does not use the phrase ""enam hakkama ei saa"" in the same way as the original text.

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""ever decreasing workforce at Uuevariku Farm"" to specify the location.
* Uses the same phrase ""new winter"" as the original text.
* Uses the phrase ""enam hakkama ei saa"" in a similar way to the original text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. The use of different phrases and the omission of certain information in the machine translation make it difficult to understand the full meaning of the original text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for translation, but it does not provide a high-quality translation of the original text. The reference translation is a better translation of the original text as it is more accurate and captures the nuances of the original text more closely.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source**

The source text is a simple sentence stating the date and the Prime Minister of Israel at that time. It lacks any context or content.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation**

The machine translation accurately translates the date and the Prime Minister's title, but it lacks the formality and precision of the reference translation. It also does not include the additional phrase ""of Israel"" that is present in the source and reference translations.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation**

The reference translation is the most accurate and formal translation of the source text. It includes all the elements of the source text, including the date, the Prime Minister's title, and the additional phrase ""of Israel."" It also uses more precise language and is more formal than the machine translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is the most accurate in terms of translating the date and the Prime Minister's title, but it lacks the formality and precision of the reference translation. The reference translation is the most accurate and formal translation overall, but it is also the most verbose and complex.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* Lack of formality and precision
* Omission of the phrase ""of Israel""
* Use of less precise language

**Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved by being more formal and precise.**

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Kokkupõrgetes hukkus seitse ja sai vigastada üle kümne tsiviilisiku.

**Machine translation:** In clashes, more than ten civilians died and were injured.

**Reference translation:** In clashes , ten civilians were killed and more than ten were injured .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""died"" instead of ""killed."" This is a semantic difference, as ""died"" is a more neutral term than ""killed.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""more than ten"" instead of ""ten."" This is a lexical difference, as the former is a quantifier and the latter is a specific number.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text. The source text is in the present tense, while the machine translation is in the past tense.
    * The machine translation combines the two sentences of the source text into one sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text. The word choice is different, the sentence structure is different, and the word order is different. These differences make the machine translation less readable and less faithful to the source text.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation. The word choice is similar to the source text, the sentence structure is similar to the source text, and the word order is similar to the source text. This makes the reference translation more readable and more faithful to the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and faithful to the source text.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

Kant claims that we will then always perceive them as having spatial characteristics.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

Kant claims that we will then always perceive them as having spatial characteristics .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is similar to the reference translation in most respects, but there are some minor differences.

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""claims"" instead of ""states"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference in word choice that does not affect the meaning of the sentence.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a slightly different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more formal structure with the verb ""claim"" followed by a clause. The machine translation uses a more concise structure with the verb ""claims"" followed by a direct object. This is a minor difference in sentence structure that does not affect the meaning of the sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. For example, the machine translation moves the word ""spatial"" to the end of the sentence, while the reference translation has it in the middle of the sentence. This is a minor difference in word order that does not affect the meaning of the sentence.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but there are some minor differences from the reference translation. These differences are mostly due to the different ways that English and Estonian use grammar and vocabulary. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation that captures the meaning of the source text accurately.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**
Aastal 1886 liideti Gaboni ala Prantsusmaa Kongoga.

**2. Read the machine translation:**
In 1886, the Gabon site was added to the French Congo.

**3. Read the reference translation:**
In 1886 , the Gabon territory was added to the French Congo .

**Analysis:**

**Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""site"" instead of ""territory."" This is not a precise translation, as ""site"" is not equivalent to ""territory.""
    * The reference translation uses the word ""territory"" which is more precise and accurate.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure from the original text. The original text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation splits the sentence into two sentences.
    * The reference translation preserves the original sentence structure.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of words in the sentence. The original text has the order ""Aastal 1886 liideti Gaboni ala Prantsusmaa Kongoga."" while the machine translation has the order ""In 1886, the Gabon site was added to the French Congo.""
    * The reference translation preserves the original word order.
* **Grammatical errors:**
    * The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the word ""added"" and the incorrect placement of commas.
    * The reference translation has no grammatical errors.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is not a very accurate translation. It has made several changes to the original text, including changes in word choice, sentence structure, word order, and grammar. These changes have resulted in a translation that is not as precise or accurate as the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:**

Veel enam kehtib see juhul, kui diskrimineerija ei mööna, et tema põhjend on see, et tegu on naisega.

**Machine translation:**

This is all the more true if the discriminatory does not admit that her reason is that she is a woman.

**Reference translation:**

This is all the more true if the discriminating party does not admit that their reason is that she is a woman.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""her"" instead of ""their"" in the second sentence. This is not a major error, but it is a difference in style.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the original text slightly. The original text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses two sentences. This is also not a major error, but it does change the flow of the text.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of some words in the second sentence. This is a minor error, but it does affect the clarity of the sentence.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has a few grammatical errors, such as the use of the incorrect verb form ""admit"" in the second sentence.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is of good quality overall. However, there are a few minor errors that could be improved. These errors are not major enough to significantly impact the meaning of the text, but they could be improved with further translation work.

**Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation.**

The machine translation is very similar to the reference translation. The two translations use similar language and structure. However, there are a few minor differences between the two translations. These differences are due to the different ways in which the two translators interpreted the original text.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the machine translation is of good quality. However, there are a few minor errors that could be improved. These errors are not major enough to significantly impact the meaning of the text, but they could be improved with further translation work.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Üldfilosoofilisest ja loodusteaduslikust vaatekohast võib siin näha tõsist teaduslikku puudujääki.

**Machine translation:** From a general philosophical and natural perspective, a serious scientific deficit can be seen here.

**Reference translation:** From a general philosophical and natural science perspective , a serious scientific deficit can be seen here .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""General philosophical"" and ""Natural perspective"" are not exact translations of ""üldfilosoofilisest"" and ""loodusteaduslikust vaatekohast"" respectively. The former is more specific than the latter.
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is different between the machine translation and the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more formal structure with a more complex sentence. The machine translation uses a more concise structure with a simpler sentence.
* **Word order:** The word order is different in the machine translation and the reference translation. The reference translation follows a more logical order, with the most important information (the scientific deficit) coming first. The machine translation follows a more lexical order, with the most important information coming last.
* **Style:** The style of the machine translation is more formal and academic than the style of the reference translation. The reference translation is more conversational and accessible.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved. The machine translation is able to capture the meaning of the source text, but it does not do a good job of preserving the style and structure of the source text. The machine translation also makes some errors in word choice and grammar.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good starting point for a translation of the source text, but it would need to be revised in order to produce a more accurate and faithful translation.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a simple sentence describing the height of a location in Estonia. It uses clear and concise language, and the sentence structure is simple and direct.

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation captures the main ideas of the source text, but it does not preserve the exact wording or sentence structure. The translation is also slightly more verbose than the source text.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is more similar to the source text in terms of wording and sentence structure. It also preserves the original meaning of the text more accurately.

**Areas where the Machine Translation differs from the Reference Translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the source text and the reference translation, such as ""height"" instead of ""height above sea level.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, for example, by moving the phrase ""of sea surface"" to the end of the sentence.
* **Verbosity:** The machine translation is more verbose than the source text and the reference translation.
* **Accuracy:** The machine translation does not preserve the exact meaning of the source text in some cases, such as the use of the word ""about"" to indicate an approximation.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main ideas of the source text, but it does not preserve the exact wording or sentence structure. The reference translation is more similar to the source text in terms of wording and sentence structure, and it also preserves the original meaning of the text more accurately.

**Source:** Eestis Tallinnas algas noorte infomess Teeviit 2007.

**Machine translation:** In Tallinn, Estonia, the youth information gap started in Tehe 2007.

**Reference translation:** The youth information fair Teeviit 2007 started in Tallinn , Estonia .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * ""Noorte infomess"" is translated as ""youth information gap"" in the machine translation, which is not an exact equivalent of the Estonian term.
    * ""Teeviit"" is translated as ""information fair"" in the machine translation, which is not the correct translation. The Estonian term ""Teeviit"" is specifically used for youth information fairs.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The sentence structure is different between the machine translation and the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more formal structure, while the machine translation uses a more concise structure.
* **Word order:**
    * The word order is different in the machine translation and the reference translation. In the reference translation, the order of the words is more logical and follows the natural order of English. In the machine translation, the words are reordered in a way that is not natural to English.
* **Grammatical errors:**
    * The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the word ""gap"" and the incorrect placement of the verb ""started.""

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including word choice, sentence structure, word order, and grammatical errors. These differences are due to the fact that the machine translation is not able to fully capture the nuances of the Estonian language and the specific context of the source text.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

Ta suhtub tulevikku nii, nagu meie suhtume minevikku.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

It is looking to the future as we look at the past.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

He sees future in the same way as we see the past .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the same style and tone as the reference translation.

**Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""looking"" instead of ""sees"" in the reference translation. This is a difference in style and tone.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""future"" instead of ""future in the same way"" in the reference translation. This is a difference in precision and accuracy.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure. This is a difference in style and rhythm.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. This is a difference in syntax and grammar.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main idea of the source text, but it does not preserve the same style and tone as the reference translation. The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are in word choice, sentence structure, and word order.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The text is a simple sentence describing the supervision of the national banking system in Trinidad and Tobago. It includes the following key elements:

* **National banking system:** A specific entity being supervised.
* **Supervised:** The action of overseeing and controlling.
* **Trinidad and Tobago Central Bank:** A specific organization responsible for the supervision.
* **Law adopted in 1986:** A specific law and its year of implementation.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation captures the main elements of the source text, but there are some differences:

* **""Teostab järelevalvet"" is not translated:** This phrase is not directly translated and instead replaced with ""operates under a law."" This is a common idiom in Estonian that does not have an exact equivalent in English.
* **""Mis tegutseb"" is not translated:** This phrase is also not directly translated and instead replaced with ""which operate.""
* **The law adoption year is not specified:** The year ""1986"" is not included in the translation.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is very similar to the source text, but there are some minor differences:

* **""Riigi pangandussüsteemi üle teostab"" is not translated:** This phrase is not directly translated and instead replaced with ""The national banking system is supervised.""
* **The law adoption year is not specified:** The year ""1986"" is not included in the translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation captures the main elements of the source text, but it does not translate some phrases and omit the law adoption year. The reference translation is more faithful to the source text, but it also has some minor differences.

**Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved by translating the missing phrases and including the law adoption year.**

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Siiski oli Sofia ema, Hanna Salin, temaga väga rahul.

**Machine translation:** Yet Sofia's mother, Hanna Salin, was very pleased with her mother.

**Reference translation:** Yet Sofia 's mother , Hanna Salin , was very pleased with her .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""mother"" instead of ""mother's"" in the reference translation. This is a common error in machine translation, where the translator does not always use the most precise word.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""pleased"" instead of ""very pleased"" in the reference translation. This is also a common error in machine translation, where the translator may not be able to capture the exact nuance of the original text.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to a more complex structure in the reference translation. This is because the machine translator is not able to accurately capture the original sentence structure.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation. This is because the machine translator is not able to understand the exact word order of the source text.
* **Style:**
    * The machine translation has a more formal style than the reference translation. This is because the machine translator is not able to capture the informal tone of the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It is different from the reference translation in a number of ways, including word choice, sentence structure, and style. The machine translation is also not able to capture the exact meaning of the source text.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** 19. sajandi keskel kirikut remonditi ja asutati selle juurde iseseisev kogudus.

**Machine translation:** In the mid-19th century, the church was repaired and founded on an independent collection.

**Reference translation:** In the mid-19th century , the church was repaired and an independent congregation was founded there .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Omission of the phrase ""there""**: The phrase ""there"" is omitted in the machine translation.
* **Use of the word ""collection""**: The word ""collection"" is used instead of ""congregation"" in the machine translation.
* **Lack of specificity**: The machine translation does not specify the location of the church or the congregation.
* **Use of passive voice**: The machine translation uses the passive voice, while the reference translation uses the active voice.

**Reference translation:**

* **Inclusion of the phrase ""there""**: The phrase ""there"" is included in the reference translation.
* **Use of the word ""congregation""**: The word ""congregation"" is used instead of ""collection"" in the reference translation.
* **Specificity**: The reference translation specifies the location of the church and the congregation.
* **Use of active voice**: The reference translation uses the active voice, which is more direct and concise.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it lacks the specificity and precision of the reference translation. The omission of the phrase ""there"" and the use of the word ""collection"" instead of ""congregation"" are minor errors that do not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation. However, the lack of specificity and the use of passive voice make the translation less clear and concise.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good approximation of the source text, but it could be improved by being more specific and by using active voice. The reference translation is the more accurate and precise translation, as it includes the phrase ""there,"" uses the word ""congregation"" instead of ""collection,"" and is more specific in its wording.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Kauplusepidajate hulgas on palju lääneaafriklasi ja liibanonlasi, turgudel domineerivad Kameruni naised.

**Machine translation:** There are many western Africans and Lebanese farmers, and markets are dominated by women in Cameroon.

**Reference translation:** There are many western Africans and Lebanese among shopkeepers , and markets are dominated by women of Cameroon .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""farmers"" instead of ""shopkeepers."" This is not a precise translation, as farmers are not necessarily shopkeepers.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""dominated"" instead of ""predominantly."" This is a more forceful word than ""predominantly.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text. The source text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses two sentences.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""markets are dominated by women of Cameroon"" to the end of the sentence. This is not a natural placement for this phrase in English.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence. The source text has the order ""lääneaafriklasi ja liibanonlasi, turgudel domineerivad Kameruni naised."" The machine translation has the order ""There are many western Africans and Lebanese farmers, and markets are dominated by women in Cameroon.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is not a very accurate or well-written translation. It has made a number of errors in word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The reference translation is a much more accurate and well-written translation. It is more faithful to the original text, and it is also more readable and concise.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a simple sentence with the following information:

* **Subject:** Unknown (not included in the text)
* **Verb:** Sent
* **Object:** Messages to the Claretians
* **Time:** 19 September 1991 and 22 September 1997
* **Preposition:** To

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation accurately captures the syntax of the source text, but it does not include the same level of detail as the reference translation. The key differences are:

* **Verb tense:** The machine translation uses the past tense ""sent"" to match the source text, while the reference translation uses the more precise tense ""He sent"" to convey the same meaning.
* **Preposition:** The machine translation uses the preposition ""to"" to connect the object ""messages"" to the verb ""sent,"" while the reference translation uses the more specific preposition ""to the Claretians.""
* **Formalism:** The machine translation is more formal than the reference translation, using the neutral third person ""it"" instead of the more conversational ""He"" and avoiding the use of the colloquial term ""Claretians.""

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of both content and style. It accurately captures the meaning of the source text, while also using more precise language and a more conversational tone.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is able to capture the basic syntax of the source text, but it lacks the same level of detail and precision as the reference translation. The reference translation is the more accurate and faithful translation of the source text, as it uses more precise language and captures the nuances of the original text more closely.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a simple sentence describing a situation where local elders are in peace with their rivals and want them to leave their land. It uses some specific Estonian words and phrases that are not readily translatable into English, such as ""rudolfiga kohtuma"" and ""tulnud kohalikud vanemad.""

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not use the same phrasing or word choice. For example, the machine translation uses the phrase ""have come to meet with Rudolfi"" instead of ""had come to meet with Rudolf."" This is because the machine translation is not able to accurately translate the Estonian phrase ""rudolfiga kohtuma"" which is a specific phrase used in Estonian to describe a meeting with a specific person.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is more similar to the source text than the machine translation. It uses the same phrasing and word choice as the source text, although it does make some minor changes to the sentence structure. For example, the reference translation uses the phrase ""have been in peace with the rivals"" instead of ""have long been in peace with the rivals."" This is because the reference translator has made some minor adjustments to the sentence structure in order to make it more readable in English.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main idea of the source text, but it does not use the same phrasing or word choice. The reference translation is more similar to the source text than the machine translation, but it does make some minor changes to the sentence structure. Overall, the reference translation is the more accurate and high-quality translation of the source text.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is short and concise, using simple language and clear structure. It uses the phrase ""väheneb"" which is a colloquial word meaning ""decreases"" and is not readily translated into English.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and uses clear language, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. It uses the phrase ""falls long"" which is not an accurate translation of ""väheneb"" and does not convey the gradual decrease in precipitation.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is well-written and captures the meaning of the original text accurately. It uses the phrase ""gradually decreases"" which is a more precise translation of ""väheneb"" and conveys the idea of the gradual decrease in precipitation.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""falls long"" which is not an accurate translation of ""väheneb."" The reference translation uses the more precise word ""gradually decreases.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure with a compound predicate, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure with a compound predicate and a participial phrase.
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. The reference translation includes some unnecessary phrases, such as ""at all"" and ""between May and September.""

**Overall:**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and uses clear language, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. The reference translation is well-written and captures the meaning of the original text accurately.

**Recommendations:**

The machine translation could be improved by using a more accurate translation of ""väheneb"" and by using a more complex sentence structure. The reference translation could be improved by removing unnecessary phrases and by using more concise language.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Põlengus sai vigastada kakskümmend viis inimest, neist kümme naist ja viisteist meest.

**Machine translation:** Twenty-five people, ten women and fifteen men were injured in the generation.

**Reference translation:** Twenty-five people , ten women and fifteen men were injured in the fire .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""generation"" instead of ""fire"" in the reference translation. This is a common mistake made by machines, as the word ""generation"" is often used in a similar sense to ""fire"" in Estonian.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""injured"" instead of ""hurt"" in the reference translation. This is also a common mistake made by machines, as the word ""injured"" is more precise than ""hurt.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to a more concise form. This is probably due to the limitations of machine translation algorithms.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the source text. This is also a common problem with machine translation.
* **Word usage:**
    * The machine translation does not use the same word usage as the source text. For example, the machine translation does not use the word ""most"" in the same way as the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some errors in word choice, sentence structure and word usage. These errors are probably due to the limitations of machine translation algorithms. However, the machine translation is still able to provide a readable and understandable translation of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Machine translation:**
The next round of elections will take place on 26 October.

**Reference translation:**
The next round of elections of the Verkhovna Rada will take place on 26 October.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Lack of specificity:** The machine translation does not specify the ""Ülemraada"" (Verkhovna Rada) or the ""valimised"" (elections), while the reference translation does.
* **Lack of formality:** The machine translation uses a more casual tone, while the reference translation uses a more formal tone.
* **Grammatical errors:** The machine translation has some grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of the verb ""toimuvad.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the reference translation, such as ""round"" instead of ""round"" and ""take place"" instead of ""will take place.""
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation has a different sentence structure than the reference translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation**

Based on the above analysis, the quality of the machine translation is fair. However, it could be improved by being more specific, using a more formal tone, correcting the grammatical errors, and using more accurate word choice.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text**

The source text is a political statement that describes the election results in Estonia. It is concise and uses specific terminology related to Estonian politics.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some differences from the reference translation.

**Differences:**

* **Number of regions:** The machine translation says ""13 regions"" while the reference translation says ""7 of the 13 regions."" This is because the machine translation does not understand the phrase ""7 of the 13 regions"" and therefore translates it literally.
* **Party names:** The machine translation uses the exact party names ""Right-wing Republican Party"" and ""Left-wing Socialist Party."" However, the reference translation uses the more common English equivalents ""Republican Party"" and ""Socialist Party.""
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""won"" in the sense of ""gained victory."" However, the reference translation uses the more precise word ""won"" in the sense of ""obtained victory.""

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation**

The reference translation is the most accurate translation of the source text. It uses the correct number of regions, the correct party names, and the most precise word choice.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some differences from the reference translation due to its limited understanding of the source text and its reliance on literal translation. The reference translation is the more accurate and faithful translation of the source text.

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Eksplitsiitne valik ei tundu enamnii tähtis, sest otsustamine toimub suuresti juba enne, ja ei tundu nii ilmne, et seda saab kultiveerida.

**Machine translation:** Expulsion options no longer appear to be so important, because decision making is taking place largely before, and it does not seem so obvious that it can be cultivated.

**Reference translation:** Explicit choice no longer appears to be so important , because decision making is taking place largely before , and it does not seem so obvious that it can be cultivated .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""expulsion"" instead of ""explicit"" in the source text. This word is not a perfect synonym for the source word, and it does not capture the same meaning.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""appear"" instead of ""appears"" in the source text. This word is not a perfect synonym for the source word, and it does not capture the same nuance.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text. The source text uses a complex sentence structure with a dependent clause. The machine translation simplifies the sentence structure and removes the dependent clause.
    * The machine translation changes the order of the sentences in the source text. The source text has two sentences. The machine translation combines the two sentences into one sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the word order of the source text. The source text has a logical word order. The machine translation changes the word order of the sentences.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation:**

The machine translation is not of high quality. It has made a number of errors in word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The translation is also not very clear and concise.

**Step 4: Recommendations:**

The machine translation could be improved by making more accurate word choices, using a more similar sentence structure to the source text, and rearranging the sentences in a more logical order. The translation could also be improved by making it more clear and concise.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is simple and direct, with clear grammar and concise phrasing. It uses some Estonian specific words and phrases that may not be easily understood by English speakers, such as ""originaalis"" and ""kirjastus.""

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. It also uses some incorrect grammar and phrasing, such as ""in the original London publisher"" instead of ""in the original by the London publisher.""

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is the closest to the original text in terms of grammar, phrasing, and meaning. It also uses more precise language and terminology that is more likely to be understood by English speakers.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses some different words than the reference translation, such as ""publisher"" instead of ""kirjastus.""
* **Grammar:** The machine translation has some incorrect grammar, such as ""in the original London publisher"" instead of ""in the original by the London publisher.""
* **Phrasing:** The machine translation does not capture the exact phrasing of the original text as well as the reference translation.
* **Nuances:** The machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for translating the text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. The reference translation is the more accurate and faithful translation of the original text.

**Machine translation:** Rwanda is also part of Francophonie's Association of French States.

**Reference translation:** Rwanda is also part of the Francophonie organisation of French-speaking states.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""Francophonie's Association of French States"" instead of ""Francophonie organisation of French-speaking states.""
- Omits the word ""organisation.""
- Does not use the same phrasing as the source text.

**Reference translation:**
- Uses the phrase ""Francophonie organisation of French-speaking states"" to match the source text more closely.
- Includes the word ""organisation.""
- Uses similar phrasing to the source text.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and easy to understand, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text as well as the reference translation. The use of the phrase ""Francophonie's Association of French States"" is not as accurate as the use of ""Francophonie organisation of French-speaking states."" The omission of the word ""organisation"" also makes the translation less complete.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a concise statement that uses idiomatic language and employs a strong connection between the concepts of ""seeing"" and ""uniqueness."" The key points are:

* **Ainulaadsena nägemine:** Unique seeing
* **Nägemine on nägemise viis:** Seeing is a way of seeing
* **Ainulaadsus on nägemisviisi tagajärg:** Uniqueness is the result of seeing
* **Põhjus:** Not the cause

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation captures the main points of the source text, but it lacks the elegance and precision of the reference translation. The key differences are:

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses more formal and academic language (""way of seeing"") than the source text (""nägemine on nägemise viis"")
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation uses a more complex sentence structure than the source text, which can be difficult to follow
* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is less concise than the source text, and some information is lost in the translation
* **Idiomatic language:** The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic language of the source text (""ainulaadsena nägemine"")

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of style, conciseness, and accuracy. The key similarities are:

* **Word choice:** The reference translation uses similar words to the source text (""way of seeing"")
* **Sentence structure:** The reference translation uses a similar sentence structure to the source text
* **Conciseness:** The reference translation is as concise as the source text
* **Idiomatic language:** The reference translation captures the idiomatic language of the source text (""ainulaadsena nägemine"")

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main points of the source text, but it lacks the elegance and precision of the reference translation. The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of style, conciseness, and accuracy.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

Another important innovation in this sense was to make figures of proportion.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

Another important conceptual innovation was to make figures out of proportions.

**4. Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""figures"" instead of ""figures out of proportions."" This is a semantic error, as ""figures"" does not necessarily imply ""out of proportion.""
* **Syntax:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure from the original Estonian sentence. The original sentence is in the passive voice, while the machine translation is in the active voice. This changes the flow of the sentence and the emphasis of the main point.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words ""important"" and ""conceptual."" This is a stylistic error, as the original sentence has a more logical order of words.
* **Overall meaning:**
    * The machine translation does not capture the exact meaning of the original text. The original text is about the innovation of making figures out of proportions, while the machine translation is about the innovation of making figures of proportion.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways, including word choice, syntax, word order, and overall meaning. These errors are due to the limitations of the machine translation system and its inability to understand the nuances of the Estonian language.

* **Conciseness:** The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation. It uses the phrase ""top 15"" to replace the phrase ""best players of the 15 English-speaking Caribbean countries.""
* **Lack of specificity:** The machine translation does not specify the countries that are included in the top 15.
* **Lack of formality:** The machine translation uses a more casual tone than the reference translation. It does not use the formal phrase ""includes"" and instead uses the more conversational phrase ""it is.""

**Reference translation:**

* **Specificity:** The reference translation is more specific than the machine translation. It lists the 15 English-speaking Caribbean countries and states that the best players of those countries are included.
* **Formality:** The reference translation uses a more formal tone than the machine translation. It uses the phrase ""includes"" to convey a sense of inclusion and completeness.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written and easy to understand, but it lacks specificity and formality. It is also not as accurate as the reference translation. Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it could be improved.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is well-written and accurate. It is also more specific and formal than the machine translation. However, the reference translation is slightly more verbose than the machine translation. Overall, the reference translation is a good translation, but it could be improved.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is concise and direct, using clear and simple language. It includes the following key information:

* **Location:** Estonia
* **Visitor:** Victoria Nuland, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United States
* **Purpose:** Visit to Estonia
* **Meeting:** With Urmas Paet, Estonian Foreign Minister

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation captures the main points of the source text, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation. The following issues are evident:

* **Word choice:** The use of ""Ameerika Ühendriikide asevälisminister"" (United States Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs) is not appropriate. ""Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs"" is the correct term, and ""Ameerika Ühendriikide asevälisminister"" is too verbose.
* **Word order:** The sentence structure is different from the source text. In the source text, the order is ""Eestit külastas Ameerika Ühendriikide asevälisminister Victoria Nuland"". In the machine translation, the order is ""Estonia was visited by Victoria Nuland"". This changes the flow of the sentence and makes it less clear.
* **Missing details:** The machine translation does not include the meeting with Urmas Paet.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is the closest to the source text in terms of word choice, sentence structure, and content. It accurately captures the key information and maintains the original flow of the sentence.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main points of the source text, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation. The main issues with the machine translation are the word choice, word order, and the omission of details. The reference translation is the better translation as it is more faithful to the original text and more clear and concise.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

**Machine translation:** Mysterious weapons of origin have been found in waste-free distilleries.

**Reference translation:** Mycenaean weapons have been found in Cretan burial sites.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Key differences:**

* **Subject:** The source text refers to ""Kreeta matusepaikadest"" (Cretian burial sites), while the machine translation uses ""waste-free distilleries."" This is a semantic error, as the burial sites are not related to distilleries.
* **Object:** The source text mentions ""mükeene päritolu relvi"" (Mycenaean weapons), while the machine translation uses ""weapons of origin."" This is a rephrased translation that does not capture the exact meaning of the original text.
* **Preposition:** The source text uses ""on leitud"" (have been found), while the machine translation uses ""have been found."" This is a minor grammatical error.
* **Word choice:** The source text uses ""Kreeta matusepaikadest"" and ""mükeene päritolu relvi,"" while the machine translation uses ""waste-free distilleries"" and ""weapons of origin."" This is a difference in word choice that affects the overall tone and style of the translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

Based on the above analysis, the machine translation is of poor quality. It has several semantic and grammatical errors, as well as a lack of accuracy in word choice. The translation is also not very readable or clear, due to the use of jargon and ambiguous language.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

**1. Word choice:**
- The machine translation uses the word ""fundamental"" instead of ""fundamental"" in the source text. This is a synonym, but it has a slightly different meaning. The word ""fundamental"" in the source text is used in the sense of ""basic"" or ""essential"", while the word ""fundamental"" in the machine translation is used in the sense of ""important"" or ""crucial"".
- The machine translation also uses the word ""rules"" instead of ""regulations"" in the source text. This is a different word altogether. The word ""rules"" in the source text is used in the sense of ""established guidelines"", while the word ""regulations"" in the machine translation is used in the sense of ""laws"".

**2. Sentence structure:**
- The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the source text. The source text uses a complex sentence structure with a subordinate clause, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure with a parallel structure.

**3. Syntax:**
- The machine translation does not use the same syntax as the source text. The source text uses a lot of passive voice, while the machine translation uses more active voice.

**4. Register:**

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""cows"" instead of ""depressions"" in the reference translation. This is not an accurate translation, as the source text refers to ""depressions"" not ""cows.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""hardfiller"" instead of ""reef"" in the reference translation. This is also not an accurate translation, as the source text uses the word ""reef"" not ""hardfiller.""
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise and easier to read. This is a common translation error, as the original sentence structure may be important for the flow of the text.
    * The machine translation uses the phrase ""quickly drives through"" instead of ""rapidly flows through"" in the reference translation. This is not an accurate translation, as the source text uses the phrase ""rapidly flows through"" not ""quickly drives through.""
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the source text to make the sentence more logical and easier to read. This is also a common translation error.

**Step 3: Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not an accurate translation of the source text. It has made a number of errors in word choice, sentence structure, and word order. The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a short sentence in Estonian that describes Jan Klemens Branicki following Józef Potock as Crown Hetman. The text is clear and concise, and it uses some idiomatic phrases.

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but it has some inaccuracies. The main inaccuracies are:

* **The word ""kroonihetman"" is not translated.** The word ""kroonihetman"" is a specific term in Estonian that does not have an exact equivalent in English. The machine translation uses the word ""crown moment,"" which is not a precise translation.
* **The phrase ""jargnes Józef Potockile"" is not translated correctly.** The phrase ""jargnes Józef Potockile"" is an idiomatic phrase in Estonian that means ""followed as a follower."" The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic meaning of the phrase.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text than the machine translation. The main inaccuracies in the reference translation are:

* **The word ""jargnes"" is not translated.** The word ""jargnes"" is an idiomatic phrase in Estonian that means ""followed as a follower."" The reference translation does not translate the idiomatic meaning of the phrase.
* **The phrase ""Kui kroonihetman"" is not translated perfectly.** The phrase ""Kui kroonihetman"" is a specific term in Estonian that does not have an exact equivalent in English. The reference translation uses the word ""crown moment,"" which is not a precise translation.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

Sellepärast on raske aru saada, miks teine moraalilause hoiatab teo maksiimi ja eesmärgi segiajamise eest.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

It is therefore difficult to understand why a second moral sentence warns of maxim and purpose.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

It is therefore difficult to understand why the second moral sentence warns about confusing the maxim of an act with its objective .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""maxim"" instead of ""maxim"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""purpose"" instead of ""objective"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to a more complex one.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""about confusing the maxim of an act with its objective"" to the end of the sentence.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""therefore"" to the beginning of the sentence.
* **Conciseness:**
    * The machine translation is more concise than the reference translation.
    * The machine translation removes the phrase ""miks teine moraalilause"" from the source text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the meaning of the source text, but it does not preserve the exact wording and sentence structure. The machine translation also makes some changes to the word choice and word order. These changes make the translation more concise and easier to read, but they also make it less faithful to the original text.

**Machine translation:** Riks Mornasse Mare has to receive information from Allana on her succession.

**Reference translation:** Riks comes to Morna to receive information from Allan about Mare 's bequest .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""has to receive"" instead of ""comes to receive"" in the reference translation. This is a difference in word choice that is due to the different cultural norms for formality in English and Estonian.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""succession"" instead of ""bequest"" in the reference translation. This is a difference in word choice that is due to the different meanings of the word ""succession"" in English and Estonian.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more direct sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure. This is due to the different grammatical rules for sentence structure in English and Estonian.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of the words in the sentence compared to the reference translation. This is due to the different word order rules in English and Estonian.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does have some errors. The errors are due to the different cultural norms and grammatical rules for English and Estonian.

* **Esimene püsiv ajaleht:** First lasting newspaper
* **Kurier Polski:** Kurier Polski
* **1729:** Year of publication
* **Piaristid:** Piarists
* **Jesuiidid:** Jesuits

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation**

The machine translation accurately translates the key terms from the source text, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text.

The machine translation uses the word ""peasants"" instead of ""Piarists,"" and it does not mention the Jesuits at all.

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation**

The reference translation is much closer to the original text than the machine translation. It accurately translates the key terms and also captures the nuances of the original text. For example, the phrase ""piaristid ja siis jesuiidid"" is translated as ""Piarists and then the Jesuits.""

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation. It is more accurate, captures the nuances of the original text more closely, and is more faithful to the original language.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

Frankfurti järgi tuleneb see hoopis sellest, et vanemad armastavad oma lapsi väga.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

Instead, according to Frankfurt, it is because parents very much love their children.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

Instead , according to Frankfurt , it is because parents very much love their children .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences from the reference translation.

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""instead"" instead of ""however"" in the reference translation.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""love"" instead of ""very much love"" in the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly, making it more concise.
    * The reference translation uses a more formal tone, while the machine translation uses a more conversational tone.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of some words, for example, ""according to Frankfurt"" is moved to the beginning in the machine translation.
    * The reference translation has a more logical flow, with the cause (parents love their children) followed by the effect (it is because).

**Overall:**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences from the reference translation that could be improved. The main differences are in word choice, sentence structure, and word order.

**Recommendations:**

* The machine translation could use more precise word choice, such as using a more specific word than ""love"" to express the degree of affection.
* The machine translation could use a more formal tone, as the source text is written in a formal tone.
* The machine translation could use a more logical sentence structure, such as keeping the cause and effect closer together.
* The machine translation could use a more consistent word order, such as keeping the same order as the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a concise and direct sentence that uses some specific Estonian words and phrases, such as ""Seetõttu"" (because of that), ""Võimule surnud"" (transferred to), and ""Kuksutati"" (overthrown).

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text. It uses more formal language and does not use the same Estonian phrases as the source text. For example, the phrase ""Seetõttu järgnes"" is translated as ""That is why"" in the machine translation, which is not an exact equivalent.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the original text than the machine translation. It uses more concise and direct language, and it also uses the same Estonian phrases as the source text.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Formal language:** The machine translation uses more formal language than the original text and the reference translation.
* **Lack of nuances:** The machine translation does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation.
* **Phraseology:** The machine translation does not use the same Estonian phrases as the source text.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the original text and the reference translation.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the original text as well as the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the original text, but it is also more verbose and less concise.

**Recommendations:**

* The machine translation could be improved by using more concise and direct language.
* The machine translation could also be improved by capturing the nuances of the original text more accurately.
* The reference translation could be improved by being more concise and direct.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Tagajärgede vaibumise vajadus tuleb sellest, et tavaliselt me ei tea, kas kauged tagajärjed on head või halvad.

**Machine translation:** The need to reverse the consequences comes from the fact that we do not normally know whether the remote consequences are good or bad.

**Reference translation:** The need for the consequences to fade comes from the fact that we do not normally know whether remote consequences are good or bad.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Reverse"" instead of ""fade""
* **Sentence structure:** Different sentence structure, with a more formal tone
* **Word order:** Different word order, with the phrase ""comes from the fact"" being moved to the end
* **Conciseness:** More concise, with some information being condensed
* **Formalism:** More formal, with the use of phrases like ""normally know""

**Reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Fade"" instead of ""reverse""
* **Sentence structure:** Similar to the source text, with a more conversational tone
* **Word order:** Similar to the source text
* **Conciseness:** Less concise, with some information being repeated
* **Formalism:** Less formal, with the use of more conversational language

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The word choice and sentence structure are different, and the tone is more formal. The translation is also less concise than the source text.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is more accurate to the source text, with similar word choice, sentence structure, and tone. However, the translation is less concise than the source text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The reference translation is a more accurate translation, but it is less concise.

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Refleksioon tuleb mängu alles teises staadiumis, kui aru saab aru suhtest, mille ta põhjustas.

**Machine translation:** Reflexony only comes into play at a second stage, if one realises the relationship he caused.

**Reference translation:** Reflexion only comes into play at a second stage , if the mind grasps the relationship that it caused .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Main differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""play"" instead of ""come into play."" This is a synonym, but it does not have the same meaning. The word ""play"" is more casual and informal, while ""come into play"" is more formal and precise.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""relationship he caused"" instead of ""relationship that it caused."" This is a more precise translation, as it clarifies the relationship between the mind and the cause.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The reference translation uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses a simpler sentence structure. This is because the machine translation is trying to be more concise and to the point.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the reference translation. The reference translation uses the order ""if the mind grasps the relationship that it caused,"" while the machine translation uses the order ""if one realises the relationship he caused."" This is because the machine translation is trying to be more logical and to follow the flow of thought more closely.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translation.**

The machine translation is a good translation, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text. The main differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are the word choice and sentence structure.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source:** Armastatu ei pea alati olema nägemisvälja keskmes; tarvis on, et ta saaks piisavalt tähelepanu.

**Machine translation:** Numerous proportions do not always have to be the focus of sight; they need to receive enough attention.

**Reference translation:** The loved one does not always have to be in the centre of the field of vision ; they need to receive enough attention .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Grammatical errors:** ""Numerous proportions"" is grammatically incorrect. It should be ""Numerous proportions"" or ""A numerous proportion.""
* **Word choice:** ""Focus of sight"" is a poor translation of ""nägemisvälja keskmes."" A better translation would be ""centre of attention"" or ""focal point.""
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is different from the original text. The original text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses a simple sentence.
* **Lack of emotional appeal:** The machine translation does not capture the emotional tone of the original text. The original text is written in a tone that is both serious and caring, while the machine translation is written in a tone that is more neutral.

**Reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Loved one"" is a better translation of ""Armastatu"" than ""Numerous proportions.""
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is similar to the original text.
* **Emotional appeal:** The reference translation captures the emotional tone of the original text more closely than the machine translation.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not a very good translation of the original text. It has a number of errors, including grammatical errors, word choice errors, and sentence structure errors. The reference translation is a better translation of the original text. It has a more accurate word choice, a more similar sentence structure, and a more emotional appeal.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Mõis on üks vanimaid piirkonnas ja 1396 ostis Hincke sinna juurde veel lisaks kolm küla.

**Machine translation:** The idea is one of the oldest in the region and, in 1396, Hincke bought there in addition to three villages.

**Reference translation:** The manor is one of the oldest in the region and , in 1396 , Hincke expanded it by buying three more villages .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Idea is replaced with the phrase ""The idea is""** - This is a poor translation as the original text is referring to a manor, not an idea.
* **""Sinna juurde veel lisaks"" is translated as ""there in addition to""** - This is a literal translation that does not fit the context. The original text is saying that Hincke bought three villages in addition to the manor.
* **""Kolm küla"" is translated as ""three villages""** - This is a correct translation.

**Reference translation:**

* **Mõis is replaced with the word ""manor""** - This is a more accurate translation of the original text.
* **""Sinna juurde veel lisaks"" is translated as ""expanded it by buying""** - This is a more natural and accurate translation of the original text.
* **""Kolm küla"" is translated as ""three villages""** - This is a correct translation.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the translations.**

The machine translation is not of good quality. It is inaccurate in many places and does not read well. The reference translation is of much better quality. It is more accurate, reads more naturally and is more faithful to the original text.

**Conclusion:**

The reference translation is the better translation of the original text. It is more accurate, reads more naturally and is more faithful to the original text.

- Uses the word ""Russia"" instead of ""Venemaal"" (Russia).
- Does not specify the duration of the visit (four days).

**Reference translation:**
- Includes the phrase ""neljapäevast"" (four-day).
- Uses the word ""Venemaal"" (Russia).
- Specifies the duration of the visit (four days).

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is a sentence in Estonian that uses figurative language and employs a complex sentence structure. It is also important to note the use of the word ""jumaliku"" which translates to ""godly"" and the phrase ""muutumatu jumaliku maailmaolemuse"" which translates to ""unchanging god of the world.""

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation accurately captures the main idea of the source text, but it does not use the same figurative language and the translation of ""jumaliku"" is not precise. The phrase ""muutumatu jumaliku maailmaolemuse"" is not translated at all. Instead, the machine translation uses the phrase ""unchanging god of the world.""

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is more faithful to the original text than the machine translation. It uses similar phrasing and employs the same word ""jumaliku."" However, the reference translation does not use the same level of figurative language as the source text.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Figurative language:** The machine translation does not use the same figurative language as the source text. For example, the phrase ""voolab"" which translates to ""flowing"" is not used in the machine translation.
* **Precision:** The translation of ""jumaliku"" is not precise. The machine translation uses the phrase ""unchanging god of the world,"" which is not an exact translation of the original text.
* **Phrasing:** The machine translation does not use the same phrasing as the source text. For example, the phrase ""muutumatu jumaliku maailmaolemuse"" is not used in the machine translation.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is able to capture the main idea of the source text, but it does not use the same level of figurative language and precision as the reference translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text, but it does not use the same level of figurative language as the source text.

**Reference translation:**
Finnis says that , if friendship is not conjugal , the activation of friends ' genitals cannot be an actualisation of the common good of their friendship .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""genital mutilation"" which is not present in the source text. This word is a very strong and inappropriate term to use in this context.
    * The reference translation uses the word ""actualisation"" which is not present in the source text either. However, this word is a more accurate translation of the Estonian word ""actualiseerimine"".
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text significantly. The source text is a complex sentence with a long subordinate clause. The machine translation breaks this sentence up into several shorter sentences.
    * The reference translation preserves the sentence structure of the source text more closely.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence. For example, the phrase ""suguelundite aktiveerimine ei saa olla nende sõpruse ühise hüve aktualiseerimine"" is rearranged in the machine translation to ""the activation of friends' genital mutilation cannot be an accessories to their common good of friendship"".
    * The reference translation preserves the order of the words in the source text more closely.

**Overall, the machine translation is very different from the reference translation. The machine translation uses inappropriate language, changes the sentence structure and word order, and does not accurately translate the meaning of the source text.**

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation

**Source:** Mida siis Kant õnnelikkuse kohustusega silmas peab?

**Machine translation:** What, then, does Kant consider to be a commitment of happiness?

**Reference translation:** What , then , does Kant mean by the duty of happiness ?

## Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** ""Commitment of happiness"" is a different phrase than ""duty of happiness."" The phrase ""commitment of happiness"" is not as precise as ""duty of happiness.""
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is different. The source sentence is in the form of a question, while the machine translation is in the form of a statement.
* **Word order:** The word order is different. In the source, the words ""kohustusega silmas peab"" are at the end of the sentence, while in the machine translation, the words ""to be a commitment of happiness"" are at the end of the sentence.
* **Grammatical errors:** There are some grammatical errors in the machine translation, such as the use of the incorrect verb form ""does"" instead of ""does mean.""

**Reference translation:**

* **Word choice:** The word ""duty"" is a more precise word than ""commitment"" in this context.
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is similar to the source sentence.
* **Word order:** The word order is similar to the source sentence.
* **Grammatical accuracy:** The reference translation is grammatically accurate.

## Conclusion

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways. The main differences are in the word choice, sentence structure, word order, and grammatical errors. The reference translation is more accurate and precise than the machine translation.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Sellest tulebki, et mõned eesmärgid on toimingud ja teised on esemed, mis on toimingutest eraldi.

**Machine translation:** This means that some objectives are actions and others are objects that are separate from activities.

**Reference translation:** This means that some objectives are actions and others are objects that are separate from actions.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""actions"" instead of ""objectives"" in the second sentence. This is not a perfect translation as the word ""actions"" does not have the same meaning as ""objectives"" in this context.
    * The machine translation uses the word ""separate"" instead of ""separate from"" in the second sentence. This is also not a perfect translation as the word ""separate"" has a different meaning than ""separate from"" in this context.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text to make it more concise. This may have lost some of the original meaning of the text.
    * The machine translation does not use the same word order as the source text. This can be confusing for some readers.
* **Word usage:**
    * The machine translation does not use the same word usage as the source text. For example, the machine translation does not use the word ""eraldi"" in the second sentence.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways. The main differences are in word choice, sentence structure and word usage. These differences may have lost some of the original meaning of the text.

**Machine translation:** Edgar Savisaar, Mayor of Tallinn, broke a shoe in his farm in Hundisilmal's food.

**Reference translation:** Edgar Savisaar , Mayor of Tallinn , broke a leg while feeding birds at his home farm , Hundisilma .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
- The phrase ""murdis oma kodutalus"" is not translated correctly. The correct translation is ""broke a leg.""
- The phrase ""in his farm in Hundisilmal's food"" is not idiomatic. The correct translation is ""at his home farm, Hundisilma.""

## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** 16. aprillil algas pärast hutude massilist arreteerimist hutude mäss.

**Machine translation:** On 16 April, following mass arrests of Hutu, the Hutu Mountains began.

**Reference translation:** A Hutu riot began on 16 April , following mass arrests of the Hutu .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""Hutu"" instead of ""Hutu"" in the reference translation. This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the context of the sentence and therefore uses the more generic term ""Hutu"".
    * The machine translation uses the word ""mountains"" instead of ""riot"". This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the meaning of the word ""mäss"" and therefore uses a synonym.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text. The source text is in the present tense, while the machine translation is in the past tense. This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the tense of the verb ""algas"" and therefore uses the past tense instead.
    * The machine translation changes the order of the sentence clauses. The source text has the clause ""pärast hutude massilist arreteerimist"" after the clause ""16. aprillil algas"", while the machine translation has the clause ""pärast hutude massilist arreteerimist"" before the clause ""16. aprillil algas"". This is because the machine translation is not able to understand the order of the clauses in the source text and therefore rearranged them.

**Overall, the machine translation is different from the reference translation due to its limited ability to understand context, word meaning, sentence structure, and the order of clauses.**

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is:

**Demonstratsioon oli emotsioonidest kirgas, kuid rahumeelne.**

This text is concise and uses idiomatic language. It also uses strong emotional language (""emotsioonidest kirgas"") to describe the demonstration.

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation is:

**The demonstration was in the coffin of emotions, but peaceful.**

This translation is grammatically correct and uses synonyms for the word ""emotsioonidest"" (coffin of emotions). However, it does not capture the idiomatic nature of the source text and the strong emotional language.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is:

**The demonstration was bright with emotions , but peaceful.**

This translation is very close to the source text in terms of meaning and style. It also uses synonyms for the word ""emotsioonidest"" (bright with emotions).

**Step 4: Compare the Machine Translation and the Reference Translation**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

* **Idioms:** The machine translation does not capture the idiomatic nature of the source text.
* **Emotional language:** The machine translation does not capture the strong emotional language of the source text.
* **Grammatical accuracy:** The machine translation is grammatically correct, but it does not use the same sentence structure as the source text.
* **Style:** The machine translation does not have the same style as the source text.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is not of high quality because it does not capture the idiomatic nature of the source text, the strong emotional language, or the style of the source text. The reference translation is of much higher quality because it is very close to the source text in terms of meaning, style, and grammar.

* **Word choice:** ""Kirjutavatest"" is translated as ""writing in the language of"" which is not an exact translation of the Estonian word ""kirjutavatest"". The word ""language of"" is unnecessary in this sentence.
* **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure is different between the machine translation and the reference translation. The reference translation uses a more formal structure with the phrase ""of the writers writing in the Nyanja language"". The machine translation uses a more concise structure with the phrase ""The writers writing in the language of Njandža"".
* **Word order:** The word order is different in the machine translation and the reference translation. In the reference translation, the phrase ""Jolly Maxwell Ntaba"" is placed after the phrase ""best-known ones"". In the machine translation, the phrase ""Jolly Maxwell Ntaba"" is placed before the phrase ""best-known ones"".
* **Style:** The style of the machine translation is more formal and less conversational than the style of the reference translation.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways. The word choice, sentence structure, word order and style are all different. While the machine translation is still understandable, it is not as accurate or as well-written as the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the Source Text**

The source text is in Estonian and describes the historical relationship between Sweden, Rzeczpospolita (Lithuania), and the Baltic Sea trade. The text is concise and uses some specific Estonian words and phrases that may be difficult for a translator to accurately translate.

**Step 2: Analyze the Machine Translation**

The machine translation is well-structured and uses clear and concise language. However, it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text in some areas. For example, the machine translation uses the phrase ""Union"" instead of ""Livonia"" to describe Sweden's holdings. The machine translation also does not mention the period of prosperity that Kurland entered as a result of Lithuania's takeover of Baltic Sea trade.

**Step 3: Analyze the Reference Translation**

The reference translation is well-written and accurately captures the meaning of the source text. It uses clear and concise language and accurately translates the Estonian words and phrases. The reference translation also mentions the period of prosperity that Kurland entered as a result of Lithuania's takeover of Baltic Sea trade.

**Step 4: Compare the Machine Translation and the Reference Translation**

The machine translation is well-structured and uses clear and concise language, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text in some areas. The reference translation is more accurate and captures the meaning of the source text more closely.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved. The machine translation is well-structured and uses clear and concise language, but it does not capture the exact meaning of the source text in some areas. The reference translation is more accurate and captures the meaning of the source text more closely.

## Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Kindlasti on tegelik liikide arv oluliselt suurem, sest hinnanguliselt on maailma seeneliikidest tänaseks avastatud vaid umbes 7%.

**Machine translation:** The actual number of species is certainly significantly higher, as it is estimated that only about 7% of the world's pig species have been detected to date.

**Reference translation:** The actual number of species is certainly significantly higher , as it is estimated that only about 7 % of the world 's mushroom species have been discovered to date .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Subject:** The source text talks about ""liikide arv"", which translates to ""pig species"". The machine translation incorrectly uses ""pig species"" instead of ""mushroom species"".
* **Verb tense:** The source text uses the future tense ""avastatud"" (detected), while the machine translation uses the past tense ""have been detected"".
* **Word choice:** The source text uses the word ""oluliselt"" (significantly) to emphasize the high number, while the machine translation uses ""certainly"" to convey the same meaning.
* **Word order:** The source text follows a different word order than the reference translation.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some differences from the reference translation. The most significant difference is the incorrect use of the subject ""pig species"" instead of ""mushroom species"". The machine translation also makes some minor errors with verb tense and word choice.

**Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is good, but it could be improved.**

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Analyze the source text:**

The source text is short and simple, using clear and concise language. It states the current air temperature and the possibility of future temperature drops.

**Step 2: Analyze the machine translation:**

The machine translation is grammatically correct and conveys the main idea of the source text. However, it lacks the precision and clarity of the source text. The phrase ""around 30 ° C"" is not as precise as ""around 30 ° C in the summer."" The phrase ""may fall to 5 ° C"" is also not as clear as ""may fall to 5 ° C over winter.""

**Step 3: Analyze the reference translation:**

The reference translation is very similar to the source text, using the same phrasing and structure. It is also clear and concise.

**Areas where the machine translation differs from the reference translation:**

* **Precision:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""around"" to indicate the approximate temperature, which is not as precise as the source text.
* **Clarity:** The machine translation uses the phrase ""may fall to"" to indicate the possibility of future temperature drops, which is not as clear as the source text.
* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses different words than the source text, such as ""temperatures will be"" instead of ""air temperatures will be.""
* **Structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure slightly from the source text.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good attempt to translate the source text, but it lacks the precision and clarity of the reference translation. The main idea of the text is conveyed, but the phrasing and word choice could be improved.

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation, and reference translation.**

**Source text:**
Jüriöö ülestõusu teemat on palju kasutatud ilukirjanduses ja muudes kunstiteostes.

**Machine translation:**
The theme of the Jury's uprising has been much used in literature and other works of art.

**Reference translation:**
The theme of the St. George 's Night Uprising has been much used in literature and other works of art.

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""Jury's uprising"" instead of ""St. George 's Night Uprising.""
* Does not mention the specific theme of the uprising.
* Does not use the word ""teemat"" (theme) in the same way as the source text.
* Uses the word ""works of art"" instead of ""other works of art.""

**Reference translation:**
* Uses the phrase ""St. George 's Night Uprising"" exactly as in the source text.
* Mentions the specific theme of the uprising.
* Uses the word ""teemat"" (theme) in the same way as the source text.
* Uses the phrase ""other works of art"" instead of ""works of art.""

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text as well as the reference translation. The use of different phrases and the omission of certain words (such as ""St. George 's Night Uprising"" and ""teemat"") make the translation less faithful to the original text.

**Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the reference translation.**

The reference translation is of high quality and captures the nuances of the source text very well. The use of precise language and the accurate translation of key terms make the translation very close to the original text.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English translation is higher in the reference translation than in the machine translation. The reference translation is more faithful to the original text and captures the nuances of the source text more accurately.

## Quality Evaluation of Estonian-English Translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Tulistamises sai haavata kuus inimest, teiste seas Esindajatekoja liige Steve Scalise.

**Machine translation:** Six people were injured in the income, including Steve Scalise, Member of the House of Representatives.

**Reference translation:** Six people were injured in the shooting , including Steve Scalise , Member of the House of Representatives .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * ""Tulistamises"" is translated as ""shooting"" in the reference translation, but ""income"" in the machine translation. ""Income"" is not a synonym for ""shooting.""
    * ""Esindajatekoja liige"" is translated as ""Member of the House of Representatives"" in the reference translation, but ""Member of the House of Representatives"" in the machine translation. This is a more precise translation, as it includes the specific body of government that Steve Scalise belongs to.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The source text uses a compound sentence structure, while the machine translation and the reference translation use a simpler sentence structure. This is due to the difference in language style between Estonian and English.
    * The source text uses the passive voice, while the machine translation and the reference translation use the active voice. This is also due to the difference in language style between Estonian and English.
* **Word order:**
    * The source text follows a different word order than the reference translation and the machine translation. This is due to the different sentence structure and the different language styles of Estonian and English.

**Step 3: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is generally accurate, but it does not capture the nuances of the source text as well as the reference translation. The main problems with the machine translation are the word choice and the sentence structure.

**Conclusion:**

The machine translation is a good starting point for translating the source text, but it would need to be revised to improve the accuracy and fluency of the translation. The reference translation is the more accurate and fluent translation, but it is also more verbose and less concise than the machine translation.

**Reference translation:** There is a preserved manuscript by Eckhart , on which he has written a few side notes in his own hand .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Machine translation:**

* **Word choice:** The machine translation uses the word ""handletter"" instead of ""manuscript."" This is a more informal word and does not match the tone of the original text.
* **Sentence structure:** The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the original text. The original text uses a complex sentence structure with a dependent clause. The machine translation simplifies the sentence structure and loses some of the original meaning.
* **Word order:** The machine translation changes the order of words in the sentence. The original text has a more logical order of words. The machine translation rearranged the words in a way that is not as clear.
* **Style:** The machine translation has a more formal style than the original text. The original text is more conversational and friendly.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a number of ways. The main differences are in the word choice, sentence structure, word order, and style. These differences make the machine translation less accurate and less readable than the reference translation.

## Step-by-step evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**1. Read the source text:**

Küsimus ei eelda, et tuleb arvestada tingimata moraalseid kaalutlusi.

**2. Read the machine translation:**

The issue does not imply that moral considerations must necessarily be taken into account.

**3. Read the reference translation:**

The issue does not imply that moral considerations must necessarily be taken into account .

**Analysis:**

The machine translation is similar to the reference translation in most respects, but there are some minor differences.

**Differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""implies"" instead of ""suggests"" in the reference translation. This is a closer translation of the Estonian word ""eelda,"" which has a slightly more forceful tone than ""suggests.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""necessary"" instead of ""unnecessary"" in the reference translation. This is a more precise translation of the Estonian word ""tingimata,"" which emphasizes the lack of necessity.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation restructures the sentence slightly to make it more concise and clear. This is a common translation technique in English, as Estonian sentences tend to be longer and more complex than English sentences.
    * The machine translation moves the modifier ""necessarily"" closer to the verb ""take into account."" This is a more natural placement for the modifier in English.

**Overall:**

The machine translation is a good translation of the source text, but there are some minor differences in word choice and sentence structure. These differences are not significant enough to affect the overall meaning of the text.

**Reference translation:** The patients are not stabilised on site , but the emphasis is on fast transport to the emergency medical department , regardless of the condition .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Main differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""disease"" instead of ""patients"". This is not a perfect translation, as the word ""disease"" is not synonymous with ""patients"".
    * The machine translation uses the word ""high speed"" instead of ""fast transport"". This is also not a perfect translation, as ""high speed"" is not synonymous with ""fast transport"".
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation changes the sentence structure of the source text. The source text uses a compound sentence, while the machine translation uses two sentences.
    * The machine translation moves the phrase ""regardless of the condition"" to the end of the sentence. This is not a natural English phrasing.
* **Word order:**

The machine translation is not a perfect translation of the source text. It has made some errors in word choice, sentence structure and word order. The reference translation is a more accurate translation of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model

A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
## Evaluation of Estonian-English translation

**Step 1: Read the source text, machine translation and reference translation.**

**Source:** Sellest tulenevalt oli kaitsjatele soodsam, kui intensiivne lõunapäike paistaks neile küljelt.

**Machine translation:** As a result, it was more advantageous for the protectors to appear from their side on intensive lunch days.

**Reference translation:** As a result , it was more advantageous for the defenders if the intense midday sun would shine from their side .

**Step 2: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.**

**Main differences:**

* **Word choice:**
    * The machine translation uses the word ""protectors"" instead of ""defenders."" This is a closer translation of the Estonian word ""kaitsjad,"" but it does not capture the same sense of strength and determination as the word ""defenders.""
    * The machine translation uses the word ""lunch days"" instead of ""midday sun."" This is a more literal translation of the Estonian word ""päevalõud,"" but it does not flow as well as the reference translation.
* **Sentence structure:**
    * The machine translation uses a different sentence structure than the reference translation. The machine translation uses a simple sentence structure, while the reference translation uses a more complex sentence structure. This is because the machine translation is trying to be concise, while the reference translation is trying to be more precise.
* **Word order:**
    * The machine translation changes the order of some words in the sentence. This is because the machine translation is trying to make the sentence more grammatically correct.

**Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.**

The machine translation is well-written, but it does not capture the same sense of strength and determination as the reference translation. The word choice is not as precise, and the sentence structure is not as complex. The machine translation is also missing some of the nuances of the original text.

**Overall, the machine translation is a good translation, but it is not as high-quality as the reference translation.**
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format. <end_of_turn><start_of_turn>model
