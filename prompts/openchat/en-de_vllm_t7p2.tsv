 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Mehul behaves like a cool dude and all girls throng him.
Machine translation: Mehul benimmt sich wie ein cooler Kerl und alle Mädels drängen ihn.
Reference translation: Mehul benimmt sich wie ein cooler Kerl und alle Mädels drängen sich ihm auf.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation has ""alle Mädels drängen ihn"" (all girls throng him), while the reference translation has ""alle Mädels drängen sich ihm auf"" (all girls throng themselves onto him).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is slightly different from the reference translation in terms of the expression used for ""throng."" The reference translation uses a more specific expression, ""drängen sich ihm auf,"" which implies that the girls are actively approaching and gathering around Mehul. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses the more general expression, ""drängen ihn,"" which simply means that the girls are thronging him.
- The machine translation still conveys the main idea of the source text, but it lacks the specificity and nuance of the reference translation.

Step 4: Provide a conclusion based on the analysis.
- The quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using a more specific expression similar to the one used in the reference translation. Overall, the machine translation is understandable and conveys the main idea of the source text, but it could be more accurate and nuanced.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: They pleaded guilty to violating the federal Endangered Species Act.
Machine translation: Sie plädierten für schuldig, das Bundesgesetz über gefährdete Arten zu verletzen.
Reference translation: Sie bekannte sich schuldig , gegen das Bundesgesetz über gefährdete Arten verstoßen zu haben .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""für schuldig"" (for guilty), while the reference translation uses ""schuldig"" (guilty) directly.
- The machine translation uses ""das Bundesgesetz über gefährdete Arten zu verletzen"" (to violate the federal Endangered Species Act), while the reference translation uses ""gegen das Bundesgesetz über gefährdete Arten verstoßen zu haben"" (to have violated the federal Endangered Species Act).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the expression of guilt (""für schuldig"" vs. ""schuldig"") is a minor difference in meaning and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
- The difference in the expression of violation (""zu verletzen"" vs. ""zu haben verstoßen"") is a more significant difference. The reference translation uses the passive voice, which is more common in formal legal contexts. The machine translation uses the active voice, which is less formal.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in formality and expression compared to the reference translation. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using more formal language and better matching the structure of the reference translation.

Machine translation: Als nächstes eroberte Naiad eine französische Brig aus der Meerenge und einem holländischen Schleuder, auch aus der Meerenge, mit Medikamenten und Medikamenten.

Reference translation: Als nächstes eroberte Naiad einen französische Zweimaster und eine holländische Schaluppe aus der Meerenge . Beide Schiffe hatten Medikamente und Arzneimittel an Bord .

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, ""und einem holländischen Schleuder"" is used instead of ""eine holländische Schaluppe"" in the reference translation. ""Schleuder"" is not the correct term for a sloop, and ""Schaluppe"" is the correct term.
2. In the machine translation, ""mit Medikamenten und Medikamenten"" is used instead of ""Medikamente und Arzneimittel"" in the reference translation. ""Medikamenten"" is the plural form of ""Medikament,"" but ""Arzneimittel"" is the correct term for ""medicines.""
3. The machine translation does not mention that both ships had medicines and drugs on board, which is mentioned in the reference translation.

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has some errors in the choice of words and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation.

Source: The Tenth Doctor cringed at his fifth self's choice of wearing celery on his lapel.
Machine translation: Der zehnte Doktor kratzte vor der Wahl seines fünften Selbst, Sellerie auf seinem Revers zu tragen.
Reference translation: Der zehnte Doktor war angewidert von der Wahl seines fünften Selbst , Sellerie auf seinem Revers zu tragen .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: Der zehnte Doktor kratzte vor der Wahl seines fünften Selbst, Sellerie auf seinem Revers zu tragen.
- Reference translation: Der zehnte Doktor war angewidert von der Wahl seines fünften Selbst , Sellerie auf seinem Revers zu tragen .

Difference 1: The verb used in the machine translation is ""kratzte"" (scratched), while the verb used in the reference translation is ""war angewidert"" (was appalled).
Difference 2: The machine translation uses ""vor der Wahl"" (before the choice), while the reference translation uses ""von der Wahl"" (of the choice).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The verb ""kratzte"" does not accurately convey the meaning of ""cringed"" in the source text. The verb ""war angewidert"" in the reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text.
- The use of ""vor der Wahl"" in the machine translation changes the meaning of the sentence, making it less clear that the Tenth Doctor was appalled by his fifth self's choice. The use of ""von der Wahl"" in the reference translation is more accurate and clear.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of high quality, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and has some grammatical inaccuracies. The reference translation is a better representation of the source text and is of higher quality.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-German translation, I will first read and understand the source, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation to determine the quality of the machine translation.

Source: From that time she wore the 'rough homespun and brown scapular, white wimple and veil, leather belt with rosary, woollen 'stockings', rope sandals"".

Machine translation: Von da an trug sie den 'groben Homespun und braunen Scapular, weißes Wimple und Schleier, Ledergürtel mit Rosenkranz, Wollstrümpfe, Seilsandalen'.

Reference translation: Von dieser Zeit an trug sie das "" raue , hausgemachte und braune Skapulier , weiße Wimple und Schleier , Ledergürtel mit Rosenkranz , Wollstrümpfe , Seilsandalen "" .

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""Von da an"" while the reference translation uses ""Von dieser Zeit an"". Both phrases mean ""from that time"" or ""from that moment"" in English, so this difference does not affect the meaning.

2. The machine translation uses ""groben Homespun"" while the reference translation uses ""raue, hausgemachte"". Both phrases describe the same thing, which is ""rough, homemade"" in English. The difference is in the word order and the use of a comma in the reference translation.

3. The machine translation uses ""braunen Scapular"" while the reference translation uses ""braune Skapulier"". Both phrases mean ""brown scapular"" in English. The difference is in the word order and the use of the adjective ""braune"" in the reference translation.

4. The machine translation uses ""weißes Wimple"" while the reference translation uses ""weiße Wimple"". Both phrases mean ""white wimple"" in English. The difference is in the use of the adjective ""weißes"" in the machine translation and ""weiße"" in the reference translation.

5. The machine translation uses ""Schleier"" while the reference translation uses ""Schleier"". Both words mean ""veil"" in English, so there is no difference in meaning.

6. The machine translation uses ""Ledergürtel mit Rosenkranz"" while the reference translation uses ""Ledergürtel mit Rosenkranz"". Both phrases mean ""leather belt with rosary"" in English. There is no difference in meaning.

7. The machine translation uses ""Wollstrümpfe"" while the reference translation uses ""Wollstrümpfe"". Both words mean ""woollen stockings"" in English, so there is no difference in meaning.

8. The machine translation uses ""Seilsandalen"" while the reference translation uses ""Seilsandalen"". Both words mean ""rope sandals"" in English, so there is no difference in meaning.

In conclusion, the machine translation is of high quality, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is very close to the reference translation. There are only minor differences in word order and the use of adjectives, which do not affect the overall meaning.

2. The machine translation uses ""um ihn zu besiegen"" (to defeat him) while the reference translation uses ""um ihn zu besiegen"" (to defeat him).
3. The machine translation uses ""so den Segen von Brahma zu umgehen"" (to circumvent the boon of Brahma) while the reference translation uses ""umgeht so den Segen , den Brahma gegeben hat"" (circumvents the boon given by Brahma).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The difference in the verb form (""verkörpert sich"" vs. ""inkarniert sich"") is minor and does not significantly impact the meaning.
2. The difference in the verb form (""um ihn zu besiegen"" vs. ""um ihn zu besiegen"") does not impact the meaning.
3. The difference in the structure of the phrase (""so den Segen von Brahma zu umgehen"" vs. ""umgeht so den Segen , den Brahma gegeben hat"") slightly impacts the clarity of the translation. The machine translation's phrasing is less clear and may be confusing for some readers.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there is room for improvement in the clarity of the phrasing. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but not perfect.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-German translation, I will first read the source, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation to determine the quality of the translation.

Source: Abdallah Isaaq Deerow, 56, Somali politician, Constitution and Federalism Minister of Somalia, assassination.
Machine translation: Abdallah Isaaq Deerow, 56, somalischer Politiker, Minister für Verfassung und Föderalismus Somalias, Ermordung.
Reference translation: Abdallah Isaaq Deerow , 56 , somalischer Politiker , Minister für Verfassung und Föderalismus Somalias , Ermordung .

Upon analyzing the translations, I notice that the machine translation is almost identical to the reference translation. The only difference is the use of a period at the end of the reference translation, which is not necessary in German. Additionally, the reference translation has a slight formatting difference with the use of spaces around commas.

Considering these minor differences, I would say that the quality of the machine translation is very high. It accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is almost identical to the reference translation.

Source: Burke, as a Whig, did not wish to see an absolute monarchy again in France after the extirpation of Jacobinism.
Machine translation: Burke wollte als Whig nach der Extirpation des Jakobinismus in Frankreich keine absolute Monarchie mehr sehen.
Reference translation: Burke wollte als Whig nach der Ausrottung des Jakobinismus keine absolute Monarchie in Frankreich mehr sehen.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Extirpation"" while the reference translation uses ""Ausrottung"" for ""extirpation.""
2. The machine translation places ""in Frankreich"" after ""Frankreich"" while the reference translation places it after ""Monarchie.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. ""Extirpation"" and ""Ausrottung"" both mean ""extirpation"" or ""eradication,"" so this difference does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.
2. The placement of ""in Frankreich"" does not change the meaning of the sentence, but it may make the sentence sound more natural in German.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. However, there are minor differences in word choice and sentence structure that could be improved for better clarity and naturalness. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement.

Reference translation: 1863 popularisierten Lyells Geologische Evidenzen der Antike des Menschen die Vorgeschichte , obwohl seine Vorsicht vor der Evolution Darwin enttäuschte .

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""popularisierte"" (past tense) while the reference translation uses ""popularisierten"" (past perfect tense). The reference translation is more accurate as it conveys the idea that the book was published and then popularized.
2. The machine translation uses ""des Altertums"" (of antiquity) while the reference translation uses ""der Antike"" (of antiquity). Both translations are correct, but the reference translation is more common in German.
3. The machine translation places ""obwohl"" (though) before ""seine Vorsicht vor der Evolution Darwin enttäuschte"" (his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin), while the reference translation places it after ""Evolution Darwin enttäuschte"". The machine translation is less accurate in this case, as the placement of ""obwohl"" changes the meaning slightly.

Machine translation: Untere Stufe hat rusticated Piers mit gestauchten Obstkappen zu Sturz.
Reference translation: Die untere Stufe hat verrostete Pfeiler mit gezackten Fruchtkappen zum Sturz .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- ""Untere Stufe"" vs. ""Die untere Stufe"": The machine translation omits the definite article ""die"" before ""untere Stufe.""
- ""rusticated Piers"" vs. ""verrostete Pfeiler"": The machine translation uses ""rusticated Piers"" instead of ""verrostete Pfeiler."" ""Rusticated"" refers to a specific architectural style, while ""verrostete"" means ""rusticated"" or ""rusty.""
- ""mit gestauchten Obstkappen"" vs. ""mit gezackten Fruchtkappen"": The machine translation uses ""gestauchten Obstkappen"" instead of ""gezackten Fruchtkappen."" ""Gezackten Fruchtkappen"" refers to ""zigzagged fruit caps,"" while ""gestauchten Obstkappen"" could be translated as ""swagged fruit caps"" or ""pleated fruit caps.""
- ""zu Sturz"" vs. ""zum Sturz"": The machine translation uses ""zu Sturz"" instead of ""zum Sturz."" ""Zum Sturz"" is the correct preposition to use in this context.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it omits the definite article ""die"" and uses different terms for ""rusticated piers"" and ""fruit caps."" Additionally, it uses the incorrect preposition ""zu"" instead of ""zum."" The reference translation is more accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text more clearly.

Reference translation: Im März 1915 , nach dem Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges , trat Savige in die First Australian Imperial Force ein .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""ersten australische Kaisermacht"" instead of ""First Australian Imperial Force"" in the reference translation.
2. The machine translation uses ""trat ein"" instead of ""trat ein"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""First Australian Imperial Force"" as ""ersten australische Kaisermacht."" The correct translation should be ""First Australian Imperial Force"" or ""Ersten Australischen Imperial Force."" The use of ""Kaisermacht"" (empire) is incorrect, as the original term refers to a specific military force.
2. The machine translation correctly uses ""trat ein"" to indicate enlistment, which matches the reference translation.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Some disaffiliated along with Roman Catholics and other Christian groups in the wake of modern secularization.
Machine translation: Einige waren im Gefolge der modernen Säkularisierung zusammen mit Katholiken und anderen christlichen Gruppen desillusioniert.
Reference translation: Einige waren im Zuge der modernen Säkularisierung zusammen mit Katholiken und anderen christlichen Gruppen desillusioniert .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation and reference translation are almost identical, with only one minor difference:

Machine translation: Einige waren im Gefolge der modernen Säkularisierung zusammen mit Katholiken und anderen christlichen Gruppen desillusioniert.
Reference translation: Einige waren im Zuge der modernen Säkularisierung zusammen mit Katholiken und anderen christlichen Gruppen desillusioniert .

The difference is in the prepositional phrase ""im Gefolge der modernen Säkularisierung"" (in the wake of modern secularization) in the machine translation versus ""im Zuge der modernen Säkularisierung"" (in the wake of modern secularization) in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is very close to the reference translation, with only a slight difference in the choice of preposition. Both translations convey the same meaning, and the difference is minor. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is high.

Step 4: Provide a conclusion.

The machine translation is of high quality, as it is very close to the reference translation and conveys the same meaning. The minor difference in the choice of preposition does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: However he relocated noncombatant Boers—mostly women and children—into heavily guarded internment camps.
Machine translation: Allerdings verlagerte er nicht kämpferische Boers überwiegend Frauen und Kinder in stark bewachte Internierungslager.
Reference translation: Allerdings verlagerte er nicht kämpferische Buren , überwiegend Frauen und Kinder , in stark bewachte Internierungslager .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""Boers"" while the reference translation uses ""Buren.""
- The machine translation places a comma after ""kämpferische Buren"" and before ""überwiegend Frauen und Kinder,"" while the reference translation does not.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- ""Boers"" and ""Buren"" are two different terms for the same group of people. ""Boers"" is the English term, and ""Buren"" is the German term. The machine translation should have used ""Buren"" to match the reference translation.
- The comma placement in the machine translation is incorrect. The reference translation's comma placement is correct, as it separates the main clause from the additional information about the women and children.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has two errors: using ""Boers"" instead of ""Buren"" and incorrect comma placement. The reference translation is more accurate and should be used as the correct translation.

Reference translation: Im Juli 1915 , während der Yosemite-Untersuchung , nahm Charles Lewis Camp zwei Vielfraß gefangen , ein Männchen und ein Weibchen .

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""gefangen"" (caught) while the reference translation uses ""nahm"" (took). The verb ""nahm"" is more appropriate in this context as it implies that Charles Lewis Camp captured the wolverines.
2. The machine translation uses ""Wolverinen"" (wolverines) while the reference translation uses ""Vielfraß"" (martens). The reference translation is correct as ""Wolverinen"" is not a recognized term for wolverines in German.
3. The machine translation uses ""ein Mann und eine Frau"" (a man and a woman) while the reference translation uses ""ein Männchen und ein Weibchen"" (a male and a female). The reference translation is more accurate as it specifies the gender of the wolverines.

Machine translation: Nach dem Brand mit Chief American Horse an der Schlucht schickte Mills einen weiteren Boten, den dritten, nach Crook.
Reference translation: Nach dem Feuergefecht mit Chief American Horse an der Schlucht schickte Mills einen weiteren Boten , den dritten , nach Crook .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Brand"" (fire/blaze) while the reference translation uses ""Feuergefecht"" (firefight).
2. The machine translation uses ""den dritten"" (the third) while the reference translation uses ""den dritten"" (the third) as well.
3. The machine translation does not use a comma after ""Feuergefecht"" and before ""den dritten,"" while the reference translation does.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""Brand"" instead of ""Feuergefecht"" changes the meaning slightly, as ""Feuergefecht"" specifically refers to a firefight, while ""Brand"" could refer to a general fire or blaze. This is a minor difference, but it does affect the accuracy of the translation.
2. The use of ""den dritten"" is the same in both translations, so there is no difference here.
3. The lack of a comma in the machine translation could affect the readability and clarity of the sentence. The reference translation's use of a comma helps to separate the different parts of the sentence and makes it easier to understand.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in word choice and punctuation that affect the quality of the translation. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of ""allocate tenements as housing"" to the poorest blacks. It should have used ""teilen"" (share) instead of ""vergeben"" (allocate) to better convey the meaning.
2. The use of ""als Gehäuse"" (as housing) is not an accurate translation of ""as living space."" The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text.
3. The machine translation uses ""für die ärmsten Schwarzen"" (for the poorest blacks), which implies that the housing is given to the blacks, while the reference translation uses ""den ärmsten Schwarzen"" (the poorest blacks), which implies that the housing is shared with the poorest blacks.

Machine translation: Grabungen, Foxlöcher und andere Befestigungen wurden in der Regel für die spätere Wiederverwendung getarnt.
Reference translation: Gräben , Schützenlöcher und andere Befestigungsmöglichkeiten wurden in der Regel für die spätere Wiederverwendung getarnt .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Grabungen"" is used instead of ""Gräben"" in the reference translation. ""Grabungen"" means ""excavations"" in English, while ""Gräben"" means ""trenches.""
2. In the machine translation, ""Foxlöcher"" is used instead of ""Schützenlöcher"" in the reference translation. ""Foxlöcher"" means ""foxholes"" in English, while ""Schützenlöcher"" means ""sniper holes.""
3. The word order in the machine translation is slightly different from the reference translation. In the machine translation, ""und andere Befestigungen"" comes after ""Foxlöcher,"" while in the reference translation, ""und andere Befestigungsmöglichkeiten"" comes after ""Schützenlöcher.""

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The use of ""Grabungen"" instead of ""Gräben"" changes the meaning slightly, as trenches are a specific type of excavation, and the reference to trenches in the source is important for understanding the context.
2. The use of ""Foxlöcher"" instead of ""Schützenlöcher"" also changes the meaning, as foxholes are a more general term for small, dug-in shelters, while sniper holes are a specific type of foxhole used by snipers.
3. The word order difference in the machine translation may cause slight confusion for readers, as the reference to sniper holes comes after the reference to foxholes in the source.

Reference translation: Er trat 1994 bei WrestleMania X als Gastschiedsrichter für das WWF-Weltmeisterschaftsspiel im Schwergewicht zwischen Bret Hart und Yokozuna noch einmal auf .

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""trat er"" (he appeared) while the reference translation uses ""trat"" (he appeared). The machine translation is adding unnecessary pronouns.
2. The machine translation uses ""WWF World Heavyweight Championship Match"" while the reference translation uses ""WWF-Weltmeisterschaftsspiel im Schwergewicht"" (WWF Heavyweight World Championship match). The machine translation is more literal and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation.
3. The machine translation uses ""erneut"" (again) while the reference translation does not. This is a minor difference and does not significantly impact the meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation is more literal and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation in some instances. The reference translation is more concise and conveys the meaning more effectively.

3. Machine translation does not mention ""Motorräder"" (motorcycles) and ""Beiwagen"" (sidecars without a motor), while the reference translation does.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The use of ""Schnellstraße"" instead of ""speedway"" is a minor error, as both terms refer to a type of racing track. However, it is not an exact match.
2. The use of ""bietet Platz für"" instead of ""caters to"" changes the meaning slightly. ""Caters to"" implies that the speedway is specifically designed for these vehicles, while ""bietet Platz für"" simply means that these vehicles can be accommodated.
3. The omission of ""Motorräder"" and ""Beiwagen"" is a more significant error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. The source and reference translation specify that the speedway is for cars, motorcycles with and without sidecars. The machine translation only mentions cars, solos, and sidecars, which is not the same.

2. The difference in the translation of ""clarinet"" and ""cornet"" is more significant. The reference translation uses ""Kornett"" for ""cornet,"" which is the more accurate term in German. The machine translation uses ""Klarinette,"" which is the correct term for ""clarinet."" This discrepancy may cause confusion for readers who are familiar with the correct terms in German.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.
The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but there are some differences from the reference translation that may cause confusion for readers familiar with the correct terms in German. The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the translation of ""clarinet"" and ""cornet"" should be corrected to match the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is slightly off in its translation of the preposition. The correct preposition should be ""zum"" (to) instead of ""mit dem"" (with). The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text by using ""zum Außenministerium"" (to the Foreign Ministry), which is the correct translation for ""with the State Department.""

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it uses the wrong preposition. However, it still conveys the general meaning of the source text. The quality of the machine translation is moderate, as it is not completely incorrect but not entirely accurate either.

Reference translation: Seine Standhaftigkeit unter Feuer und im Chaos machte seine vorangegangene Melancholie und seine Defensivlosigkeit vor der Schlacht wett.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, the word ""büßte"" (atoned) is used, while the reference translation uses ""machte"" (made).
2. In the machine translation, the word ""für"" (for) is used before ""büßte,"" while the reference translation uses ""wett"" (compensated).
3. In the machine translation, the word ""ab"" (away) is used after ""büßte,"" while the reference translation does not use this word.
4. In the machine translation, the word ""ihre"" (their) is used before ""bisherige Melancholie"" (previous melancholy), while the reference translation uses ""seine"" (his).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""büßte"" instead of ""machte"" changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Büßte"" implies that the steadfastness under fire and amid chaos atoned for the previous melancholy and defensive lapses, while ""machte"" implies that the steadfastness under fire and amid chaos compensated for the previous melancholy and defensive lapses.
2. The use of ""für"" before ""büßte"" and ""wett"" after ""machte"" changes the structure of the sentence. The machine translation has a more passive voice, while the reference translation has an active voice.
3. The use of ""ab"" after ""büßte"" changes the meaning of the sentence. It implies that the steadfastness under fire and amid chaos atoned for the previous melancholy and defensive lapses completely, while the reference translation does not convey this sense of completion.
4. The use of ""ihre"" instead of ""seine"" changes the subject of the sentence. The machine translation refers to someone else's previous melancholy and defensive lapses, while the reference translation refers to the same person's previous melancholy and defensive lapses.

Reference translation: Matt sperrte Daniel dann wegen Jaywalking ein , während der Überfall vor sich ging , was ihn wütend machte .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""für Jaywalking"" while the reference translation uses ""wegen Jaywalking."" Both words mean ""because of"" or ""for"" in this context, but ""wegen"" is more specific to the reason for the detainment.
2. The machine translation uses ""wütete"" while the reference translation uses ""wütend machte."" Both words mean ""angry"" or ""infuriated,"" but ""wütend machte"" is in a passive voice, indicating that the action of becoming angry was caused by something else.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor differences from the reference translation. The use of ""für Jaywalking"" instead of ""wegen Jaywalking"" is a slight difference in word choice, but it does not significantly impact the overall meaning. The use of ""wütete"" instead of ""wütend machte"" is a more significant difference, as it changes the passive voice of the reference translation to an active voice. This change could slightly alter the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that Matt himself became angry, rather than being made angry by the situation.

Overall, the machine translation is of good quality, but it could be improved by using ""wegen Jaywalking"" and ""wütend machte"" to match the reference translation more closely.

Machine translation: Viele einflussreiche frühe amerikanische Siedler und schwarze Freimänner, darunter Jean Baptiste Point du Sable und W. E. B.
Reference translation: Viele einflussreiche frühe amerikanische Siedler und schwarze Ehrenbürger, darunter Jean Baptiste Point du Sable und W. E. B.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

Difference 1: ""schwarze Freimänner"" (machine translation) vs. ""schwarze Ehrenbürger"" (reference translation)
Difference 2: No other significant differences are present in the machine translation compared to the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Analysis: The machine translation is almost identical to the reference translation, with only one difference: ""schwarze Freimänner"" (free men) vs. ""schwarze Ehrenbürger"" (black honorary citizens). The reference translation seems to be more accurate, as it specifies that these individuals were ""black honorary citizens"" rather than just ""free men."" However, the machine translation is still quite good and conveys the main idea of the source text.

Quality evaluation: The machine translation is of high quality, with only a minor difference in the specificity of the description of the individuals mentioned. The overall meaning is still accurately conveyed, and the translation is very close to the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Lindwall returned in Australia's innings, batting at No.
Machine translation: Lindwall kehrte in Australiens Innings, Batting bei No.
Reference translation: Lindwall kehrte in Australiens Innings zurück und schlug mit der Nr .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""kehrte"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""kehrte"" is used. Both words mean ""returned"" in English, but the reference translation uses the past tense form, while the machine translation uses the present tense form.
2. In the machine translation, ""bei"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""mit der"" is used. Both prepositions can be used to indicate ""with"" in English, but ""mit der"" specifically refers to ""with the number"" in this context, while ""bei"" can be more general.
3. In the machine translation, ""Innings"" is written as ""Innings,"" while in the reference translation, it is written as ""Innings zurück."" The reference translation adds the word ""zurück,"" which means ""back"" in English, emphasizing that Lindwall returned to the game.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The use of the present tense form ""kehrte"" instead of the past tense form ""kehrte"" and the preposition ""bei"" instead of ""mit der"" make the machine translation less precise. Additionally, the omission of ""zurück"" in the machine translation makes it less clear that Lindwall returned to the game.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation.

133	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the English-German translation, which is given as below:
 To evaluate the quality of the English-German translation, I will compare the machine translation to the reference translation and identify any differences.

Source: Rivers and lakes are populated with pike, walleye, whitefish, rainbow, speckled, brown trout, and sturgeon.

Machine translation: Flüsse und Seen sind mit Hecht, Walleye, Weißfischen, Regenbogen, gesprenkelten, Bachforellen und Stör besiedelt.

Reference translation: Flüsse und Seen sind mit Hecht , Zander , Weißfischen , Regenbogen- , gesprenkelten und Bachforellen und Stör besiedelt .

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses a comma (,) to separate the fish species, while the reference translation uses a space and a comma ( , ).
2. The machine translation uses ""Regenbogen"" for ""rainbow,"" while the reference translation uses ""Regenbogen-"" with a hyphen.
3. The machine translation uses ""gesprenkelten"" for ""speckled,"" while the reference translation uses ""gesprenkelten"" with a space before the hyphen.
4. The machine translation uses ""Bachforellen"" for ""brown trout,"" while the reference translation uses ""Bachforellen"" with a space before the hyphen.

Overall, the machine translation is very close to the reference translation, with only minor differences in punctuation and the use of hyphens. The machine translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source text, and the differences do not significantly impact the quality of the translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: At the inaugural festival 'For The Hornets' headlined and the cathedral flew the pride rainbow flag.
Machine translation: Beim Eröffnungsfest ""For The Hornets"" flogen Headliner und die Kathedrale mit der stolzen Regenbogenfahne.
Reference translation: Beim Eröffnungsfest waren „ For The Hornets “ die Headliner und die Kathedrale hielt die Regenbogenfahne hoch .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""flogen"" (flew) is used, while in the reference translation, ""waren"" (were) is used.
2. In the machine translation, ""die Kathedrale mit der stolzen Regenbogenfahne"" (the cathedral with the proud rainbow flag) is used, while in the reference translation, ""die Kathedrale hielt die Regenbogenfahne hoch"" (the cathedral held the rainbow flag high) is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""flogen"" in the machine translation implies that both the headliner and the cathedral were flying the rainbow flag, while the reference translation suggests that the headliner was associated with ""For The Hornets"" and the cathedral held the rainbow flag high. The machine translation is less clear in this aspect.
2. The machine translation uses a more passive construction with ""mit der stolzen Regenbogenfahne"" (with the proud rainbow flag), while the reference translation uses an active construction with ""die Kathedrale hielt die Regenbogenfahne hoch"" (the cathedral held the rainbow flag high). The reference translation is more vivid and engaging.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is not as clear and engaging as the reference translation. The use of ""flogen"" and the passive construction in the machine translation make it less accurate and less clear than the reference translation. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is lower than the reference translation.

Machine translation: Die abgetrennten Schwänze der Leopardengeckos können bis zu 20 Minuten schwingen.
Reference translation: Die abgetrennten Schwänze von Leopardengeckos können bis zu 20 Minuten lang wackeln.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""schwingen"" (swing)
- Reference translation: ""wackeln"" (wiggle)

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation uses the verb ""schwingen"" (swing) instead of ""wackeln"" (wiggle) to describe the movement of the detached tails of leopard geckos.
- The verb ""wackeln"" is more appropriate in this context, as it specifically refers to a wiggling or wriggling motion, which is how the detached tails of leopard geckos move.
- The machine translation is not entirely incorrect, as ""schwingen"" can also refer to a wiggling motion in some contexts. However, it is less precise than the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by using the more specific verb ""wackeln"" instead of ""schwingen.""
- The overall meaning of the machine translation is still clear and understandable, but it is not as precise as the reference translation.

Machine translation: Sie könnten entweder mit den lokalen Fuchshunden oder, wenn weniger abenteuerlich, mit den Adler laufen.
Reference translation: Sie konnten entweder mit den örtlichen Rudeln von Fuchshunden oder , wenn auch weniger abenteuerlich , mit den Beagles rennen .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Adler"" (eagles) is used instead of ""Beagles"" in the reference translation.
2. In the machine translation, ""laufen"" (run) is used instead of ""rennen"" (run) in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""Adler"" instead of ""Beagles"" is a significant error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. The source text mentions ""beagles"" as an alternative to running with fox hounds, while the machine translation incorrectly suggests running with eagles.
2. The use of ""laufen"" instead of ""rennen"" is a minor error, as both words can be used to describe running. However, ""rennen"" is more appropriate in this context, as it conveys the idea of running with a pack of dogs more accurately.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some errors that affect the quality of the translation. The use of ""Adler"" instead of ""Beagles"" is a significant error that changes the meaning of the sentence, while the use of ""laufen"" instead of ""rennen"" is a minor error that does not significantly impact the overall meaning.

Source: Arthur resembles his brother, Andrew Blackthorn, albeit smaller and paler.
Machine translation: Arthur ähnelt seinem Bruder Andrew Blackthorn, wenn auch kleiner und blasser.
Reference translation: Arthur ähnelt seinem Bruder Andrew Blackthorn , wenn er auch kleiner und blasser wirkt .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation has an extra space before the comma after ""Andrew Blackthorn.""
- The machine translation does not include the word ""wirkt"" (appears) at the end of the sentence.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences on the quality of the translation.
- The extra space before the comma does not significantly impact the quality of the translation, as it is a minor formatting issue that does not change the meaning of the sentence.
- The omission of the word ""wirkt"" (appears) does impact the quality of the translation, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation implies that Arthur appears smaller and paler than his brother, while the machine translation simply states that Arthur is smaller and paler without implying any comparison to his brother.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.

Reference translation: Luthor setzt ihn dann einem Mineral aus dem Meteorit , Kryptonit , aus , das Superman stark schwächt .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses a comma to separate the phrase ""Meteorit Kryptonit"" from the rest of the sentence, while the reference translation uses a space.
2. The machine translation places the word ""aus"" after ""Kryptonit,"" while the reference translation places it before ""Meteorit.""
3. The machine translation does not include the word ""piece"" from the source, while the reference translation does.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of a comma in the machine translation is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
2. The placement of ""aus"" in the machine translation is a small error, but it does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
3. The omission of the word ""piece"" in the machine translation is a more significant issue, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. The source states that Superman is exposed to a mineral from a ""piece"" of a meteor, which implies a smaller, specific portion of the meteor.

2. In the machine translation, ""die Tribüne"" (the tribune) is used, while in the reference translation, ""die Galerie"" (the gallery) is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""unterbrechen"" (interrupt) instead of ""unterstreichen"" (emphasize) changes the meaning of the sentence. The source states that the mentioned figures punctuate the gallery, which means they emphasize or highlight it. The machine translation, however, suggests that they interrupt the tribune, which is not the intended meaning.
2. The use of ""die Tribüne"" (the tribune) instead of ""die Galerie"" (the gallery) also changes the meaning of the sentence. A tribune is a raised platform or stand, while a gallery is a long room or corridor with a series of arches or openings.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Mackrell pleaded not guilty to the two charges against him.
Machine translation: Mackrell plädierte auf nicht schuldig gegenüber den beiden Anklagen gegen ihn.
Reference translation: Mackrell bekannte sich den beiden Anklagen gegen ihn nicht schuldig.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: Mackrell plädierte auf nicht schuldig gegenüber den beiden Anklagen gegen ihn.
- Reference translation: Mackrell bekannte sich den beiden Anklagen gegen ihn nicht schuldig.

Differences:
1. ""plädierte auf nicht schuldig"" vs. ""bekannte sich nicht schuldig""
2. ""gegenüber den beiden Anklagen"" vs. ""den beiden Anklagen""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
1. In the machine translation, ""plädierte auf nicht schuldig"" is used, which means ""pleaded not guilty."" In the reference translation, ""bekannte sich nicht schuldig"" is used, which means ""denied guilt."" Although both phrases convey a similar meaning, they are not exactly the same.
2. In the machine translation, ""gegenüber den beiden Anklagen"" is used, which means ""against the two charges."" In the reference translation, ""den beiden Anklagen"" is used, which means ""the two charges."" The machine translation adds the word ""gegenüber,"" which is not necessary in this context.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences in word choice and phrasing compared to the reference translation. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using the same phrasing as the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: The Cardinals inducted Curt Flood, Bob Forsch, George Kissell and Ted Simmons into the franchise Hall of Fame.
Machine translation: Die Kardinäle induzierten Curt Flood, Bob Forsch, George Kissell und Ted Simmons in die Franchise Hall of Fame.
Reference translation: Die Cardinals haben Curt Flood , Bob Forsch , George Kissell und Ted Simmons in die Franchise Hall of Fame aufgenommen .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""induzierten"" (inducted) while the reference translation uses ""aufgenommen"" (admitted).
2. The machine translation omits the comma after ""Curt Flood"" and before ""Bob Forsch.""
3. The machine translation uses ""in die Franchise Hall of Fame"" while the reference translation uses ""in die Franchise Hall of Fame aufgenommen.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""inducted"" vs. ""admitted"" does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence, but ""aufgenommen"" (admitted) is more commonly used in this context in German.
2. The omission of the comma does not change the meaning of the sentence, but it is a minor grammatical error in the machine translation.
3. The machine translation omits the verb ""aufgenommen"" (admitted) from the sentence, which makes the meaning slightly different. In the reference translation, it is clear that the Cardinals admitted the players into the Hall of Fame, while the machine translation only states that they were inducted.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor errors and omissions that make it slightly different from the reference translation. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by addressing these issues.

Source: After firing fourteen shells, the fifteenth detonated in the right gun barrel in the center turret, destroying the gun.
Machine translation: Nach dem Abfeuern vierzehn Muscheln, zündete die fünfzehnte in der rechten Pistole Lauf in der Mitte Revolver, Zerstörung der Waffe.
Reference translation: Nach dem Abfeuern von vierzehn Kanonenkugeln detonierte die fünfzehnte im rechten Kanonenrohr im mittleren Geschützturm und zerstörte das Geschütz .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. Machine translation uses ""Muscheln"" (shells) while the reference translation uses ""Kanonenkugeln"" (cannonballs).
2. Machine translation uses ""Pistole Lauf"" (gun barrel) while the reference translation uses ""Kanonenrohr"" (cannon barrel).
3. Machine translation uses ""Revolver"" (revolver) while the reference translation uses ""Geschützturm"" (turret).
4. Machine translation uses ""Zerstörung der Waffe"" (destruction of the weapon) while the reference translation uses ""das Geschütz zerstörte"" (the gun was destroyed).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""Muscheln"" instead of ""Kanonenkugeln"" is a minor difference, as both terms refer to projectiles. However, ""Kanonenkugeln"" is more specific to the context of a gun or cannon.
2. The use of ""Pistole Lauf"" instead of ""Kanonenrohr"" is a more significant difference, as ""Pistole Lauf"" refers to a revolver barrel, while ""Kanonenrohr"" refers to a cannon barrel. This change in terminology alters the meaning of the sentence, as revolvers and cannons are different types of firearms.
3. The use of ""Revolver"" instead of ""Geschützturm"" is another significant difference. ""Revolver"" refers to a type of firearm, while ""Geschützturm"" refers to a turret on a vehicle or structure. This change in terminology also alters the meaning of the sentence.
4. The use of ""Zerstörung der Waffe"" instead of ""das Geschütz zerstörte"" is a minor difference in terms of meaning, as both phrases convey that the weapon was destroyed. However, the reference translation is more concise and direct.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of moderate quality, as it captures the general meaning of the source text but contains several significant inaccuracies in terminology. The translation would benefit from further refinement to ensure the correct use of firearm-related terms and to maintain the original meaning of the source text.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""romanerte"" is used, while ""umschnärmte"" is used in the reference translation. Both words mean ""wooed"" or ""courted"" in English, but ""umschnärmte"" is a more specific term for showering someone with affection and attention.
2. In the machine translation, ""davon zu überzeugen"" is used, while ""davon zu überzeugen"" is used in the reference translation. Both phrases mean ""to convince her,"" but the reference translation uses a more formal and precise expression.
3. In the machine translation, ""zusammen gehörten"" is used, while ""zusammen gehörten"" is used in the reference translation. Both phrases mean ""belonged together,"" but the reference translation uses a more formal and precise expression.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

In the machine translation, the word ""Palettenträger"" is used, while in the reference translation, the word ""Sargträger"" is used.

Step 3: Determine the meaning of the different words.

""Palettenträger"" means ""pallet carriers"" or ""pallet bearers"" in English, while ""Sargträger"" means ""coffin bearers"" or ""casket bearers"" in English.

Step 4: Compare the meanings to the source text.

The source text mentions ""pallbearers,"" which refers to people who carry a coffin or casket during a funeral. The machine translation's use of ""Palettenträger"" does not accurately convey this meaning, as it refers to people who carry pallets, not coffins or caskets.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is of low quality because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The use of ""Palettenträger"" instead of ""Sargträger"" leads to a misunderstanding of the context.

Step 6: Provide a recommendation for improvement.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-German translation, I will compare the machine translation and reference translation step by step.

1. ""2d Battalion"" vs. ""2d Bataillon"": Both translations correctly use the ordinal number ""2d"" (second) and the term ""Battalion""/""Bataillon"" in German.

2. ""redesignated as"" vs. ""neu benannt"": Both translations correctly convey the meaning of the original text, which is that the battalion was renamed.

3. ""2d Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment"" vs. ""2. Bataillon, 4. Infanterieregiment"": Both translations correctly translate the original text, indicating that the battalion is now part of the 4th Infantry Regiment. However, the reference translation uses the ordinal number ""4."" in the German text, while the machine translation uses the cardinal number ""4."". This is a minor difference, but it is important to note that the reference translation is more accurate in this case.

4. ""on 1 October 2005"" vs. ""am 1. Oktober 2005"": Both translations correctly convey the date mentioned in the original text.

Overall, the machine translation is very close to the reference translation and accurately conveys the meaning of the original text. The only difference is the use of the ordinal number in the German text, which is a minor issue. Therefore, I would consider the machine translation to be of high quality.

Machine translation: Hotel Monte Ne und Missouri Row beide mit Veranda 575 ft lang.
Reference translation: Hotel Monte Ne und Missouri Row verfügten beide über eine 575 ft lange Veranda .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""und"" (and) to connect the two hotel names, while the reference translation uses a comma followed by ""und"" (and).
- The machine translation uses ""mit"" (with) to describe the feature of the hotels, while the reference translation uses ""verfügten beide über"" (both had).
- The machine translation uses ""Veranda"" (porch), while the reference translation uses ""Veranda"" (veranda).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of ""und"" (and) to connect the hotel names is correct, as it is a common way to connect items in a list in German.
- The use of ""mit"" (with) to describe the feature of the hotels is not as clear as the reference translation. The reference translation more accurately conveys that both hotels had a veranda that was 575 ft long.
- The use of ""Veranda"" (porch) is correct, as it is the appropriate German translation for ""porch.""

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by using the same phrasing as the reference translation to more clearly convey that both hotels had a veranda that was 575 ft long.

Reference translation: Am 3. Juni 2010 klagte das U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama Van der Sloot wegen Erpressung und Leistungsbetrug an.

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""klagte"" (charged) while the reference translation uses ""klagte"" (charged) as well.
2. The machine translation uses ""Drahtbetrug"" (wire fraud) while the reference translation uses ""Leistungsbetrug"" (fraud).

Analysis:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with only a slight difference in the type of fraud mentioned. The machine translation correctly translates the date, the court, and the person charged. The only discrepancy is the type of fraud, where the machine translation uses ""Drahtbetrug"" (wire fraud) while the reference translation uses ""Leistungsbetrug"" (fraud). This difference may change the meaning of the sentence, as ""Drahtbetrug"" specifically refers to wire fraud, while ""Leistungsbetrug"" is a more general term for fraud.

Reference translation: Die beiden Männer kämpften miteinander und der viel stärkere amerikanische Ureinwohner überwältigte Mullan und ertränkte ihn beinahe.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""ergriff miteinander"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""kämpften miteinander."" The verb ""ergriff"" means ""grasped"" or ""seized,"" while ""kämpften"" means ""fought"" or ""wrestled."" The reference translation more accurately captures the sense of physical struggle in the source text.
2. In the machine translation, ""overpowering Mullan"" is translated as ""overpowering Mullan und fast ertrinken ihn."" The reference translation uses ""überwältigte Mullan,"" which more accurately conveys the idea of overpowering.
3. In the machine translation, ""fast ertrinken ihn"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""ertränkte ihn beinahe.""

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: In its trajectory, it ascends from the central quarter to the Sierra Nevada.
Machine translation: In seiner Flugbahn steigt er vom zentralen Viertel zur Sierra Nevada auf.
Reference translation: Sie führt vom Stadtzentrum hinauf zur Sierra Nevada.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: In seiner Flugbahn steigt er vom zentralen Viertel zur Sierra Nevada auf.
- Reference translation: Sie führt vom Stadtzentrum hinauf zur Sierra Nevada.

Differences:
1. ""In seiner Flugbahn"" (in its trajectory) vs. ""Sie führt"" (it leads)
2. ""steigt er vom zentralen Viertel"" (ascends from the central quarter) vs. ""vom Stadtzentrum hinauf"" (from the city center up)
3. ""zur Sierra Nevada"" (to the Sierra Nevada) is the same in both translations.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation uses ""In seiner Flugbahn"" (in its trajectory) instead of ""Sie führt"" (it leads), which is a less accurate translation of the source text. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text.
- The machine translation uses ""steigt er vom zentralen Viertel"" (ascends from the central quarter) instead of ""vom Stadtzentrum hinauf"" (from the city center up). The reference translation more accurately conveys the idea of the source text, which is about a path leading from the city center to the Sierra Nevada.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text and is more appropriate for the context.

Source: Some other later trilobites also lost facial sutures secondarily.
Machine translation: Einige andere später Trilobiten verloren auch Gesichtsnähte secondarily.
Reference translation: Einige andere spätere Trilobiten verloren ebenfalls sekundär Gesichtsnähte .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""Einige andere später"" while the reference translation uses ""Einige andere spätere"".
- The machine translation uses ""auch"" while the reference translation uses ""ebenfalls"".
- The machine translation uses ""secondarily"" while the reference translation uses ""sekundär"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the word order for ""other later"" is not significant and does not affect the meaning.
- The difference in the word used for ""also"" (auch vs. ebenfalls) is also not significant and does not affect the meaning.
- The difference in the word used for ""secondarily"" (secondarily vs. sekundär) is significant as it changes the meaning. ""Secondarily"" implies that the loss of facial sutures happened as a result of something else, while ""sekundär"" implies that it is a secondary characteristic or feature.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of high quality because it changes the meaning of the source text by using a different word for ""secondarily"". The other differences in word order and choice do not significantly affect the meaning, but the difference in ""secondarily"" vs. ""sekundär"" does.

Source: His disdain for the Copperheads contributed to his becoming a Republican after the war.
Machine translation: Seine Verachtung für die Kopfköpfe trug dazu bei, dass er nach dem Krieg Republikaner wurde.
Reference translation: Seine Verachtung für die Copperheads trug dazu bei , dass er nach dem Krieg Republikaner wurde .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

In the machine translation, the term ""Kopfköpfe"" is used, while in the reference translation, the term ""Copperheads"" is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

The term ""Copperheads"" is a specific historical reference to a group of Northern Democrats in the United States during the American Civil War who opposed the war and were critical of the Lincoln administration. The term ""Kopfköpfe"" is a more general term that translates to ""big heads"" or ""headstrong people"" in English.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate because it does not correctly translate the specific historical reference ""Copperheads"" to its correct term. The reference translation is more accurate in this regard.

Step 5: Provide a conclusion.

The quality of the English-German machine translation is not optimal in this case, as it does not correctly translate the specific historical reference ""Copperheads."" The reference translation is more accurate and should be considered the better translation.

Reference translation: Die Italiener protestierten energisch gegen die Gefangennahme von Đurišić , aber die Deutschen überstimmten sie .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""beherrschten sie"" (controlled them) is used, while in the reference translation, ""überstimmten sie"" (overruled them) is used.
2. The comma in the reference translation separates the two clauses more clearly, while the machine translation does not have a comma.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in verb choice (""beherrschten"" vs. ""überstimmten"") changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Beherrschten"" implies that the Germans controlled or dominated the Italians, while ""überstimmten"" implies that the Germans overruled the Italians' protest.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: Next, the bride wears the marriage clothes to the accompaniment of additional Veda mantras.
Machine translation: Als nächstes trägt die Braut die Hochzeitskleidung zur Begleitung weiterer Veda-Mantras.
Reference translation: Als nächstes trägt die Braut die Hochzeitskleidung zu zusätzlichen Veda-Mantras .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""zur Begleitung"" (to the accompaniment), while the reference translation uses ""zu"" (to) without ""Begleitung"" (accompaniment).
2. The machine translation uses ""weiterer"" (further), while the reference translation uses ""zusätzlichen"" (additional).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""zur Begleitung"" in the machine translation is not incorrect, but it is less concise than ""zu"" in the reference translation. The meaning is the same, but the reference translation is more direct and to the point.
2. The use of ""weiterer"" in the machine translation is not incorrect, but it is less precise than ""zusätzlichen"" in the reference translation. ""Weiterer"" implies that there were already some Veda mantras before, while ""zusätzlichen"" simply means additional, without implying anything about previous mantras.

Source: They wear ragged cloaks about their hunched bodies.
Machine translation: Sie tragen zerklüftete Umhänge an ihren gejagten Körpern.
Reference translation: Sie tragen zerlumpte Mäntel um ihre gebeugten Körper.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: zerklüftete Umhänge (ragged cloaks) vs. zerlumpte Mäntel (ragged mantles)
- Machine translation: gejagten Körpern (hunted bodies) vs. gebeugten Körper (bent bodies)

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the first part of the sentence (zerklüftete Umhänge vs. zerlumpte Mäntel) is a matter of word choice. Both ""Umhänge"" (cloaks) and ""Mäntel"" (mantles) can be considered appropriate translations for ""cloaks."" However, ""zerlumpte"" (ragged) is more appropriate for ""mantles"" than for ""cloaks.""
- The difference in the second part of the sentence (gejagten Körpern vs. gebeugten Körper) is also a matter of word choice. Both ""gejagten"" (hunted) and ""gebeugten"" (bent) can be considered appropriate translations for ""hunched."" However, ""gebeugten"" (bent) is more accurate in describing the physical appearance of the bodies, while ""gejagten"" (hunted) could imply that the bodies are being pursued or chased.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in word choice that make it less precise than the reference translation. The machine translation uses ""zerklüftete Umhänge"" (ragged cloaks) instead of ""zerlumpte Mäntel"" (ragged mantles), and ""gejagten Körpern"" (hunted bodies) instead of ""gebeugten Körper"" (bent bodies). These differences slightly alter the meaning of the sentence, making the machine translation less accurate than the reference translation.

Source: Throughout the battle, Marine artillerymen fired 158,891 mixed rounds.
Machine translation: Während der gesamten Schlacht feuerten Marine Artilleristen 158.891 gemischte Runden.
Reference translation: Während der gesamten Schlacht feuerten Marine-Artilleristen 158.891 gemischte Runden ab.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation has ""158.891"" while the source and reference translation have ""158,891"".
2. The machine translation has ""Während der gesamten Schlacht feuerten Marine Artilleristen"" while the reference translation has ""Während der gesamten Schlacht feuerten Marine-Artilleristen"".
3. The machine translation has ""gemischte Runden"" while the reference translation has ""gemischte Runden ab"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The difference in the number format (decimal point vs. comma) is likely due to a formatting issue in the machine translation. This does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. The difference in the wording for ""Marine artillerymen"" is minor. The machine translation uses ""Marine Artilleristen"" without the hyphen, while the reference translation uses ""Marine-Artilleristen"" with a hyphen. Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation is more accurate in terms of grammar.
3. The difference in the ending of the sentence (""Runden"" vs. ""Runden ab"") is significant. The reference translation includes the verb ""abfeuern"" (to fire off) in the phrase ""gemischte Runden ab"", which adds more clarity to the action of firing the rounds. The machine translation omits this verb, which makes the action less clear.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some issues with formatting and clarity. The formatting issue can be easily fixed, but the omission of the verb ""abfeuern"" in the machine translation makes the action less clear. The reference translation is more accurate and clear in conveying the meaning of the source text.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by including the verb ""abfeuern"" and maintaining the correct formatting for numbers.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: The average shooter can engage multiple targets faster than with a handgun.
Machine translation: Der durchschnittliche Shooter kann mehrere Ziele schneller als mit einer Waffe engagieren.
Reference translation: Der durchschnittliche Schütze kann mehrere Ziele schneller angreifen als mit einer Pistole.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Waffe"" (weapon) is used instead of ""Pistole"" (pistol) in the reference translation.
2. In the machine translation, ""engagieren"" (engage) is used instead of ""angreifen"" (attack) in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""Waffe"" instead of ""Pistole"" is less specific and could refer to any type of weapon, not just a handgun. This makes the machine translation less accurate than the reference translation.
2. The use of ""engagieren"" instead of ""angreifen"" changes the meaning slightly. ""Engagieren"" implies a more general interaction with the targets, while ""angreifen"" specifically implies attacking the targets. The reference translation is more accurate in conveying the intended meaning of the source.

Conclusion: The machine translation is less accurate than the reference translation due to the use of a less specific term for ""handgun"" and a slightly different meaning for the action of engaging targets.

2. The machine translation uses ""und die stellvertretende Kassiererin"" (and the deputy cashier) while the reference translation uses ""und die stellvertretende Kassiererin"" (and the assistant cashier). The meaning is the same, but the reference translation is more accurate to the source text.
3. The machine translation uses ""später nicht Pierpont nach seiner Verhaftung in Detroit zu identifizieren"" (later not to identify Pierpont after his arrest in Detroit) while the reference translation uses ""nicht identifizieren"" (not to identify). The machine translation is more literal, while the reference translation is more concise and natural.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences in word choice and phrasing compared to the reference translation. The quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by addressing the typo and using more natural phrasing.

 First, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""Er verkörpern sich selbst"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""Er entkörpert sich"" is used. The verb ""verkörpern"" means ""to embody"" or ""to incarnate,"" while ""entkörpert"" means ""disembodies"" or ""dissolves."" The reference translation uses the correct verb to convey the idea of the subject disembodying or dissolving itself.

2. In the machine translation, ""als sein Killing Curse, der Harry ins Visier nimmt, sich wieder auf ihn richtet"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""als sein Todesfluch , der auf Harry abzielt"" is used. The machine translation uses ""Killing Curse"" and ""nimmt ... ins Visier,"" which means ""takes ... into sight."" The reference translation uses ""Todesfluch"" and ""abzielt auf,"" which means ""targets."" The reference translation more accurately conveys the idea of the curse targeting Harry.

3. In the machine translation, ""und die Narbe auf Harrys Stirn lässt"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""und die Narbe auf Harrys Stirn hinterlässt"" is used. The machine translation uses ""lässt"" which means ""leaves"" or ""lets,"" while the reference translation uses ""hinterlässt"" which means ""leaves behind"" or ""remains."" The reference translation more accurately conveys the idea of the scar remaining on Harry's forehead.

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation more accurately conveys the idea of the subject disembodying itself, the curse targeting Harry, and the scar remaining on Harry's forehead.

Reference translation: Presleys Freund Marty Lacker betrachtete Parker als einen "" Schwindler und Trickbetrüger "" .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""hustler and a con artist"" while the reference translation uses ""Schwindler und Trickbetrüger"".
2. The machine translation does not include the word ""Trickbetrüger"" (trickster, swindler) from the reference translation.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation because it omits the word ""Trickbetrüger"" (trickster, swindler).

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: Die Spurs fegte die ersten beiden Runden der Playoffs.
- Reference translation: Die Spurs gewannen die ersten beiden Runden der Playoffs.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the verb used. In the machine translation, the verb ""fegte"" (swept) is used, while in the reference translation, the verb ""gewannen"" (won) is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The verb ""fegte"" (swept) in the machine translation implies that the Spurs won all the games in the first two rounds without any losses.
- The verb ""gewannen"" (won) in the reference translation implies that the Spurs won the first two rounds of the playoffs, but it does not necessarily mean they won all the games without any losses.

In this case, the machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it conveys a stronger meaning of the Spurs' victory in the first two rounds. The reference translation is more accurate, as it simply states that the Spurs won the first two rounds without implying that they swept all the games.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: She explained that Louise ""adores and idolises Peggy"", which resembles the actress' relationship with Windsor.
Machine translation: Sie erklärte, Louise ""verehrt und vergöttert Peggy"", was der Beziehung der Schauspielerin zu Windsor ähnelt.
Reference translation: Sie erklärte , Louise "" verehrt und vergöttert Peggy "" , was der Beziehung der Schauspielerin zu Windsor ähnelt .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation has a comma before ""was der Beziehung der Schauspielerin zu Windsor ähnelt,"" while the reference translation does not. This is a minor difference and does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

2. The machine translation has a space between ""Sie erklärte"" and ""Louise,"" while the reference translation does not. This is also a minor difference and does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is very close to the reference translation in terms of meaning and structure. The only differences are minor punctuation and spacing issues, which do not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation. Therefore, the quality of the English-German translation is high.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Camille Dodero, writing in The Village Voice opined that M.I.A.
Machine translation: Camille Dodero, schriftlich in The Village Voice entschied, dass M.I.A.
Reference translation: Camille Dodero, die in The Village Voice schrieb , meinte , dass M.I.A .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""schriftlich"" (in writing) while the reference translation uses ""die in The Village Voice schrieb"" (who wrote in The Village Voice).
2. The machine translation uses ""entschied"" (decided) while the reference translation uses ""meinte"" (thought/opined).
3. The machine translation does not include the comma after ""Camille Dodero"" and before ""schriftlich in The Village Voice entschied,"" while the reference translation does.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The use of ""schriftlich"" instead of ""die in The Village Voice schrieb"" changes the meaning slightly, as it implies that Camille Dodero wrote something down in The Village Voice, while the reference translation implies that Camille Dodero wrote for The Village Voice.
2. The use of ""entschied"" instead of ""meinte"" changes the tone of the translation. ""Entscheidet"" implies a more definitive decision, while ""meinte"" implies a more casual opinion.
3. The missing comma in the machine translation affects the readability and flow of the sentence, making it less natural in English.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of high quality, as it has several differences from the reference translation that affect the meaning, tone, and readability of the sentence.

Reference translation: Journalisten wurden vorgeladen , um in Fitzgeralds Ermittlungen der Grand Jury auszusagen

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""eingereicht"" vs. ""vorgeladen"": The machine translation uses ""eingereicht"" (submitted), while the reference translation uses ""vorgeladen"" (summoned).
2. ""großen Jury Untersuchung"" vs. ""Ermittlungen der Grand Jury"": The machine translation uses ""großen Jury Untersuchung"" (large jury investigation), while the reference translation uses ""Ermittlungen der Grand Jury"" (investigations of the grand jury).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. ""eingereicht"" vs. ""vorgeladen"": The use of ""eingereicht"" in the machine translation is not accurate, as it implies that the journalists were submitted or filed something, rather than being summoned to testify. The reference translation's ""vorgeladen"" is more accurate in this context.
2. ""großen Jury Untersuchung"" vs. ""Ermittlungen der Grand Jury"": The machine translation's ""großen Jury Untersuchung"" is not a clear or accurate translation of the source text.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has two minor inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The first inaccuracy is the use of ""Kindermord"" instead of ""Kindsmords,"" and the second inaccuracy is the omission of the phrase ""through it"" in ""Vaterschaft durch sie ungewiss wird."" These inaccuracies slightly reduce the quality of the machine translation.

Overall, the machine translation is of good quality but could be improved by addressing the identified inaccuracies.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: In May 2011, Danson teased an ""exciting"" upcoming storyline involving Leanne.
Machine translation: Im Mai 2011, Danson neckte eine ""spannende"" kommenden Storyline mit Leanne.
Reference translation: Im Mai 2011 neckte Danson eine "" aufregende "" bevorstehende Geschichte mit Leanne .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation uses ""spannende"" (exciting) while the reference translation uses ""aufregende"" (upsetting, agitating).
- Machine translation uses ""kommenden Storyline"" (upcoming storyline) while the reference translation uses ""bevorstehende Geschichte"" (forthcoming story).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the adjective used to describe the storyline (""spannende"" vs. ""aufregende"") changes the tone of the translation. The reference translation suggests that the storyline is upsetting or agitating, while the machine translation suggests that it is exciting.
- The difference in the phrase used to describe the storyline (""kommenden Storyline"" vs. ""bevorstehende Geschichte"") changes the specificity of the translation. The machine translation is more general, while the reference translation is more specific.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.
The overall quality of the machine translation is not very high. The differences in tone and specificity between the machine translation and the reference translation make the machine translation less accurate.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: After the move floundered as quickly as it arose, Hamilton quickly rejoined the League.
Machine translation: Nachdem der Umzug so schnell, wie es aufkam, floundered, Hamilton schnell wieder in die Liga.
Reference translation: Nachdem der Schachzug so schnell ins Schwimmen geriet , wie er aufgekommen war , wechselte Hamilton schnell wieder in die Liga .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""der Umzug"" (the move) while the reference translation uses ""der Schachzug"" (the chess move).
2. The machine translation uses ""floundered"" while the reference translation uses ""ins Schwimmen geriet"" (got into swimming).
3. The machine translation uses ""wieder in die Liga"" (back into the league) while the reference translation uses ""wieder in die Liga"" (back into the league).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""der Umzug"" instead of ""der Schachzug"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""der Umzug"" refers to a move or relocation, while ""der Schachzug"" refers to a chess move. This is a significant difference in meaning.
2. The use of ""floundered"" instead of ""ins Schwimmen geriet"" also changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Floundered"" means to struggle or falter, while ""ins Schwimmen geriet"" means to get into swimming or to recover quickly. This is another significant difference in meaning.
3. The use of ""wieder in die Liga"" is the same in both translations, so there is no difference here.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of low quality because it significantly deviates from the reference translation in meaning. The use of ""der Umzug"" and ""floundered"" instead of ""der Schachzug"" and ""ins Schwimmen geriet"" changes the meaning of the sentence and does not accurately convey the original message.

310	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the English-German translation, which is given as below:
 First, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""Dieses Feuer fesselte die Konföderierten"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""Dieses Feuer traf die Konföderierten"" is used. The verb ""fesselte"" (pinned down) is different from ""traf"" (hit).
2. In the machine translation, ""während das massenhafte V-Korps der Infanterie organisierte"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""sich das massierte V-Infanteriekorps organisierte"" is used. The verb ""organisierte"" (organized) is the same, but the structure of the sentence is slightly different.
3. In the machine translation, ""um die linke Flanke des Konföderats anzugreifen"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""um die linke Flanke der Konföderierten anzugreifen"" is used. The difference is in the use of the possessive adjective ""des"" (of the) versus ""der"" (of the).

Now, let's evaluate the quality of the machine translation:

1. The use of ""fesselte"" instead of ""traf"" changes the meaning slightly. ""Fesselte"" implies that the fire kept the Confederates in one place, while ""traf"" implies that the fire hit the Confederates. This difference in meaning could affect the overall understanding of the sentence.
2. The structure of the sentence in the machine translation is slightly different from the reference translation, which could make it less clear to a native German speaker.
3. The use of ""des Konföderats"" instead of ""der Konföderierten"" is a minor error, but it still changes the meaning slightly. ""Des Konföderats"" implies that the left flank belongs to the Confederacy as a whole, while ""der Konföderierten"" implies that the left flank belongs to the Confederate side in the battle.

Overall, the machine translation is of moderate quality. It conveys the general meaning of the source text, but there are some differences in meaning and structure that could affect the understanding of a native German speaker. The translation could be improved by using the same verbs and possessive adjectives as the reference translation, and by maintaining the same sentence structure.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The missing hyphens in the machine translation make it less clear that the names ""Gyeongju-Choe"" and ""Lee-Clans"" are compound words. This could lead to confusion for the reader.
2. The placement of ""auch"" in the machine translation slightly changes the emphasis of the sentence, but the overall meaning remains the same. This difference is minor and does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.
3. The use of ""zu"" instead of ""auf"" in the machine translation is a more significant difference. ""Zu"" implies a movement towards or direction, while ""auf"" implies a connection or relationship. The reference translation's use of ""auf"" is more appropriate in this context, as it emphasizes the connection between the clans' ancestry and the Silla elites.

2. The machine translation uses ""die Double Eviction"" while the reference translation uses ""den Doppel-Auszug"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
1. The use of ""der"" vs. ""dem"" in the machine translation is incorrect. In German, ""Live Eviction"" is a compound noun, so it should be treated as a single unit and thus require the ""dem"" form.
2. The use of ""die"" vs. ""den"" in the machine translation is also incorrect. ""Double Eviction"" is a compound noun in English, but in German, it should be translated as ""Doppel-Auszug"", which is a compound noun and should be treated as a single unit. Therefore, it should be followed by ""den"" instead of ""die"".

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has some errors in the grammatical gender and case agreement. However, the overall meaning is still understandable.

- The machine translation has ""gewann Muifa die Taifun-Intensität"" while the reference translation has ""erlangte Muifa wieder Taifun-Intensität.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the date format is minor and does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
- The difference in the verb usage is more significant. The machine translation uses ""gewann"" (won), while the reference translation uses ""erlangte"" (achieved/obtained). Both verbs convey the idea of regaining, but ""erlangte"" is more specific to the context of regaining typhoon intensity.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in the verb usage that make it slightly less precise than the reference translation. The overall meaning is still clear, but the reference translation is more specific to the context.

Machine translation: Gen. Jacob D. Cox von der Kanawha Division als Kommandant des Korps, beerdigt das Korps durch ihn.
Reference translation: Gen. Jacob D. Cox von der Kanawha Division als Kommandant des Korps , der durch ihn Befehle an das Korps weiterleitet .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""beerdigt das Korps durch ihn"" (buries the corps through him) is used, while the reference translation has ""der durch ihn Befehle an das Korps weiterleitet"" (who channels orders to the corps through him).
2. The machine translation omits the word ""who"" (der) in the reference translation, which is important for understanding the sentence structure.

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. The phrase ""beerdigt das Korps durch ihn"" (buries the corps through him) does not accurately represent the meaning of ""funneling orders to the corps through him."" Additionally, the omission of the word ""who"" (der) in the machine translation makes the sentence structure unclear.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the English-German translation.

The quality of the English-German translation in the machine translation is poor. The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and has an incorrect sentence structure. The reference translation is more accurate and provides a clearer understanding of the source text.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: 2 Troop and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead.
Machine translation: 2 Truppe und Kommandozentrale würden den Strandkopf sichern.
Reference translation: 2 Truppen- und Kommandozentralen würden den Brückenkopf sichern.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Truppe"" is used instead of ""Truppen-"" in the reference translation.
2. In the machine translation, ""Kommandozentrale"" is used instead of ""Kommandzentralen"" in the reference translation.
3. In the machine translation, ""Strandkopf"" is used instead of ""Brückenkopf"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""Truppe"" instead of ""Truppen-"" is a minor error, as both words are related to troops. However, the reference translation is more specific and accurate in this context.
2. The use of ""Kommandozentrale"" instead of ""Kommandzentralen"" is a more significant error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Kommandzentralen"" refers to multiple command centers, while ""Kommandozentrale"" refers to a single command center. This error affects the overall quality of the machine translation.
3. The use of ""Strandkopf"" instead of ""Brückenkopf"" is another significant error. ""Strandkopf"" refers to the tip of a beach, while ""Brückenkopf"" refers to a beachhead, which is a term used in military strategy to describe a foothold established on enemy territory.

- The machine translation includes ""Muriquis"" while the reference translation does not.

Now, I will analyze the quality of the machine translation based on these differences:

1. The use of ""brachiaten"" instead of ""hangeln"" might not be the most accurate translation for ""brachiate"" in this context. ""Brachiating"" refers to the specific way of moving through trees by swinging from branch to branch, while ""hangeln"" is a more general term for hanging or swinging. This difference could lead to a slight loss in accuracy.
2. The inclusion of ""Muriquis"" in the machine translation is not an error, as it is also a type of primate mentioned in the source text. However, it is worth noting that the reference translation omits this species, which could be considered a minor inconsistency.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text. However, the use of ""brachiaten"" instead of ""hangeln"" and the inclusion of ""Muriquis"" could lead to a slight loss in accuracy. The quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement.

Machine translation: Grant marschierte nach Westen, um Lees Rückzug zu stilisieren, während Lincoln in Richmond blieb.
Reference translation: Grant marschierte nach Westen , um Lees Rückzug zu behindern , während Lincoln in Richmond blieb .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""stilisieren"" (stylize) instead of ""behindern"" (hinder) in the first part of the sentence.
- The machine translation uses a comma instead of a space before the period.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.
- The use of ""stilisieren"" instead of ""behindern"" changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Stilisieren"" means to give a particular style or form to something, while ""behindern"" means to hinder or impede. This difference in meaning could lead to misunderstanding.
- The use of a comma instead of a space before the period is a minor formatting issue and does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.
The overall quality of the machine translation is not high due to the change in meaning caused by the incorrect use of ""stilisieren"" instead of ""behindern."" The formatting issue with the comma is a minor issue that does not significantly impact the translation's quality.

3. The machine translation uses ""Bewachung des Kreml"" (guarding the Kremlin) while the reference translation uses ""den Kreml bewachen"" (guarding the Kremlin). Both phrases convey the same meaning, so this difference is not significant.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. However, there are some minor differences in word choice and sentence structure that make the reference translation slightly better. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by following the reference translation's structure more closely.

Machine translation: Als Vergeltung für die spätere Maroonierung auf einer einsamen Insel kehrt er zurück und entführt Kasey, um Zarya und Kitty in eine Falle zu locken.

Reference translation: Als Vergeltung dafür , dass er später auf einer einsamen Insel zurückgelassen wurde , kehrt er zurück und entführt Kasey , um Zarya und Kitty in eine Falle zu locken .

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""für die spätere Maroonierung"" (for the later marooning), while the reference translation uses ""dafür , dass er später auf einer einsamen Insel zurückgelassen wurde"" (for the fact that he was later left on a deserted island). The reference translation provides more context and is more accurate.

2. The machine translation omits the comma after ""Kasey"" in the sentence ""er kehrt zurück und entführt Kasey, um Zarya und Kitty in eine Falle zu locken."" The reference translation includes the comma, which is necessary for clarity.

Machine translation: Die Rotrückenspinne trumpt dann das Opfer mit Seide.
Reference translation: Die Rotrückenspinne wickelt dann das Opfer mit Seide ein.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""trumpt""
- Reference translation: ""wickelt ein""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation uses the verb ""trumpt,"" which is not the correct translation for ""trusses"" in this context. The correct translation should be ""wickelt"" (to wrap or envelop).
- The machine translation also omits the preposition ""ein,"" which is necessary to convey the meaning of ""wrapping"" or ""enveloping"" the victim.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is not accurate, as it uses an incorrect verb and omits a necessary preposition.
- The overall meaning of the sentence is not clearly conveyed in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The quality of the English-German machine translation is poor, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and provides a clearer understanding of the source text.

Reference translation: Im Juni überwogen Angriffe auf Flugplätze und Positionen der britischen Armee , aber am 14. Juni half sie bei Angriffen auf den Konvoi Vigorous .

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""dominierten"" (dominated) while the reference translation uses ""überwogen"" (preponderated). Although both words convey a similar meaning, ""überwogen"" is more accurate in this context as it implies that these attacks were more common or frequent.

2. The machine translation uses ""starken Konvoi"" (strong convoy) while the reference translation uses ""Konvoi Vigorous."" The reference translation is more accurate as it specifies the name of the convoy (Vigorous) instead of just describing it as strong.

3. The machine translation uses ""unterstützten"" (supported) while the reference translation uses ""half"" (helped). Both words convey a similar meaning, but ""half"" is more accurate in this context as it implies direct assistance in the attacks.

- ""marschiert Curtin in den Unterpinsel"" vs ""drängt Curtin ins Unterholz""
- ""wo er ihn punktlos schießt"" vs ""wo er ihn aus nächster Nähe erschießt""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- ""marschiert Curtin in den Unterpinsel"" vs ""drängt Curtin ins Unterholz"": The machine translation uses ""marschiert"" (marches) while the reference translation uses ""drängt"" (pushes/forces). The machine translation also uses ""Unterpinsel"" (underbrush) while the reference translation uses ""Unterholz"" (underbrush). These differences change the tone and action of the sentence, making it less aggressive in the machine translation.
- ""wo er ihn punktlos schießt"" vs ""wo er ihn aus nächster Nähe erschießt"": The machine translation uses ""punktlos schießt"" (shoots point blank) while the reference translation uses ""aus nächster Nähe erschießt"" (shoots from close range). These phrases have similar meanings, but the reference translation is more specific and descriptive.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Reference translation: Im Frühjahr erreichte die erste Singleauskopplung „ Hair Braider “ ihren Höhepunkt mit Platz

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Werbe-Single"" (promotional single) while the reference translation uses ""Singleauskopplung"" (single extraction).
2. The machine translation does not mention the peak position (""mit Platz"" in the reference translation), while the reference translation does.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The use of ""Werbe-Single"" instead of ""Singleauskopplung"" is a minor difference, as both terms refer to a promotional single. However, ""Singleauskopplung"" is more specific and accurate in this context.
2. The omission of the peak position in the machine translation is a more significant difference. This information is important for understanding the success of the single, and its absence in the machine translation makes it less informative than the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the type of legume mentioned (cowpeas vs. rubber beans) could be due to a misunderstanding in the machine translation. Cowpeas are more commonly known as ""Kuhbohnen"" in German, while ""Kautschukerbsen"" refers to rubber beans, which are not the same thing.
- The use of commas instead of periods after the numbers is a minor grammatical difference that does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there is a significant error in the translation of ""cowpeas"" to ""Kautschukerbsen."" This error affects the quality of the translation, as the two legumes are not the same. Additionally, the use of commas instead of periods after the numbers is a minor grammatical error that does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good but not perfect, as it contains a significant error in the translation of the type of legume mentioned and a minor grammatical error.

2. The only difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the presence of a comma after ""Jötunheimr"" in the reference translation. This difference is minor and does not significantly impact the overall meaning or quality of the translation.

Based on this analysis, I would say that the quality of the English-German translation is high. The machine translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is very close to the reference translation. The only minor difference is the presence of a comma in the reference translation, which does not significantly impact the overall meaning or quality of the translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: A Course in Thermodynamics, Blaisdell Publishing Company, Waltham MA.
Machine translation: Ein Kurs in Thermodynamik, Blaisdell Verlag, Waltham MA.
Reference translation: Ein Kurs in Thermodynamik , Blaisdell Verlag , Waltham MA .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation is: ""Ein Kurs in Thermodynamik, Blaisdell Verlag, Waltham MA.""
The reference translation is: ""Ein Kurs in Thermodynamik , Blaisdell Verlag , Waltham MA.""

The only difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of a comma after ""Blaisdell Verlag"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the significance of the difference.

The use of a comma after ""Blaisdell Verlag"" in the reference translation is a minor punctuation difference that does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. It is possible that the reference translation is more accurate, as it follows the standard German punctuation rules, which typically use a comma to separate the publisher's name from the rest of the address. However, the machine translation is still understandable and conveys the same information as the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Considering the minor punctuation difference, the machine translation is of high quality. It accurately translates the source text and conveys the same information as the reference translation. The only difference is the use of a comma, which does not significantly impact the overall meaning or understanding of the sentence.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Reference translation: Klassischer Stil mit verputztem Mauerwerk und Schieferdach hinter dem originalen Balkon mit Brüstung .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. ""gerenderten Mauerwerk"" vs. ""verputztem Mauerwerk"": The machine translation uses ""gerenderten"" (rendered) while the reference translation uses ""verputztem"" (plastered) for brickwork.
2. ""Schiefer Dach"" vs. ""Schieferdach"": The machine translation uses ""Schiefer Dach"" (slate roof) while the reference translation uses ""Schieferdach"" (slate roof).
3. ""original Balustraded Parapet"" vs. ""originalen Balkon mit Brüstung"": The machine translation uses ""original Balustraded Parapet"" while the reference translation uses ""originalen Balkon mit Brüstung"" (original balcony with balustrade).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""gerenderten"" (rendered) instead of ""verputztem"" (plastered) for brickwork is a minor difference, as both terms can be used to describe the same type of brickwork. However, ""verputztem"" is more common in this context.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the translation of ""the other curate"" to ""das andere Kurat"" and ""der andere Prädikant"" is due to the different gender and case agreements in German. ""Kurat"" is a masculine noun, while ""Prädikant"" is a masculine noun as well. The reference translation uses the correct gender agreement with ""der"" (masculine definite article) and ""Prädikant."" The machine translation incorrectly uses the neuter definite article ""das."" This is a minor error, but it does affect the quality of the translation.
2. The translation of ""the Auxiliaries"" to ""die Auxiliäre"" is correct, as ""Auxiliaries"" is a plural feminine noun in German.

Source: Most colleges and universities in the Philippines follows the traditional mortarboard, hood and gown during graduation.
Machine translation: Die meisten Hochschulen und Universitäten auf den Philippinen folgen der traditionellen Mortarboard, Kapuze und Kleid während der Graduierung.
Reference translation: Die meisten Hochschulen und Universitäten auf den Philippinen folgen der traditionellen Doktorhüten , Kapuzen und Gewändern während der Graduierung .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""mortarboard"" is translated as ""Kapuze,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""Doktorhüten.""
2. In the machine translation, ""gown"" is translated as ""Kleid,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""Gewänder.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The translation of ""mortarboard"" as ""Kapuze"" is incorrect, as ""mortarboard"" refers to the flat square cap worn by graduates, while ""Kapuze"" refers to a hood or cape. The reference translation correctly translates ""mortarboard"" as ""Doktorhüten,"" which is a more accurate term for the cap worn by graduates.
2. The translation of ""gown"" as ""Kleid"" is also incorrect, as ""gown"" refers to a long, loose-fitting robe worn by graduates, while ""Kleid"" refers to a dress or gown in general. The reference translation correctly translates ""gown"" as ""Gewänder,"" which is a more accurate term for the robe worn by graduates.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: It staged through to Ryebitsy, and bombed Dno on 30 August.
Machine translation: Es inszenierte durch Ryebitsy und bombardierte Dno am 30. August.
Reference translation: Es schritt bis Ryebitsy voran und bombardierte Dno am 30. August .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- ""inszenierte"" (staged) vs. ""schritt"" (stepped)
- ""durch"" (through) vs. ""bis"" (until)
- ""bombardierte"" (bombed) is the same in both translations.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- ""inszenierte"" vs. ""schritt"": The verb ""inszenierte"" (staged) implies that some kind of performance or show took place, while ""schritt"" (stepped) simply means that something moved forward. The source seems to be talking about movement, not a performance, so ""schritt"" is more appropriate.
- ""durch"" vs. ""bis"": ""durch"" (through) implies that the action continued past Ryebitsy, while ""bis"" (until) implies that the action stopped at Ryebitsy. The source seems to be talking about moving past Ryebitsy, so ""durch"" is more appropriate.

Step 4: Determine the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has some inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The use of ""inszenierte"" instead of ""schritt"" and ""durch"" instead of ""bis"" make the machine translation less accurate. However, the overall meaning of the sentence is still understandable.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is moderate. It conveys the general meaning of the source, but there are some inaccuracies in the choice of words.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: Später rekrutierte er die zweiten Abgesandten des Bösen in einer Handlung der Rache gegen Dareteufel für frühere Niederlagen.
Reference translation: Später rekrutierte er die zweiten Abgesandten des Bösen in einem Komplott der Rache gegen Daredevil für frühere Niederlagen.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Handlung"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""Komplott"" is used.
2. In the machine translation, ""Dareteufel"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""Daredevil"" is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. ""Handlung"" (action) vs. ""Komplott"" (plot): The machine translation uses ""Handlung"" to describe the plan of revenge, while the reference translation uses ""Komplott."" The difference here is subtle, but ""Komplott"" implies a more complex and secretive plan, which is more accurate in this context.
2. ""Dareteufel"" vs. ""Daredevil"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Daredevil"" as ""Dareteufel,"" which means ""Devil of Dare"" in German. This is a significant error, as it changes the meaning of the name and does not accurately represent the source text.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: On 5 October 1594 the Portuguese abandoned Kandy, and with the Empress they began their retreat towards the Balana fortalice.
Machine translation: Am 5. Oktober 1594 verließen die Portugiesen Kandy, und mit der Kaiserin begannen sie ihre Exerzitien in Richtung Balana-Festung.
Reference translation: Am 5. Oktober 1594 verließen die Portugiesen Kandy , und mit der Kaiserin begannen mit der Kaiserin ihren Rückzug in Richtung Balana Fortalice .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Exerzitien"" (exercises) instead of ""Rückzug"" (retreat) in the context of the Portuguese beginning their retreat.
2. The machine translation omits the repetition of ""mit der Kaiserin"" (with the Empress) in the reference translation.
3. The machine translation uses ""Festung"" (fortress) instead of ""Fortalice"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The use of ""Exerzitien"" instead of ""Rückzug"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""Exerzitien"" implies a period of spiritual exercises or retreat, while ""Rückzug"" refers to a withdrawal or retreat.
2. The omission of the repetition of ""mit der Kaiserin"" in the machine translation makes the sentence less clear, as it removes the emphasis on the Empress's involvement in the retreat.
3. The use of ""Festung"" instead of ""Fortalice"" is a minor difference, as both words refer to a fortified structure. However, ""Fortalice"" is a specific term used in the source, and its translation should be consistent with the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of moderate quality, as it captures the general meaning of the source but has some inaccuracies in the choice of words and the structure of the sentence.

The reference translation more accurately conveys the meaning of the source text, as it refers to Uleki transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, not just moving or migrating.

2. In the machine translation, ""in einen extratropen Zyklon"" is used, which means ""into an extratropical cyclone."" In the reference translation, ""zu einem außertropischen Wirbelsturm"" is used, which means ""to an extratropical storm."" The reference translation is more accurate, as it specifies that Uleki became an extratropical storm, not just a cyclone.

Source: The superior cavity opens into the lumen of the small intestine.
Machine translation: Der überlegene Hohlraum öffnet sich in das Lumen des Dünndarms.
Reference translation: Der Ober-Hohlraum öffnet sich in das Lumen des Dünndarms.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""überlegene"" (superior) while the reference translation uses ""Ober-"" (upper).
- The machine translation uses ""Hohlraum"" (cavity) while the reference translation uses ""Ober-Hohlraum"" (upper cavity).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the adjective used to describe the cavity (superior vs. upper) does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both adjectives can be used to describe the cavity's position relative to the small intestine.
- The difference in the noun phrase (Hohlraum vs. Ober-Hohlraum) is more significant. The reference translation uses a compound noun (Ober-Hohlraum) to emphasize the upper position of the cavity. The machine translation does not use the compound noun, which may result in a less precise translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the precision of the reference translation due to the omission of the compound noun ""Ober-Hohlraum.""

449	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the English-German translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: England replied with 330, and Australia scored 433 in the second innings.
Machine translation: England antwortete mit 330, und Australien erzielte 433 in der zweiten Innings.
Reference translation: England antwortete mit 330 , und Australien erzielte 433 im zweiten Innings .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""in der zweiten Innings"" while the reference translation uses ""im zweiten Innings"" for ""in the second innings.""
- The machine translation uses a comma after ""England antwortete mit 330"" while the reference translation does not.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the use of ""in der zweiten Innings"" vs. ""im zweiten Innings"" is a minor grammatical difference in German. Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation is more grammatically correct.
- The difference in the use of a comma after ""England antwortete mit 330"" is also a minor difference in punctuation. The machine translation includes the comma, while the reference translation does not. Both translations are still understandable, and the inclusion of the comma in the machine translation does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
Overall, the machine translation is of good quality. The differences identified are minor and do not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation. The machine translation is able to convey the meaning of the source text accurately and is easily understandable.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-German translation, I will first read and understand the source, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation to determine the quality of the machine translation.

Source: A tornado spawned 10 mi east of Yeehaw Junction downed trees along State Road 60.
Machine translation: Ein Tornado spawned 10 mi östlich von Yeehaw Junction stürzte Bäume entlang State Road 60.
Reference translation: Ein Tornado tauchte 10 Meilen östlich von Yeehaw-Junction auf und brachte Bäume entlang der State Road 60 zum Umstürzen.

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""spawned"" while the reference translation uses ""tauchte."" Both words mean ""appeared"" or ""formed"" in this context, so this difference does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.

2. The machine translation uses ""stürzte"" (fell) to describe the action of the trees, while the reference translation uses ""brachte...zum Umstürzen"" (brought...to fall). Both phrases convey the same meaning, but the reference translation is more specific and descriptive. This difference slightly favors the reference translation.

3. The machine translation uses ""entlang State Road 60"" (along State Road 60), while the reference translation uses ""entlang der State Road 60"" (along the State Road 60). Both phrases convey the same meaning, but the reference translation is more grammatically correct by including the definite article ""der."" This difference slightly favors the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation is very close to the reference translation in terms of meaning and grammar. However, the reference translation is slightly more specific, descriptive, and grammatically correct. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is high, but there is still room for improvement.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: His three brigades instead marched to the banks of Bull Run Creek, where Orlando Poe's brigade forded the creek.
Machine translation: Seine drei Brigaden marschierten stattdessen an die Ufer des Bull Run Creek, wo Orlando Poes Brigade den Bach verließ.
Reference translation: Seine drei Brigaden marschierten stattdessen zum Ufer des Bull Run Creek , wo Orlando Poes Brigade den Bach überquerte .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""an die Ufer"" (to the banks) is used, while the reference translation uses ""zum Ufer"" (to the shore/bank).
2. In the machine translation, ""den Bach verließ"" (left the creek) is used, while the reference translation uses ""den Bach überquerte"" (crossed the creek).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the first point is minor, as both ""an die Ufer"" and ""zum Ufer"" convey the same general meaning. However, ""zum Ufer"" is more accurate in this context, as it specifically refers to reaching the bank of a body of water.
2. The difference in the second point is more significant. The machine translation uses ""left the creek,"" which implies that the brigade moved away from the creek, while the reference translation uses ""crossed the creek,"" which implies that the brigade moved from one side of the creek to the other. This difference changes the meaning of the sentence and is not accurate.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of high quality, as it contains a significant inaccuracy in the second point. The translation of ""forded the creek"" as ""left the creek"" changes the meaning of the sentence and is not an accurate representation of the source text.

- ""ab"" in the reference translation (preposition, not present in the machine translation)

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The meaning of the sentence is preserved in the machine translation, but there are minor differences in word choice and structure.
- The use of ""stellt auf Sperre"" in the machine translation is a valid alternative to ""riegelt ab"" in the reference translation, so this difference does not significantly impact the quality.
- The absence of the preposition ""ab"" in the machine translation is a minor omission that does not significantly impact the overall meaning.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is good, with only minor differences in word choice and structure compared to the reference translation. The meaning of the sentence is preserved, and the translation is understandable.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Source: The stubborn Tropical Depression Tina dissipated on October 11, shortly after entering the central Pacific.

Reference translation: Die hartnäckige tropische Depression Tina löste sich am 11. Oktober , kurz nach dem Eintritt in den Zentralpazifik , auf .

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""Tropische Depression"" while the reference translation uses ""tropische Depression."" The capitalization of ""Tropische"" in the machine translation is incorrect. The reference translation is correct.

2. The machine translation uses ""verschwand"" (disappeared) while the reference translation uses ""löste sich auf"" (dissipated). Both words convey a similar meaning, but ""löste sich auf"" is more accurate in the context of a tropical depression dissipating. The reference translation is more accurate.

3. The machine translation and reference translation both correctly use ""am 11. Oktober"" (on October 11) and ""kurz nach dem Eintritt in den Zentralpazifik"" (shortly after entering the central Pacific).

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor errors in capitalization and word choice. The reference translation is more accurate and should be considered the better translation.

Machine translation: Die Illinois Central Railroad, ein großer Bondholder, reichte Klage am 10. Juni 1868 ein.
Reference translation: Die Illinois Central Railroad , ein großer Anleiheninhaber , reichte Klage am 10. Juni 1868 ein .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Bondholder"" while the reference translation uses ""Anleiheninhaber"".
2. The machine translation does not use a comma after ""Bondholder"" while the reference translation does.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The term ""Bondholder"" is not the most accurate translation for ""Anleiheninhaber"". ""Anleiheninhaber"" refers to someone who holds bonds or debt securities, while ""Bondholder"" is a more general term for someone who holds bonds. The reference translation is more accurate in this regard.
2. The use of a comma after ""Bondholder"" in the reference translation is more grammatically correct in German, as it separates the two clauses in the sentence. The machine translation omits this comma, which is a minor error but still affects the readability of the sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor inaccuracies and errors compared to the reference translation. The quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using a more accurate term for ""Anleiheninhaber"" and by including the comma for better readability.

Source: Once fermented, wine was transferred to wineskins or large amphorae for storage.
Machine translation: Nach der Gärung wurde der Wein zur Lagerung auf Weinschläuche oder große Amphoren übertragen.
Reference translation: Nach der Gärung wurde der Wein zur Lagerung in Weinschläuche oder große Amphoren umgefüllt.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""zur Lagerung auf"" while the reference translation uses ""zur Lagerung in"".
- The machine translation uses ""übertragen"" while the reference translation uses ""umgefüllt"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in prepositions ""auf"" vs. ""in"" changes the meaning slightly. ""Auf"" implies that the wine was transferred to the wineskins or amphorae as a destination, while ""in"" implies that the wine was transferred into the wineskins or amphorae, filling them up.
- The difference in verbs ""übertragen"" vs. ""umgefüllt"" also changes the meaning slightly. ""Übertragen"" implies that the wine was transferred or moved from one place to another, while ""umgefüllt"" implies that the wine was filled into the wineskins or amphorae.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it uses different prepositions and verbs that change the meaning slightly from the reference translation.

- In the machine translation, ""so dass"" is used instead of ""und lässt"" (and leaves).
- In the machine translation, ""im Palazzo"" is used instead of ""im Palazzo zurück"" (in the palazzo back).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of ""loops"" instead of ""entkommen ist"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""loops"" does not convey the same idea of escaping.
- The use of ""so dass"" instead of ""und lässt"" changes the structure of the sentence and the meaning, as ""so dass"" implies a result, while ""und lässt"" implies an action.
- The use of ""im Palazzo"" instead of ""im Palazzo zurück"" omits the idea of leaving the palazzo behind, which is an important part of the original meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of low quality because it changes the meaning of the source text and omits important information. The reference translation is more accurate and conveys the original meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the source text, the word ""Americans"" is used after each nationality, while in the machine translation, it is omitted. This is a minor difference, but it is important to note that the machine translation is missing a key part of the original text.

2. The reference translation uses the word ""Amerikaner"" (Americans) in the German translation, which is the correct translation for ""Americans"" in German. The machine translation uses ""Amerikaner"" (Americans) instead, which is a minor difference but still not entirely accurate.

3. The reference translation uses the word ""Diaspora"" in German, while the machine translation uses ""Diaspora"" as well, which is the correct translation.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences compared to the reference translation. The most significant difference is the omission of ""Americans"" after each nationality, which is an important part of the original text. The other differences are minor and do not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.

Reference translation: William Welsh , ein bekannter Kaufmann aus Philadelphia , bischöflicher Philanthrop und Ordensmann , stellte die Gemeinde vor eine Herausforderung .

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation has ""von Philadelphia"" (of Philadelphia) while the reference translation has ""aus Philadelphia"" (from Philadelphia). The difference in prepositions slightly changes the meaning, as ""von"" implies a connection to Philadelphia, while ""aus"" implies a location originating from Philadelphia.

2. The machine translation has ""bischöflicher Philanthrope"" (episcopal philanthropist) while the reference translation has ""bischöflicher Philanthrop"" (bishop philanthropist). The machine translation adds the adjective ""er"" (male) to the noun ""Philanthrop"" (philanthropist), making it more specific. However, the source text does not specify the gender, so this difference is not critical.

3. The machine translation has ""Ordensmann"" (vestryman) while the reference translation has the same word. This word is used to describe a member of the vestry, a group of laypeople responsible for the administration of an Episcopal church.

4. The machine translation has ""stellte die Gemeinde vor eine Herausforderung"" (issued a challenge to the congregation) while the reference translation has the same phrase. This phrase accurately conveys the idea that William Welsh presented a challenge or task to the congregation.

In conclusion, the machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text. However, there are some minor differences in the prepositions and the addition of the adjective ""er"" in the machine translation. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using the correct preposition ""aus"" instead of ""von"" and by removing the adjective ""er"" in ""bischöflicher Philanthrope.""

506	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the English-German translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: The aircraft mistook the British cruiser for their target and fired torpedoes.
Machine translation: Das Flugzeug vermistete den britischen Kreuzer für ihr Ziel und feuerte Torpedos.
Reference translation: Das Flugzeug hielt den britischen Kreuzer für das Ziel und feuerte Torpedos ab.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""vermistete"" (mistook) vs. ""hielt"" (held)
- Machine translation: ""euer"" (their) vs. ""das"" (the)
- Machine translation: ""feuerte Torpedos"" (fired torpedoes) vs. ""feuerte Torpedos ab"" (fired torpedoes off)

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- ""vermistete"" vs. ""hielt"": The machine translation uses ""vermistete"" (mistook), while the reference translation uses ""hielt"" (held). Both words convey the idea of mistaken identity, but ""hielt"" is more appropriate in this context, as it implies a more deliberate action. The machine translation is slightly less accurate in this regard.
- ""euer"" vs. ""das"": The machine translation uses ""euer"" (their), while the reference translation uses ""das"" (the). ""Euer"" is plural, while ""das"" is singular. In this context, ""das"" is the correct choice, as the sentence refers to a single British cruiser. The machine translation is less accurate in this regard.
- ""feuerte Torpedos"" vs. ""feuerte Torpedos ab"": The machine translation uses ""feuerte Torpedos"" (fired torpedoes), while the reference translation uses ""feuerte Torpedos ab"" (fired torpedoes off). The reference translation is more accurate, as it specifies that the torpedoes were fired ""off"" the aircraft, indicating that they were released into the water. The machine translation is less accurate in this regard.

Conclusion: The machine translation is less accurate than the reference translation in several aspects. It uses ""vermistete"" instead of ""hielt,"" ""euer"" instead of ""das,"" and ""feuerte Torpedos"" instead of ""feuerte Torpedos ab."" Overall, the quality of the machine translation is not very high.

Source: Early in spring, Alaric, probably desperate, invaded Italy, and he drove Honorius westward from Mediolanum, besieging him in Hasta Pompeia in Liguria.

Machine translation: Zu Beginn des Frühlings marschierte Alarik, wahrscheinlich verzweifelt, in Italien ein, und er trieb Honorius von Mediolanum nach Westen und belagerte ihn in Hasta Pompeia in Ligurien.

Reference translation: Zu Beginn des Frühlings marschierte Alarik , wahrscheinlich verzweifelt , in Italien ein , und er trieb Honorius von Mediolanum nach Westen und belagerte ihn in Hasta Pompeia in Ligurien .

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. Both translations convey the same meaning and are very similar in structure.
2. The only difference is the presence of a comma after ""Alarik"" in the reference translation, which is not present in the machine translation. This is a minor difference and does not significantly affect the overall meaning or quality of the translation.

Based on this analysis, I would say that the machine translation is of high quality, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is very similar to the reference translation. The minor difference in punctuation does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.

Differences:
1. In the machine translation, ""Dampfkessel"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""Kessel."" Both words mean ""boiler,"" but ""Kessel"" is more specific to the context of a steamboat.
2. In the machine translation, ""Dampfer"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""Dampfschiff."" Both words mean ""steamboat,"" but ""Dampfschiff"" is more specific to the context of a steamboat's boiler exploding.
3. The machine translation uses ""erlag seinen Wunden am 21. Juni"" (succumbed to his wounds on June 21), while the reference translation uses ""erlag am 21. Juni seinen Wunden"" (died of his wounds on June 21). The difference is in the word order, but both convey the same meaning.

Source: There, he saw his article for Tourist republished in The Gleaner.
Machine translation: Dort sah er seinen Artikel für Tourist in The Gleaner wiederveröffentlicht.
Reference translation: Dort sah er die Wiederveröffentlichung seines Artikels für Touristen im The Gleaner.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""für Tourist"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""für Touristen"" is used.
2. In the machine translation, ""wiederveröffentlicht"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""Wiederveröffentlichung"" is used.
3. In the machine translation, ""im The Gleaner"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""im The Gleaner"" is also used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference between ""für Tourist"" and ""für Touristen"" is minor. ""für Tourist"" can be understood as ""for Tourist"" or ""for Tourists,"" but it is less clear than ""für Touristen,"" which clearly means ""for Tourists."" This is a minor issue, but it slightly reduces the quality of the machine translation.
2. The difference between ""wiederveröffentlicht"" and ""Wiederveröffentlichung"" is more significant. ""wiederveröffentlicht"" means ""republished,"" while ""Wiederveröffentlichung"" means ""republication."" The reference translation is more specific and accurate, as it refers to the act of republishing rather than just the fact of being republished. This issue reduces the quality of the machine translation.
3. The use of ""im The Gleaner"" in both translations is correct and does not affect the quality of the machine translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor issues that reduce its quality compared to the reference translation. The main issue is the difference between ""wiederveröffentlicht"" and ""Wiederveröffentlichung."" Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement.

Reference translation: Als Richard sich weigert , geht Hurley heimlich zum Black Rock und entschärft das verbleibende Dynamit .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""das verbleibende Dynamit"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""das verbleibende Dynamit"" is used.
2. In the machine translation, ""den verbleibenden Dynamit"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""das verbleibende Dynamit"" is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""das verbleibende Dynamit"" in the reference translation is grammatically correct, as it agrees with the neuter noun ""Dynamit."" The machine translation incorrectly uses ""den verbleibenden Dynamit,"" which is grammatically incorrect because ""verbleibenden"" is an adjective and should agree with the neuter noun ""Dynamit.""
2. The use of ""Als Richard sich weigert"" in the machine translation is correct, as it accurately conveys the meaning of ""When Richard refuses.""
3. The use of ""heimlich zum Black Rock"" in the machine translation is correct, as it accurately conveys the meaning of ""secretly to the Black Rock.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it contains a grammatical error in the use of ""den verbleibenden Dynamit"" instead of ""das verbleibende Dynamit."" The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by correcting this grammatical error.

Reference translation: Zuletzt schlug er zwei Innings als Relief Pitcher am 23. September 2017 , bevor die Cardinals ihn für den Rest des Jahres 2017 aus dem Verkehr zogen .

Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""in Erleichterung"" (in relief) instead of ""als Relief Pitcher"" (as a relief pitcher) in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but the reference translation is more accurate in describing the player's role as a relief pitcher.

2. The machine translation uses ""stilllegten"" (shut down) instead of ""aus dem Verkehr zogen"" (withdrew from play) in the reference translation. Both phrases convey the same meaning, but ""aus dem Verkehr zogen"" is more idiomatic in German.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation.

3. In the machine translation, ""wie Schneckenkiller"" (like slug killer) is used, while the reference translation uses ""wie Schneckenkorn"" (like slug bait).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""machen"" (make) in the machine translation is less accurate than ""stellt her"" (produces) in the reference translation, as it does not convey the same meaning of manufacturing or producing pesticides.
2. The use of ""Gartenbau Pestizide"" (garden pesticides) in the machine translation is less accurate than ""gartenbauliche Pestizide"" (horticultural pesticides) in the reference translation, as the latter is more specific to the context of horticulture.
3. The use of ""wie Schneckenkiller"" (like slug killer) in the machine translation is less accurate than ""wie Schneckenkorn"" (like slug bait) in the reference translation, as the latter is more specific to the type of pesticide being produced.

Conclusion: The machine translation is less accurate than the reference translation due to the differences in verb choice, specificity of pesticide type, and the type of pesticide being used.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: The dependency on the snowshoe hare by the great horned owl extends into Alaska as well.
Machine translation: Die Abhängigkeit vom Schneeschuhhasen durch die große gehörnte Eule erstreckt sich auch nach Alaska.
Reference translation: Die Abhängigkeit des Virginia-Uhus von Schneeschuhhasen erstreckt sich auch nach Alaska.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""große gehörnte Eule"" (great horned owl) while the reference translation uses ""Virginia-Uhu"" (Virginia owl), which is a more specific term for the same species.
2. The machine translation uses ""vom Schneeschuhhasen"" (from the snowshoe hare) while the reference translation uses ""von Schneeschuhhasen"" (on the snowshoe hare), which changes the meaning slightly.

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The use of ""große gehörnte Eule"" instead of ""Virginia-Uhu"" is a minor issue, as both terms refer to the same species. However, the reference translation is more specific and accurate.
2. The use of ""vom Schneeschuhhasen"" instead of ""von Schneeschuhhasen"" changes the meaning slightly. The source states a dependency ""on"" the snowshoe hare, while the machine translation states a dependency ""from"" the snowshoe hare. This difference in preposition changes the meaning from a reliance on the snowshoe hare to a more general relationship.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but there are some minor issues that affect the accuracy and meaning of the translation. The reference translation is more accurate and specific in its wording, which makes it a better translation.

Reference translation: Lokale Waffenmeister nähen fest gerollte Papierbündel mit Koranversen in die Schichten aus Baumwolle und Kapok ein .

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""Rüstungen"" (armor) is used, while in the reference translation, ""Waffenmeister"" (weaponsmith) is used. The reference translation is more accurate in this context.
2. In the machine translation, ""fest gewalzte Papiere"" (tightly rolled papers) is used, while in the reference translation, ""fest gerollte Papierbündel"" (tightly rolled paper bundles) is used. The reference translation is more accurate as it specifies ""bundles"" of paper.
3. In the machine translation, ""die mit Quranischen Versen in die Baumwollschichten eingeschrieben sind"" (inscribed with Quranic verses in the cotton layers) is used, while in the reference translation, ""Papierbündel mit Koranversen"" (paper bundles with Koran verses) is used. The reference translation is more accurate as it specifies that the verses are in the paper bundles.
4. In the machine translation, ""und Kapok"" (and kapok) is used, while in the reference translation, ""und Kapok"" (and kapok) is used. Both translations are accurate in this regard.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text and is more precise in its wording. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation.

Source: He narrates the book until Chapter 4, when the main narrator, Nelly, picks up the tale.
Machine translation: Er erzählt das Buch bis Kapitel 4, als die Haupterzählerin Nelly die Geschichte aufgreift.
Reference translation: Er erzählt das Buch bis Kapitel 4 , als die Haupterzählerin Nelly die Geschichte aufgreift .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation has a comma after ""Kapitel 4"" and before ""als"" while the reference translation does not have a comma.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The absence of the comma in the reference translation could be considered a minor error, as it does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. However, it is important to note that the comma is used correctly in the machine translation, as it separates the two clauses and makes the sentence structure clearer.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is of high quality, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is grammatically correct. The only difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of the comma, which is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality and effectively conveys the meaning of the source text. The only difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of a comma, which is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.

Reference translation: Autoren und Gelehrte , die in Rom aufblühten , wie Longinus und Caecilius , betrachteten sein Oratorium als erhaben .

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""florierten"" (flourished) while the reference translation uses ""aufblühten"" (bloomed). Both words convey a similar meaning, but ""aufblühten"" might better capture the idea of growth and development in the context of authors and scholars.

2. The machine translation places ""wie Longinus und Caecilius"" (like Longinus and Caecilius) after ""Gelehrte"" (scholars), while the reference translation places it after ""in Rom"" (in Rome). The reference translation's placement might be more natural in German, as it provides a clearer connection between the scholars and their location.

3. The machine translation uses ""Oratorium"" (oratory) for ""oratory,"" which is accurate. However, the reference translation uses a comma after ""Oratorium"" to set off the parenthetical phrase ""wie Longinus und Caecilius"" (like Longinus and Caecilius). This punctuation choice might be more appropriate in German, as it helps to emphasize the parenthetical phrase.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate and captures the meaning of the source text. However, there are some minor differences in word choice and punctuation that could be improved to better match the reference translation.

Machine translation: Im November 1928 absorbierte Nu Beta die Theta Beta Rho Fraternität.
Reference translation: Im November 1928 übernahm Nu Beta die Bruderschaft Theta Beta Rho .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""absorbierte"" (absorbed), while the reference translation uses ""übernahm"" (took over/acquired).
- The machine translation uses ""die Theta Beta Rho Fraternität"" (the Theta Beta Rho Fraternity), while the reference translation uses ""die Bruderschaft Theta Beta Rho"" (the Theta Beta Rho brotherhood).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The verb ""absorbierte"" (absorbed) implies that Nu Beta incorporated Theta Beta Rho into itself, while ""übernahm"" (took over/acquired) implies that Nu Beta took control of or acquired Theta Beta Rho. The source and reference translation both use the verb ""absorbed,"" so the machine translation is not accurate in this regard.
- The phrase ""die Theta Beta Rho Fraternität"" (the Theta Beta Rho Fraternity) is more formal and academic than ""die Bruderschaft Theta Beta Rho"" (the Theta Beta Rho brotherhood). The reference translation uses the term ""bruderschaft"" (brotherhood), which is more informal and conveys a sense of camaraderie. The machine translation is less accurate in this regard as well.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it uses different verbs and a more formal term for Theta Beta Rho. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the informal tone and the nature of the relationship between Nu Beta and Theta Beta Rho. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation.

The machine translation is almost identical to the reference translation. The only difference is the use of a period at the end of the sentence in the reference translation, while the machine translation does not have a period. This is a minor difference, and the overall quality of the machine translation is very high. The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and uses appropriate German grammar and vocabulary.

542	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the English-German translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Second line immigrated to Norway in 1600s whit colonel Jørgen Otto Brockenhuus.
Machine translation: Zweite Linie emigrierte nach Norwegen in 1600er Jahren mit Oberst Jørgen Otto Brockenhuus.
Reference translation: Die zweite Linie wanderte im 17. Jahrhundert mit Oberst Jørgen Otto Brockenhuus nach Norwegen aus .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- ""Second line"" vs ""Die zweite Linie"": The machine translation uses ""Zweite Linie"" which is a more accurate translation of ""Second line"" in this context.
- ""immigrated"" vs ""wanderte"": Both ""immigrated"" and ""wanderte"" convey the idea of moving to a new country, but ""wanderte"" is more accurate in this context as it implies a migration rather than just settling in a new country.
- ""in 1600s"" vs ""in 1600er Jahren"": Both phrases refer to the same time period, but ""in 1600er Jahren"" is more accurate as it specifies that it was during the 1600s (17th century) that the migration took place.
- ""whit"" vs ""mit"": Both ""whit"" and ""mit"" are prepositions that can be used to indicate accompaniment, but ""mit"" is the more accurate translation in this context.
- ""colonel"" vs ""Oberst"": Both ""colonel"" and ""Oberst"" are military ranks, but ""Oberst"" is the correct translation for ""colonel"" in German.
- ""to Norway"" vs ""nach Norwegen"": Both phrases indicate the destination, but ""nach Norwegen"" is the correct preposition to use in German.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, with only a few minor differences from the reference translation. The differences are mainly in the choice of words and prepositions, which do not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation can be considered good.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: He also brought the Ancients and Moderns quarrel into English with his Reflections on Ancient and Modern Learning.
Machine translation: Mit seinen Reflections on Ancient and Modern Learning brachte er auch den Streit der Ältesten und Modernen ins Englische.
Reference translation: Er übertrug mit seinen Überlegungen zum antiken und modernen Lernen auch den Streit zwischen dem Alten und Modernen ins Englische.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Mit seinen Reflections on Ancient and Modern Learning"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""Er übertrug mit seinen Überlegungen zum antiken und modernen Lernen.""
2. In the machine translation, ""brachte er auch den Streit der Ältesten und Modernen ins Englische"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""übertrug auch den Streit zwischen dem Alten und Modernen ins Englische.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation correctly translates the main subject of the sentence, ""He also brought the Ancients and Moderns quarrel into English,"" as ""Mit seinen Reflections on Ancient and Modern Learning brachte er auch den Streit der Ältesten und Modernen ins Englische."" However, the reference translation uses a more accurate and natural phrasing, ""Er übertrug mit seinen Überlegungen zum antiken und modernen Lernen auch den Streit zwischen dem Alten und Modernen ins Englische.""
2. The machine translation correctly translates the verb ""brought"" as ""brachte"" and the preposition ""into"" as ""ins."" However, the reference translation uses a more accurate preposition, ""übertrug,"" which better conveys the meaning of ""brought"" in this context.
3. The machine translation correctly translates the noun ""quarrel"" as ""Streit"" and the adjectives ""Ancients"" and ""Moderns"" as ""Ältesten"" and ""Modernen."" However, the reference translation uses a more accurate translation for ""Ancients"" and ""Moderns"" as ""Alten"" and ""Modernen.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in phrasing and word choice that make the reference translation slightly better. The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, but the reference translation provides a more natural and accurate translation.

Source: ACTH induces the release of corticosteriods and aldosterone from the adrenal gland.
Machine translation: ACTH führt zur Freisetzung von Kortikosterioden und Aldosteron aus der Nebennieren-Drüse.
Reference translation: ACTH induziert die Freisetzung von Kortikosteroiden und Aldosteron aus der Nebenniere.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""Nebennieren-Drüse"" (adrenal gland) while the reference translation uses ""Nebenniere"" (adrenal gland).
- The machine translation uses ""führt zur Freisetzung"" (induces the release) while the reference translation uses ""induziert die Freisetzung"" (induces the release).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the term for ""adrenal gland"" is minor, as both ""Nebennieren-Drüse"" and ""Nebenniere"" refer to the same organ. The difference in the term is likely due to the use of the hyphen in the machine translation, which is not necessary in this context.
- The difference in the verb phrase is more significant. The machine translation uses ""führt zur Freisetzung"" (induces the release), which is a passive voice construction, while the reference translation uses ""induziert die Freisetzung"" (induces the release), which is an active voice construction. The passive voice construction in the machine translation is less clear and less natural in German.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in the choice of words and the verb phrase that make it less clear and less natural than the reference translation. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using the active voice construction and the correct term for ""adrenal gland"" without the hyphen.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

1. In the machine translation, ""und fügte hinzu"" (and added) is used, while the reference translation uses ""und trug zur"" (and contributed to).
2. In the machine translation, ""die lore"" (the lore) is used, while the reference translation uses ""zur Legende"" (to the legend).
3. In the machine translation, ""of the Curse of the Smiths at the Indy 500"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""des Fluchs der Smiths beim Indy 500"" (of the curse of the Smiths at the Indy 500).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""und fügte hinzu"" (and added) in the machine translation is not as accurate as ""und trug zur"" (and contributed to) in the reference translation. The reference translation better conveys the idea of adding to the legend.
2. The use of ""die lore"" (the lore) in the machine translation is not as accurate as ""zur Legende"" (to the legend) in the reference translation. The reference translation better conveys the idea of a story or legend.
3. The use of ""of the Curse of the Smiths at the Indy 500"" in the machine translation is not as accurate as ""des Fluchs der Smiths beim Indy 500"" (of the curse of the Smiths at the Indy 500) in the reference translation. The reference translation better conveys the idea of a specific curse associated with the Smiths at the Indy 500 event.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation better conveys the idea of adding to the legend, the story or legend itself, and the specific curse associated with the Smiths at the Indy 500 event.

Machine translation: Graf Ristori bezeugt Lucretia und Ranieri und wirft ihnen Mord an Beauville und Verrat vor.
Reference translation: Graf Ristori sagt gegen Lucretia und Ranieri aus und beschuldigt sie des Mordes an Beauville und des Verrats .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""bezeugt"" is used, while ""sagt aus"" is used in the reference translation. Both words mean ""testify"" or ""bear witness"" in English, but ""sagt aus"" is more idiomatic in this context.
2. In the machine translation, ""wirft ihnen"" is used, while ""beschuldigt sie"" is used in the reference translation. Both phrases mean ""accuses them"" in English, but ""beschuldigt sie"" is more idiomatic in this context.
3. In the machine translation, ""Mord an Beauville"" is used, while ""des Mordes an Beauville"" is used in the reference translation. Both phrases mean ""murder of Beauville"" in English, but ""des Mordes an Beauville"" is more idiomatic in this context.
4. In the machine translation, ""Verrat vor"" is used, while ""des Verrats"" is used in the reference translation. Both phrases mean ""treason"" in English, but ""des Verrats"" is more idiomatic in this context.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in word choice and phrasing that make the reference translation more idiomatic and natural-sounding in German.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: Das Mote trug noch die Würde des earldom.
- Reference translation: Der Moot Hill trug noch die Würde des Grafschaft .

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""Mote"" while the reference translation uses ""Moot Hill.""
2. The machine translation uses ""earldom"" while the reference translation uses ""Grafschaft,"" which is the German word for ""county"" or ""earldom.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The difference in the name ""Mote"" vs. ""Moot Hill"" is likely due to a misunderstanding of the source text by the machine translation algorithm. The source text likely refers to ""Moot Hill,"" which is a historical term for a small hill or mound associated with a legal or administrative function.
2. The difference in the term ""earldom"" vs. ""Grafschaft"" is a minor error, as both terms refer to a similar concept of a noble title or rank. However, ""Grafschaft"" is more accurate in this context.

Reference translation: Das Bataillon passierte dann Sanananda Point und östlich zum Giruwa River vor Einbruch der Dunkelheit.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, the verb ""löschte"" (cleared) is used, while the reference translation uses the verb ""passierte"" (passed).
2. The machine translation uses the word ""östlich"" (east) before ""zum Giruwa River"" (to the Giruwa River), while the reference translation uses the word ""östlich"" (east) before ""zum"" (to).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The verb ""löschte"" (cleared) in the machine translation implies that the battalion removed or eliminated something at Sanananda Point, while the verb ""passierte"" (passed) in the reference translation simply means that the battalion went through or past Sanananda Point. This difference changes the meaning of the sentence.
2. The placement of the word ""östlich"" (east) in the machine translation makes it unclear whether it is describing the direction to the Giruwa River or the location of the river itself. In the reference translation, the placement of ""östlich"" (east) before ""zum"" (to) makes it clear that it is describing the direction to the river.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Evelyn Barbirolli, 97, British oboist, wife of Sir John Barbirolli.
Machine translation: Evelyn Barbirolli, 97, britische Oboistin, Ehefrau von Sir John Barbirolli.
Reference translation: Evelyn Barbirolli , 97 , britische Oboistin , Ehefrau von Sir John Barbirolli .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The reference translation has a comma after ""Evelyn Barbirolli,"" ""97,"" and ""britische Oboistin."" The machine translation does not have these commas.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The commas in the reference translation are used to separate the different pieces of information about Evelyn Barbirolli (her name, age, and occupation). In the machine translation, this information is not separated as clearly, which may make the sentence slightly harder to understand.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the lack of commas makes it slightly less clear than the reference translation. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement in terms of clarity.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-German translation, I will first read and understand the source, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation to determine the quality of the machine translation.

Source: A poll of sportswriters elected the Commodores as best team in the south, awarding them the Champ Pickens Trophy.
Machine translation: Eine Umfrage von Sportlern wählte die Commodores zum besten Team im Süden und verlieh ihnen die Champ Pickens Trophy.
Reference translation: In einer Umfrage unter Sportjournalisten wurden die Commodores zum besten Team im Süden gewählt und man verlieh ihnen die Champ Pickens Trophy.

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""Sportlern"" (athletes) while the reference translation uses ""Sportjournalisten"" (sportswriters). This is a minor difference, but it is important to note that sportswriters are not the same as athletes.
2. The machine translation uses ""Eine Umfrage von Sportlern"" (A survey of athletes) while the reference translation uses ""In einer Umfrage unter Sportjournalisten"" (In a survey among sportswriters). This difference changes the context of the sentence, as the source specifically mentions sportswriters, not athletes.
3. The machine translation uses ""wählte"" (elected) and ""verlieh"" (awarding), while the reference translation uses ""wurden gewählt"" (were elected) and ""verlieh"" (awarding). These are minor differences in verb tense and form, but they do not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor differences from the reference translation. The main difference is the use of ""Sportlern"" instead of ""Sportjournalisten,"" which changes the context of the sentence. However, the overall meaning of the sentence is still understandable, and the machine translation is of good quality.

Reference translation: Der Karneval auf Antigua und Barbuda
Difference: The machine translation uses ""Die"" (feminine) while the reference translation uses ""Der"" (masculine) for the article. The correct article for ""Karneval"" is ""Der,"" as it is a masculine noun.

2. Machine translation: ersetzten 1957 das Weihnachtsfest der Alten Zeit
Reference translation: ersetzte 1957 das Weihnachtsfest der Alten Zeit
Difference: The machine translation uses ""ersetzten"" (plural form of ""replace"") while the reference translation uses ""ersetzte"" (singular form of ""replace""). The correct form should be ""ersetzte"" since the source mentions ""The Antiguan and Barbudan Carnivals"" (plural).

3. Machine translation: mit der Hoffnung, den Tourismus anzuregen.

Machine translation: Insgesamt wurden von Juli bis Oktober 1940 rund 9.180 Sorties von Bombern geflogen.
Reference translation: Insgesamt wurden von Juli bis Oktober 1940 rund 9.180 Bomber-Einsätze geflogen.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Sorties von Bombern"" (sorties by bombers), while the reference translation uses ""Bomber-Einsätze"" (bomber missions).
2. The machine translation uses ""rund"" (around), while the reference translation does not include this word.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""Sorties von Bombern"" in the machine translation is not incorrect, but it is less specific than ""Bomber-Einsätze"" in the reference translation. The reference translation better conveys the idea of missions specifically involving bombers.
2. The inclusion of ""rund"" in the machine translation is not a significant issue, as it does not change the meaning of the sentence. However, its absence in the reference translation does not make it incorrect.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it is slightly less specific than the reference translation in describing the type of flights (sorties) involved. The inclusion of ""rund"" in the machine translation does not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using the same level of specificity as the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Raub durch"" while the reference translation uses ""durch"".
2. The machine translation uses a comma after ""Hyänen"" while the reference translation does not.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The use of ""Raub durch"" in the machine translation is not incorrect, but it is less common than ""durch"" alone. ""Raub durch"" emphasizes the act of predation, while ""durch"" simply states the cause of death. The reference translation's choice of ""durch"" is more neutral and common in German.
2. The comma after ""Hyänen"" in the machine translation is unnecessary and disrupts the flow of the sentence. In the reference translation, the lack of a comma makes the sentence more concise and easier to read.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor differences from the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- ""Globe"" vs. ""Klumpen"": The source text refers to a ""glob,"" which is a round mass of molten metal. The reference translation correctly uses ""Klumpen"" (clump), which is a more accurate term for a mass of molten metal. The machine translation incorrectly uses ""Globe"" (globe), which is not the correct term in this context.
- ""würde"" vs. ""entfernte"": The machine translation uses ""würde"" (would), which is a modal verb indicating possibility or probability.

""Erbarmt sich vor ihm"" implies that Gilgamesh has pity for Humbaba, but it also implies that Gilgamesh is looking down on Humbaba, as if he is above him. ""Zeigt Erbarmen"" simply means that Gilgamesh shows pity without the implication of looking down on Humbaba.
- The difference in the spacing between the words can be a stylistic choice, but it does not change the meaning of the sentence.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the choice of verb phrase and the spacing between the words slightly change the meaning and style of the original text.
- The reference translation is more faithful to the original source, as it maintains the meaning and style more accurately.

Machine translation: Die Times kommentierte, dass Wodehouse Ehre signalisierte ""offizielle Vergebung für seine Kriegsundiskretion....
Reference translation: Die Times kommentierte , dass Wodehouse ' Ehre "" offizielle Vergebung für seine Indiskretion während des Krieges ... "" signalisierte .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Kriegsundiskretion"" is used, which combines ""Krieg"" (war) and ""Undiskretion"" (indiscretion). In the reference translation, ""Indiskretion während des Krieges"" is used, which separates ""Indiskretion"" (indiscretion) and ""während des Krieges"" (during the war).
2. The machine translation uses a comma before ""offizielle Vergebung"" (official forgiveness), while the reference translation does not.
3. The machine translation uses a period after ""offizielle Vergebung"" and before ""für seine Kriegsundiskretion,"" while the reference translation does not.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The combination of ""Krieg"" and ""Undiskretion"" in the machine translation is not accurate, as it does not clearly convey the meaning of ""wartime indiscretion."" The reference translation separates the words, making the meaning clearer.

Machine translation: Neun von Reeds zehn Ochsen brachen frei, durstig und verschlossen sich in die Wüste.
Reference translation: Neun von Reeds zehn Ochsen brachen verrückt vor Durst aus und sausten in die Wüste.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""durstig"" (thirsty) while the reference translation uses ""verrückt vor Durst"" (crazed with thirst).
- The machine translation uses ""verschlossen sich in die Wüste"" (locked themselves into the desert) while the reference translation uses ""sausten in die Wüste"" (bolted into the desert).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The use of ""durstig"" in the machine translation is a more literal translation of ""thirsty"" and does not capture the same level of intensity as ""verrückt vor Durst"" in the reference translation. This makes the machine translation less vivid and engaging.
- The use of ""verschlossen sich in die Wüste"" in the machine translation implies that the oxen locked themselves into the desert, which is not the same as the reference translation's ""sausten in die Wüste,"" which implies that the oxen bolted into the desert. This difference in verb choice changes the imagery and the sense of urgency in the translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It lacks the intensity and vividness of the original text due to the choice of words and phrasing.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""Dochte"" vs. Reference translation: ""Pforten""
- Machine translation: ""nehmen drei pro Stück"" vs. Reference translation: ""nahmen drei pro Stück""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- ""Dochte"" vs. ""Pforten"": The machine translation uses the incorrect word ""Dochte"" instead of the correct word ""Pforten"". ""Dochte"" is not a common term in German and does not make sense in this context. ""Pforten"" refers to wickets in the context of cricket.

654	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the English-German translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: The Israelis responded by rapidly devising new tactics to thwart Egyptian air defenses.
Machine translation: Die Israelis reagierten, indem sie schnell neue Taktiken erarbeiteten, um ägyptische Luftverteidigungen zu verhindern.
Reference translation: Die Israelis reagierten , indem sie schnell neue Taktiken entwickelten , um die ägyptische Luftverteidigung zu vereiteln .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, the word ""ägyptische"" (Egyptian) is used, while in the reference translation, the word ""ägyptische"" is used with an accent (ägyptische).
2. In the machine translation, the word ""verhindern"" (to prevent) is used, while in the reference translation, the word ""vereiteln"" (to thwart) is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""ägyptische"" with an accent in the reference translation is likely a typo, as the meaning remains the same. The machine translation correctly uses the word ""ägyptische"" without an accent.
2. The use of ""verhindern"" in the machine translation and ""vereiteln"" in the reference translation results in a slight difference in meaning. ""Verhindern"" means to prevent, while ""vereiteln"" means to thwart or foil. The reference translation's choice of ""vereiteln"" better captures the intent of the source text, as it implies a more active and successful effort to overcome the Egyptian air defenses.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is mostly accurate, with only a slight difference in meaning due to the choice of verb. However, the overall quality of the machine translation is good, as it effectively conveys the meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Source: It toured Great Britain, appearing at twenty theatres between April and August 1989.
Machine translation: Zwischen April und August 1989 tourte sie durch Großbritannien, wo sie in zwanzig Theatern auftrat.
Reference translation: Zwischen April und August1989 tourte sie durch Großbritannien , wo sie in zwanzig Theatern auftrat .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation has a comma after ""Großbritannien"" while the reference translation does not.
2. The machine translation has ""sie"" (she) while the reference translation has a space before and after the period.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The comma after ""Großbritannien"" in the machine translation is not necessary and does not affect the meaning of the sentence. It is a minor difference and does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.
2. The ""sie"" in the machine translation is a pronoun referring to a subject, which is not present in the source text. However, the context suggests that the subject is likely a person or group of people (e.g., a performer or a group of performers). The reference translation does not include the pronoun, but the meaning is still clear. This difference does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Overall, the machine translation is of high quality. It accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is very close to the reference translation. The minor differences mentioned above do not significantly impact the quality of the translation.

1. In the machine translation, the word ""ausgelöscht"" (erased) is used, while the reference translation uses ""kraftlos"" (powerless).
2. In the machine translation, the verb ""präsentierte"" (presented) is used, while the reference translation uses ""präsentierten"" (presented, in plural form to match the subject ""Whigs"").

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""ausgelöscht"" instead of ""kraftlos"" changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Ausgelöscht"" implies that the president has been erased or removed, while ""kraftlos"" means powerless or weak. This is a significant difference in meaning.
2. The use of ""präsentierte"" instead of ""präsentierten"" is a grammatical error, as it does not match the plural subject ""Whigs."" This is a minor error, but it affects the grammatical correctness of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some significant differences from the reference translation, including a change in meaning and a grammatical error. The overall quality of the machine translation is not high, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and contains errors in grammar.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Viral pneumonia presents more commonly with wheezing than bacterial pneumonia.
Machine translation: Virale Lungenentzündung präsentiert sich häufiger mit Keuchen als bakterielle Lungenentzündung.
Reference translation: Virale Lungenentzündung tritt häufiger mit Keuchen auf als eine bakterielle Lungenentzündung.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""präsentiert sich"" (presents itself) while the reference translation uses ""tritt auf"" (occurs).
- The machine translation uses ""als bakterielle Lungenentzündung"" (as bacterial pneumonia) while the reference translation uses ""eine bakterielle Lungenentzündung"" (a bacterial pneumonia).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The use of ""präsentiert sich"" in the machine translation is not incorrect, but it is less concise than ""tritt auf"" in the reference translation. ""Tritt auf"" (occurs) better conveys the idea that the viral pneumonia often comes with wheezing.
- The use of ""als bakterielle Lungenentzündung"" (as bacterial pneumonia) in the machine translation is not incorrect, but it is less specific than ""eine bakterielle Lungenentzündung"" (a bacterial pneumonia) in the reference translation. ""Eine bakterielle Lungenentzündung"" (a bacterial pneumonia) is a more precise term and better conveys the idea that the comparison is being made to a specific type of pneumonia.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it is less concise and less specific than the reference translation. The differences in word choice and phrasing slightly affect the clarity of the translation. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using more concise and specific language.

3. Reference translation: Briarcliff Manor lässt sich von "" Brier Cliff "" ableiten , einer Verbindung der englischen Wörter "" brier "" und "" cliff "" .

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

- The machine translation uses ""stammt aus"" (comes from), while the reference translation uses ""lässt sich von ableiten"" (can be derived from). Both phrases convey the idea that Briarcliff Manor is derived from ""Brier Cliff"", but the reference translation is more accurate in expressing the idea of derivation.
- The machine translation uses ""einer Verbindung"" (a connection), while the reference translation uses ""einer Verbindung"" (a compound). Both phrases convey the idea that ""Brier Cliff"" is a combination of the English words ""brier"" and ""cliff"". However, the reference translation is more accurate in using the term ""compound"" to describe this combination.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: She suffered from shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, distress, necrophobia and insomnia.
Machine translation: Sie litt an Atemnot, Müdigkeit, Husten, Nekrophobie und Schlaflosigkeit.
Reference translation: Sie litt an Atemnot , Müdigkeit , Husten , Nekrophobie und Schlaflosigkeit .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The reference translation has a space before and after each comma, while the machine translation does not have spaces before the commas.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The lack of spaces before the commas in the machine translation makes it slightly less readable than the reference translation. However, the meaning of the sentence is still clear.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. The only difference is the formatting of the commas, which does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The quality of the English-German machine translation is good, with only a minor formatting issue. The translation is mostly accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: This became a symbol of Stevenson's frugality and earthiness.
Machine translation: Dies wurde ein Symbol für Stevensons Sparsamkeit und Erdenheit.
Reference translation: Dies wurde ein Symbol für Stevensons Genügsamkeit und Erdigkeit.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""Sparsamkeit"" (frugality) while the reference translation uses ""Genügsamkeit"" (contentment).
- The machine translation uses ""Erdenheit"" (earthiness) while the reference translation uses ""Erdigkeit"" (earthy nature).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the first word (""Sparsamkeit"" vs. ""Genügsamkeit"") changes the meaning slightly. Frugality refers to being careful with money and resources, while contentment refers to being satisfied with what one has. This difference could change the overall interpretation of the sentence.
- The difference in the second word (""Erdenheit"" vs. ""Erdigkeit"") also changes the meaning slightly. Earthiness refers to a connection with the earth and nature, while earthy nature refers to a specific quality of being down-to-earth and unpretentious. This difference could also change the overall interpretation of the sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of high quality because it uses different words that change the meaning of the source text. The reference translation more accurately captures the original meaning of the source text.

Reference translation: Das Geschwader formierte sich am 3. April in Guadaloupe neu und segelte dann nach Martinique , wo es am 5. April in Saint Pierre ankam .

Differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""Die Staffel"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""Das Geschwader"" is used. Both terms can refer to a squadron, but ""Geschwader"" is more specific to military aviation, while ""Staffel"" can refer to a squadron in general.
2. In the machine translation, ""gruppierte sich"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""formierte sich"" is used. Both verbs mean ""regrouped"" or ""grouped,"" but ""formierte sich"" is more specific to reorganizing or forming anew.
3. In the machine translation, ""segelte dann nach Martinique"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""segelte dann nach Martinique,"" is used. Both phrases mean ""sailed then to Martinique,"" but the reference translation includes a comma, which makes it clearer that the action of sailing is continuous.
4. In the machine translation, ""wo sie am 5. April in Saint Pierre ankam"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""wo es am 5. April in Saint Pierre ankam"" is used. Both phrases mean ""where it arrived in Saint Pierre on 5 April,"" but the reference translation uses ""es"" (it) instead of ""sie"" (she), which is more appropriate for referring to a squadron.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in word choice and grammar that make the reference translation slightly better.

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""die collier"" while the reference translation uses ""den Bergarbeiter"" to refer to the collier. The correct translation should be ""den Bergarbeiter"" as it is a masculine noun in the dative case.

2. The machine translation uses ""zurück"" to describe the wreck, while the reference translation uses ""auflief"" to describe the same event. The correct translation should be ""auflief"" as it accurately describes the event of the ship running aground.

3. The machine translation places the word ""ein wenig"" before ""spät"" and ""zu spät"" in the reference translation. The correct translation should be ""ein wenig spät"" as it is more natural in German.

4. The machine translation uses ""südlich der Insel"" while the reference translation uses ""südlich der Insel"" to describe the location of the reef. Both translations are correct.

Reference translation: Die einheimische Bevölkerung litt auch an tropischen Geschwüren , Frambösie und Vitaminmangel , vor allem Beri Beri .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Gelben"" for ""yaws"" while the reference translation uses ""Frambösie"" (French word for yaws).
2. The machine translation does not include the word ""vitamin deficiencies"" while the reference translation does.

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""Gelben"" instead of ""Frambösie"" for ""yaws"" is a minor error, as ""Gelben"" is a disease in German, but it is not the correct term for ""yaws."" The reference translation uses the French term ""Frambösie,"" which is also a common term for ""yaws"" in German.
2. The omission of ""vitamin deficiencies"" in the machine translation is a more significant error. The source text specifically mentions ""vitamin deficiencies"" as one of the issues suffered by the native population. The reference translation correctly includes this term.

Source: He mocks the assassin's new 'Bullseye' tattoo and carves a new one over it with a rock.
Machine translation: Er verspottet das neue Tattoo des Attentäters ""Bullseye"" und schnitzt ein neues mit einem Rock darüber.
Reference translation: Er verspottet das neue „ Bullseye “ -Tattoo des Attentäters und ritzt mit einem Stein ein neues darüber .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. Machine translation uses ""Rock"" (German for ""stone"") while the reference translation uses ""Stein"" (also German for ""stone"").
2. Machine translation uses ""schnitzt"" (carves) while the reference translation uses ""ritzt"" (also means to carve in German).
3. Machine translation uses ""darüber"" (over it) while the reference translation uses ""darüber"" (also means over it in German).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The difference in the word for ""stone"" does not significantly impact the meaning or quality of the translation. Both words are synonyms and convey the same idea.
2. The difference in the verb ""schnitzt"" vs. ""ritzt"" also does not significantly impact the meaning or quality of the translation. Both verbs are used to describe the action of carving, and the difference is minimal.

Reference translation: Gelatineartige Würmer winden sich von Schicht zu Schicht und wandern durch die mit Orangenmoos verkrustete Tentakelvegetation , die alle über einem Amöbenmeer schweben .

Differences:

1. ""Gelatinous"" vs ""Gelatinöse"": The machine translation uses ""Gelatinöse"" while the reference translation uses ""Gelatineartige"". Both words mean ""gelatinous"" in English, but ""Gelatineartige"" is more accurate in this context as it is an adjective derived from ""Gelatine"" (gelatin), which is more specific than ""Gelatinöse"" (gelatinous).

2. ""Würmer schlängeln sich"" vs ""Würmer winden sich"": The machine translation uses ""schlängeln sich"" (to slither) while the reference translation uses ""winden sich"" (to wind). The verb ""winden sich"" is more appropriate in this context as it conveys the idea of the worms moving through layers more accurately.

3. ""ententakelte Vegetation"" vs ""mit Orangenmoos verkrustete Tentakelvegetation"": The machine translation uses ""ententakelte Vegetation"" (de-tentacled vegetation) while the reference translation uses ""mit Orangenmoos verkrustete Tentakelvegetation"" (tentacled vegetation encrusted with orange moss). The reference translation is more accurate as it maintains the original meaning of the source text, which is that the vegetation is both tentacled and encrusted with orange moss.

Machine translation: Ihr wurzelt für sie und sympathisiert mit ihrer Not "".
Reference translation: Ihr ermutigt sie und sympathisiert mit ihrer Not . ""

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""wurzelt"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""ermutigt"" is used.
2. In the machine translation, ""und"" is used to connect the two actions, while in the reference translation, a comma is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The verb ""wurzelt"" means ""to root for"" in English, while ""ermutigt"" means ""to encourage"" or ""to cheer on."" The difference in meaning changes the overall meaning of the sentence. In the reference translation, the speaker is encouraging the others and sympathizing with their situation, while in the machine translation, the speaker is rooting for them and sympathizing with their situation.
2. The use of ""und"" in the machine translation is grammatically correct, but the use of a comma in the reference translation is more natural in English.

Step 4: Determine the quality of the machine translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Nijinska had admirably seized the spirit of mountebank buffoonery.
Machine translation: Nijinska hatte bewundernswert den Geist der Gebirgsbüffelei ergriffen.
Reference translation: Nijinska had admirably seized the spirit of mountebank buffoonery.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: Nijinska hatte bewundernswert den Geist der Gebirgsbüffelei ergriffen.
- Reference translation: Nijinska had admirably seized the spirit of mountebank buffoonery.

Differences:
1. ""bewundernswert"" (wonderful) is used instead of ""admirably"" in the reference translation.
2. ""Gebirgsbüffelei"" (mountain buffoonery) is used instead of ""mountebank buffoonery"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. ""bewundernswert"" is a close synonym to ""admirably,"" so this difference does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.
2. ""Gebirgsbüffelei"" is a more literal translation of ""buffoonery,"" but it does not capture the specific meaning of ""mountebank buffoonery"" (a type of street performance or showmanship). This difference does impact the quality of the translation, as it loses some of the original meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it loses some of the original meaning due to the choice of the word ""Gebirgsbüffelei"" instead of ""mountebank buffoonery."" The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using a more accurate translation for ""mountebank buffoonery.""

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: For fear of the Bolsheviks’ Asiatic will to annihilate, Hitler himself committed an “Asiatic deed”.
Machine translation: Aus Angst vor den Bolschewiki war der asiatische Wille zur Vernichtung Hitlers selbst eine fromatische Tat.
Reference translation: Aus Angst der Bolschewiki vor dem asiatischen Willen zur Vernichtung war Hitler selbst gewillt eine asiatische Tat zu vollbringen.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation has ""Aus Angst vor den Bolschewiki"" while the reference translation has ""Aus Angst der Bolschewiki"".
2. The machine translation has ""der asiatische Wille zur Vernichtung Hitlers selbst"" while the reference translation has ""vor dem asiatischen Willen zur Vernichtung"".
3. The machine translation has ""eine fromatische Tat"" while the reference translation has ""eine asiatische Tat zu vollbringen"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation incorrectly places the fear before the Bolsheviks, while the reference translation correctly places the fear after the Bolsheviks. This changes the meaning of the sentence.
2. The machine translation incorrectly places the ""Asiatic will to annihilate"" before Hitler, while the reference translation correctly places it after Hitler. This changes the meaning of the sentence.
3. The machine translation uses the incorrect word ""fromatische"" instead of ""asiatische"" in the last part of the sentence. This changes the meaning of the sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of low quality because it significantly deviates from the reference translation in meaning and structure. The errors in the machine translation change the meaning of the original source, making it an inaccurate representation of the source text.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: It is saturated with materialism, sensualism and … commercialism’.
Machine translation: Es ist gesättigt mit Materialismus, Sinnlichkeit und Virtualität.
Reference translation: Es ist reich an Materialismus , Sinnlichkeit und Virtualität .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""gesättigt"" (saturated), while the reference translation uses ""reich an"" (rich in).
- The machine translation uses ""Virtualität"" (virtuality), while the reference translation uses the same word.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the first point is minor, as both ""gesättigt"" and ""reich an"" can convey the idea of being abundant or full of something. However, ""gesättigt"" implies a more negative connotation, as it suggests that something has reached its limit and cannot take in any more. ""Reich an"" has a more neutral connotation, simply stating that something is rich in a particular quality.
- The difference in the second point is not significant, as both translations use the same word for ""virtuality.""

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but there are some minor differences in the choice of words that could affect the meaning slightly. The machine translation captures the general idea of the source text, but the choice of ""gesättigt"" instead of ""reich an"" may give a slightly different impression of the subject being translated.

Source: Dorothy, however, tricks the two Nomes into revealing the Prince of Ev and restores her friends.
Machine translation: Dorothy jedoch bringt die beiden Nomaden dazu, den Prinzen von Ev zu enthüllen und ihre Freunde wiederherzustellen.
Reference translation: Dorothy bringt die beiden Nomes jedoch dazu , den Prinzen von Ev zu enthüllen , und stellt ihre Freunde wieder her .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. In the machine translation, ""Nomaden"" is used instead of ""Nomes"" in the reference translation.
2. In the machine translation, ""ihre Freunde wiederherzustellen"" is used instead of ""stellt ihre Freunde wieder her"" in the reference translation.
3. In the machine translation, ""und"" is used before ""ihre Freunde wiederherzustellen"" while in the reference translation, ""und"" is used before ""stellt ihre Freunde wieder her"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The difference in the translation of ""Nomades"" and ""Nomes"" is due to the incorrect translation of the word ""Nomes"" in the source text. The machine translation correctly translates the word as ""Nomades,"" which is the correct German term for ""nomads.""
2. The difference in the translation of ""wiederherzustellen"" and ""wieder her"" is due to the incorrect translation of the word ""restores"" in the source text. The machine translation correctly translates ""restores"" as ""wiederherzustellen,"" which means ""to restore."" The reference translation incorrectly translates ""restores"" as ""stellt wieder her,"" which means ""puts back together again.""
3. The difference in the use of ""und"" before ""ihre Freunde wiederherzustellen"" and ""stellt ihre Freunde wieder her"" is due to the incorrect translation of the word ""and"" in the source text. The machine translation correctly translates ""and"" as ""und,"" which is the correct German conjunction for ""and."" The reference translation incorrectly translates ""and"" as ""und,"" which is not the correct conjunction for ""and"" in this context.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality, as it correctly translates the source text into German. The reference translation contains errors in the translation of the source text, which results in a lower quality translation.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""bootlegged wurde"" (was bootlegged) while the reference translation uses ""gefälscht wurde"" (was faked). The difference here is the use of ""bootlegged"" versus ""faked"". Bootlegging refers to the illegal copying and distribution of copyrighted material, while faking refers to the creation of a counterfeit or imitation.

2. The machine translation uses ""haben Lennon und McCartney nie wieder zusammen aufgenommen"" (Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again) while the reference translation uses ""nahmen Lennon und McCartney nie wieder etwas zusammen auf"" (Lennon and McCartney never took something together again). The difference here is the use of ""aufgenommen"" (recorded) versus ""etwas zusammen auf"" (something together). The reference translation is more general, implying that Lennon and McCartney never collaborated on anything again, while the machine translation specifically refers to recording.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in the choice of words that make it slightly less precise than the reference translation.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""Feldpackung"" vs. ""Feldausrüstung"": The machine translation uses ""Feldpackung"" (field pack), while the reference translation uses ""Feldausrüstung"" (field equipment). The difference is subtle, but ""Feldausrüstung"" is a more specific term for the equipment used in the field, while ""Feldpackung"" could be interpreted as a general backpack or bag.

2. ""Schmutz"" vs. ""Dreck"": The machine translation uses ""Schmutz"" (dirt, grime), while the reference translation uses ""Dreck"" (dirt, filth). Both words have a similar meaning, but ""Dreck"" has a slightly stronger connotation of filth or dirtiness.

3. ""Schleppen"" vs. ""Schleppen von Dreck"": The machine translation uses ""Schleppen"" (dragging, pulling) alone, while the reference translation uses ""Schleppen von Dreck"" (dragging dirt). The reference translation is more specific about what is being dragged, which is important for the context of the sentence.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor differences compared to the reference translation. The use of ""Feldpackung"" instead of ""Feldausrüstung"" makes the translation slightly less specific, and the omission of ""von Dreck"" makes the translation less clear about what is being dragged.

Machine translation: Insektenlarven nutzen Wasser für die Zucht und ernähren sich von kleineren Kopepoden und Amphipoden, die in mikroskopischen Algen und peripheren Formationen leben.

Reference translation: Insektenlarven nutzen Wasser für die Brut und ernähren sich von kleineren Kopepoden und Amphipoden , die in mikroskopischen Algen und peripheren Formationen leben .

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""Zucht"" (breeding) while the reference translation uses ""Brut"" (offspring). Although these words are similar in meaning, ""Brut"" is more specific to the context of insect larvae reproduction.

2. The machine translation uses ""ernähren sich"" (feed upon) while the reference translation uses the same phrase. This is an accurate translation and conveys the correct meaning.

3. The machine translation uses ""peripheren Formationen"" (peripheral formations) while the reference translation uses ""periphyton formations."" Although ""peripheral formations"" is not incorrect, ""periphyton formations"" is more specific to the context of the source text.

Based on this analysis, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has some minor differences in word choice that could affect the overall quality of the translation. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the specific context of the source text. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is good but not perfect.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: The shooters fired from the brink of the smaller pits.
Machine translation: Die Schützen feuerten am Rande der kleineren Gruben.
Reference translation: Die Schützen feuerten vom Rand der kleineren Gruben.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
In this case, the difference is the preposition used: ""am Rande"" (at the edge) in the machine translation vs. ""vom Rand"" (from the edge) in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the meaning of the different prepositions.
""am Rande"" implies that the shooters were firing at the edge of the smaller pits, while ""vom Rand"" implies that they were firing from the edge of the smaller pits.

Step 4: Determine the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.
In this case, the machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it changes the meaning of the original sentence by using a different preposition. The reference translation is more accurate, as it maintains the original meaning of the source.

Conclusion: The quality of the English-German machine translation is not very good in this case, as it changes the meaning of the original sentence. The reference translation is more accurate and should be used instead.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: Simon then dissipated as a tropical cyclone early on October 15 across the open waters of the northeast Pacific.
Machine translation: Simon zerstreute dann als tropischer Wirbelsturm früh am 15. Oktober über das offene Wasser des Nordostpazifik.
Reference translation: Simon löste sich dann als tropischer Wirbelsturm früh am 15. Oktober über dem offenen Wasser des Nordostpazifiks auf .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""zerstreute"" is used, while ""löste sich auf"" is used in the reference translation.
2. In the machine translation, ""über das offene Wasser"" is used, while ""über dem offenen Wasser"" is used in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The verb ""zerstreute"" (scattered) in the machine translation is not an accurate translation of ""dissipated"" in the source text. The verb ""löste sich auf"" (dissolved/dispersed) in the reference translation is a more accurate translation.
2. The prepositional phrase ""über das offene Wasser"" (over the open water) in the machine translation is not as accurate as ""über dem offenen Wasser"" (over the open water) in the reference translation. The use of ""dem"" in the reference translation correctly indicates the dative case, while ""das"" in the machine translation does not.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The differences in verb choice and prepositional phrase structure result in a less precise translation. The quality of the machine translation is therefore lower than that of the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: Hearings Before the Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations on H.R.
Machine translation: Anhörung vor dem Unterausschuss des Ausschusses für Aneignungen zu H.R.
Reference translation: Anhörung vor dem Unterausschuss des Ausschusses für H.R.-Mittelzuweisungen

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

Difference 1: The machine translation uses ""Aneignungen"" (appropriations), while the reference translation uses ""Mittelzuweisungen"" (allocations).
Difference 2: The machine translation does not include the word ""Mittelzuweisungen"" (allocations) in the translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate in this case. The word ""Aneignungen"" (appropriations) is not the correct translation for ""H.R.-Mittelzuweisungen"" (allocations). The reference translation is more accurate, as it correctly translates ""H.R.-Mittelzuweisungen"" as ""Mittelzuweisungen"" (allocations).

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is poor. It does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text, and it omits important information present in the reference translation. The machine translation is not a reliable translation of the source text.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: The depression soon intensified into Tropical Storm Paine around 1800 UTC on the September 11.
Machine translation: Die Depression intensivierte sich bald in Tropical Storm Paine um 1800 UTC am 11. September.
Reference translation: Die Depression baute sich am 11. September um 1800 UTC langsam zum Tropensturm Paine auf .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""intensivierte sich"" (intensified) while the reference translation uses ""baute sich auf"" (built up).
2. The machine translation uses ""in Tropical Storm Paine"" while the reference translation uses ""zum Tropensturm Paine"".
3. The machine translation uses ""am 11. September"" while the reference translation uses ""am 11. September"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""intensivierte sich"" in the machine translation is a more direct translation of ""intensified"" from the source, while ""baute sich auf"" in the reference translation is a more idiomatic way to express the same idea in German. This difference does not significantly impact the quality of the machine translation.
2. The use of ""in Tropical Storm Paine"" in the machine translation is a minor error, as the correct preposition in this context should be ""zum"" (to) in German. This error slightly reduces the quality of the machine translation.
3. The use of ""am 11. September"" in both translations is correct, so this part of the translation is of high quality.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor errors that affect the overall quality. The translation could be improved by using the more idiomatic expression ""baute sich auf"" and the correct preposition ""zum"" in the context of ""Tropical Storm Paine"".

Machine translation: Seit 1945 zählt Brunei Menschen nach Ethnizität in allen Volkszählungen seit 1947 auf.
Reference translation: Seit 1945 zählte Brunei Menschen in allen Volkszählungen nach ethnischer Zugehörigkeit auf .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""zählt"" (counts) while the reference translation uses ""zählte"" (counted).
2. The machine translation uses ""nach Ethnizität"" (by ethnicity) while the reference translation uses ""nach ethnischer Zugehörigkeit"" (by ethnic affiliation).
3. The machine translation uses ""auf"" (up) while the reference translation does not include this word.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""zählt"" instead of ""zählte"" does not significantly impact the meaning, as both indicate that Brunei has been counting people by ethnicity since 1945. However, the reference translation is more accurate, as it specifies that the counting occurred in all censuses since 1947.
2. The use of ""nach Ethnizität"" instead of ""nach ethnischer Zugehörigkeit"" is a minor difference, as both phrases convey the same general meaning. However, ""ethnischer Zugehörigkeit"" is more specific and accurate, as it refers to the ethnic affiliation of the people being counted.
3. The use of ""auf"" in the machine translation is unnecessary and does not add any meaningful information to the sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by using the more specific and accurate phrases found in the reference translation. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement.

Source: In the late 1860s, the crinolines disappeared and the bustles came into fashion in the 1870s.
Machine translation: In den späten 1860er Jahren verschwanden die Krinolinen und die Büste kamen in den 1870er Jahren in Mode.
Reference translation: In den späten 1860er Jahren verschwanden die Krinolinen und der Trubel kam in den 1870er Jahren in Mode.

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""die Büste"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""der Trubel"" is used. ""Die Büste"" refers to a bust or chest, while ""der Trubel"" refers to a commotion or disturbance. In the context of the source, ""der Trubel"" (commotion or disturbance) is more appropriate, as it refers to the change in fashion trends.

2. The machine translation correctly translates the time periods (late 1860s and 1870s) and the disappearance of crinolines. However, it does not accurately convey the meaning of ""the bustles came into fashion"" by using ""die Büste kamen in den 1870er Jahren in Mode."" The reference translation correctly uses ""der Trubel kam in den 1870er Jahren in Mode"" to convey the idea of the bustles becoming popular in the 1870s.

Based on the analysis, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation.

Machine translation: Schottland ging es schlecht, als sie wieder Schlagzeug und waren 45 / 3.
Reference translation: Schottland ging es schlecht , als sie wieder geschlagen wurden und es 45 / 3 stand .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- ""Schlagzeug"" (drums) in the machine translation vs. ""geschlagen wurden"" (were hit) in the reference translation.
- ""waren 45 / 3"" in the machine translation vs. ""es 45 / 3 stand"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""batted"" as ""Schlagzeug"" (drums), which is not related to the context of the sentence. The reference translation correctly translates ""batted"" as ""geschlagen wurden"" (were hit).
- The machine translation correctly translates ""45/3"" as ""45 / 3"", but the reference translation uses a different structure, ""es 45 / 3 stand"", which is also correct.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has one major error in translating ""batted"" as ""Schlagzeug"" (drums), which significantly affects the meaning of the sentence. The other differences are minor and do not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation. Therefore, the overall quality of the machine translation is poor.

Source: Schwarzenegger won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.
Machine translation: Schwarzenegger gewann 1964 und 1965 zwei Gewichtheben-Wettbewerbe sowie 1966 und 1968 zwei Powerlift-Wettbewerbe.
Reference translation: Schwarzenegger gewann 1964 und 1965 zwei Gewichtheberwettbewerbe sowie 1966 und 1968 zwei Powerlifting-Wettbewerbe .

Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, the term ""Gewichtheben"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""Gewichtheberwettbewerbe."" The reference translation is more accurate, as it specifically refers to weightlifting contests, while ""Gewichtheben"" is the general term for weightlifting.

2. In the machine translation, the term ""Powerlift"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""Powerlifting."" The reference translation is more accurate, as it specifically refers to powerlifting contests, while ""Powerlift"" is not a recognized term in German.

Considering these differences, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the specific terms used in the source text and is more consistent with the context. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: When the squadron became engaged in a dogfight, Wolfram climbed and circled above the fray.
Machine translation: Als sich das Geschwader in einen Dogfight verwickelte, kletterte Wolfram und umkreiste den Kampf.
Reference translation: Als sich das Geschwader in einen Kurvenkampf verwickelte , stieg Wolfram hinauf und umkreiste den Kampf .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""Dogfight"" while the reference translation uses ""Kurvenkampf.""
- The machine translation has ""kletterte"" (climbed) while the reference translation has ""stieg hinauf"" (climbed up).
- The machine translation has ""umkreiste den Kampf"" (circled the fight) while the reference translation has the same phrase.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- ""Dogfight"" is a more common English term for aerial combat, while ""Kurvenkampf"" is a more specific term for a type of aerial combat involving turns and maneuvers. The machine translation is less accurate in this aspect.
- ""Kletterte"" and ""stieg hinauf"" both convey the same meaning of climbing, but ""stieg hinauf"" is more specific and descriptive. The machine translation is slightly less accurate in this aspect.
- The phrase ""umkreiste den Kampf"" is the same in both translations, so there is no difference here.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The use of ""Dogfight"" instead of ""Kurvenkampf"" and ""kletterte"" instead of ""stieg hinauf"" make the machine translation slightly less accurate. However, the overall meaning is still clear and understandable.

1. The machine translation uses ""wurden von"" (were by) while the reference translation uses ""waren"" (were) for the past tense of ""to be."" The machine translation is slightly less accurate in this aspect.
2. The machine translation uses ""heimgesucht"" (plagued) while the reference translation uses ""reich an"" (rich in) to describe the armed conflicts. The machine translation is more dramatic and negative in this aspect.
3. The machine translation and reference translation both accurately translate the rest of the sentence, including the descriptions of local ethnic skirmishes and separatist Islamist insurrections.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor differences in tense and tone compared to the reference translation. The quality of the translation is good, but it could be improved by using the same tense and tone as the reference translation.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-German translation, I will first read and understand the source, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation to determine the quality of the machine translation.

Source: Workers also armored and channelized the creek downstream of Villaview Road by lining the banks with stone blocks.
Machine translation: Die Arbeiter panzerten und kanalisierten den Bach flussabwärts der Villaview Road, indem sie die Ufer mit Steinblöcken aussäten.
Reference translation: Die Arbeiter verstärkten und kanalisierten den Bach flussabwärts der Villaview Road , indem sie die Ufer mit Steinblöcken säumten .

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, the verb ""panzerten"" (armored) is used, while the reference translation uses the verb ""verstärkten"" (strengthened). Although both verbs convey the idea of protection, ""verstärkten"" is more accurate in this context, as it implies that the workers made the banks stronger and more stable.

2. In the machine translation, the verb ""kanalisierten"" (channelized) is used, which is the same as in the reference translation. This verb accurately conveys the action of the workers in directing the flow of the creek.

3. In the machine translation, the phrase ""indem sie die Ufer mit Steinblöcken aussäten"" (lining the banks with stone blocks) is used, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""indem sie die Ufer mit Steinblöcken säumten"" (säumen means to border or line). The machine translation's use of ""aussäten"" (to line) is less accurate than the reference translation's use of ""säumten"" (to border), as the latter better conveys the idea of the workers lining the banks with stone blocks to create a border or barrier.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but it contains some inaccuracies in the choice of verbs and the phrasing of the action. The reference translation is more precise in conveying the workers' actions and the purpose of armoring and channelizing the creek. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is good but not perfect.

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""exponierte"" is used instead of ""freiliegender"" in the reference translation. ""Exponierte"" means ""exposed"" but is not the most accurate translation for ""freiliegender"" in this context.

2. In the machine translation, ""Grünland"" is used instead of ""Grünsand"" in the reference translation. ""Grünland"" means ""green land"" or ""grassland,"" which is not the correct term for greensand in this context. ""Grünsand"" means ""green sand"" and is the correct term for greensand in the context of the source.

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""das Gouvernement"" (the governorship), while the reference translation uses ""die Regierung"" (the government). The difference here is the use of ""Gouvernement"" versus ""Regierung"" for the concept of governance. In this case, ""das Gouvernement"" is more accurate, as it specifically refers to the position of governorship.

2. The machine translation and reference translation are identical in terms of structure and wording, except for the aforementioned difference in the term used for governance.

Based on this analysis, the machine translation is of high quality, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is almost identical to the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""hat eingedrungen"" (has intruded), while the reference translation uses ""weist auf"" (indicates).
2. The machine translation uses ""Lavaströme"" (lava flows), while the reference translation uses ""Einschlüsse von mafischen und rhyolitischen Lavaströmen"" (inclusions of mafic and rhyolitic lava flows).
3. The machine translation uses ""Dioritdeich"" (diorite dike), while the reference translation uses ""Diorit-Gesteinsgang"" (diorite rock mass).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""hat eingedrungen"" (has intruded) in the machine translation is a more direct translation of the source text, while ""weist auf"" (indicates) in the reference translation is a more indirect way of expressing the same idea. Both translations are understandable, but the reference translation is more accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text.
2. The machine translation uses ""Lavaströme"" (lava flows), which is a more general term, while the reference translation uses ""Einschlüsse von mafischen und rhyolitischen Lavaströmen"" (inclusions of mafic and rhyolitic lava flows), which is a more specific term. The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as it captures the specific nature of the lava flows mentioned in the source text.
3. The machine translation uses ""Dioritdeich"" (diorite dike), which is a more general term, while the reference translation uses ""Diorit-Gesteinsgang"" (diorite rock mass), which is a more specific term. The reference translation is more accurate in this case, as it captures the specific nature of the diorite mentioned in the source text.

Conclusion: The reference translation is of higher quality than the machine translation, as it more accurately captures the specific details and nuances of the source text. The machine translation is understandable, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: Early on July 9, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Nakri near western Taiwan.
Machine translation: Am frühen 9. Juli steigerte die JMA die Depression auf den Tropensturm Nakri im Westen Taiwans.
Reference translation: Am frühen 9. Juli stufte die JMA die Depression im Westen Taiwans auf den Tropensturm Nakri hoch .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, the date is written as ""9. Juli"" (9th of July), while in the reference translation, it is written as ""frühen 9. Juli"" (early on the 9th of July).
2. In the machine translation, the verb ""steigerte"" (raised) is used, while in the reference translation, the verb ""stufte"" (classified) is used.
3. In the machine translation, the phrase ""auf den Tropensturm Nakri"" (to Tropical Storm Nakri) is used, while in the reference translation, the phrase ""auf den Tropensturm Nakri hoch"" (to Tropical Storm Nakri up) is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the way the date is written does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence.

Machine translation: Die Bf 109s schlugen Angriffe von 501 und 615 Squadron ab.
Reference translation: Die Bf 109s schlugen Angriffe der Geschwader 501 und 615 zurück .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""von"" (by) while the reference translation uses ""der"" (the) before the numbers 501 and 615.
2. The machine translation uses ""ab"" (off) while the reference translation uses ""zurück"" (back) after ""schlugen.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""von"" vs. ""der"" is a minor difference, as both options are grammatically correct. However, the reference translation's use of ""der"" adds a bit more specificity, indicating that the attacks were from the specific squadrons.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: Behan employed several of the outlaws as sheriff's deputies during their pursuit of Deputy U.S.
Machine translation: Behan beschäftigt mehrere der Gesetzlosen als Sheriffs Stellvertreter während ihrer Verfolgung der stellvertretenden USA
Reference translation: Behan beschäftigte mehrere der Gesetzlosen als Stellvertreter des Sheriffs , während sie die stellvertretenden Vereinigten Staaten verfolgten .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Behan beschäftigt mehrere der Gesetzlosen"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""Behan beschäftigte mehrere der Gesetzlosen"" is used. The difference is the use of the past tense ""beschäftigte"" in the reference translation compared to the present tense ""beschäftigt"" in the machine translation.
2. In the machine translation, ""als Sheriffs Stellvertreter"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""als Stellvertreter des Sheriffs"" is used. The difference is the order of the words, with ""Sheriffs"" and ""Stellvertreter"" switched in the machine translation.
3. In the machine translation, ""während ihrer Verfolgung der stellvertretenden USA"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""während sie die stellvertretenden Vereinigten Staaten verfolgten"" is used. The difference is the use of ""der"" in the machine translation compared to ""die"" in the reference translation, and the use of ""verfolgten"" in the reference translation compared to ""Verfolgung"" in the machine translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of the present tense in the machine translation (""beschäftigt"") instead of the past tense in the reference translation (""beschäftigte"") is a minor error, as it does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence.
2. The order of the words in the machine translation (""als Sheriffs Stellvertreter"") is incorrect compared to the reference translation (""als Stellvertreter des Sheriffs""). This error changes the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the outlaws became deputies of the Sheriffs instead of deputies of a specific Sheriff.
3. The use of ""der"" in the machine translation instead of ""die"" in the reference translation is a minor error, as it does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence.
4. The use of ""Verfolgung"" in the machine translation instead of ""verfolgten"" in the reference translation is a minor error, as it does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some errors in word order and tense, which change the meaning of the sentence. The overall quality of the machine translation is poor.

Machine translation: Amy und Dan verfolgen die Hinweise, während sie sich der Sabotage anderer Cahills entziehen.
Reference translation: Amy und Dan gehen den Hinweisen nach , während sie sich der Sabotage anderer Cahills entziehen .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""verfolgen"" (pursue) is used, while the reference translation uses ""gehen nach"" (follow).
2. In the machine translation, ""sich der Sabotage anderer Cahills entziehen"" (evade the sabotage of other Cahills) is used, while the reference translation uses ""sich der Sabotage anderer Cahills entziehen"" (evade the sabotage of other Cahills).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""verfolgen"" (pursue) instead of ""gehen nach"" (follow) changes the meaning slightly. ""Pursue"" implies actively chasing or seeking out the clues, while ""follow"" implies more of a passive following of the clues. This difference in meaning may affect the overall understanding of the sentence.
2. The use of the same phrase ""sich der Sabotage anderer Cahills entziehen"" (evade the sabotage of other Cahills) in both the machine and reference translations indicates that this part of the sentence is accurately translated.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the use of ""verfolgen"" (pursue) instead of ""gehen nach"" (follow) changes the meaning slightly and may affect the overall understanding of the sentence. The translation quality is good, but not perfect due to this difference in meaning.

1. In the source text, the term ""ridership"" is used, which refers to the number of passengers. In the machine translation, the term ""Zugehörigkeit"" (affiliation) is used, which is not the correct term for ridership. The reference translation correctly uses ""Fahrgastzahlen"" (passenger numbers).

2. In the source text, the term ""daily"" is used to describe the average number of passengers per day. In the machine translation, the term ""tages"" (daily) is used, but it is not combined with the term ""Wochentags"" (weekday) as it should be. The reference translation correctly uses ""Tages"" (daily) and ""Wochentags"" (weekday) to describe the average number of passengers for each respective day type.

3. In the source text, the term ""weekday"" is used to describe the average number of passengers on weekdays. In the machine translation, the term ""Wochentagszugehörigkeit"" (weekday affiliation) is used, which is not the correct term for weekday ridership. The reference translation correctly uses ""Wochentags-Fahrgastzahlen"" (weekday passenger numbers).

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation.

Reference translation: Im französischen Nationalgestüt sind alte Sättel , Kutschen , eine Bauernwerkstatt usw. ausgestellt .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""zeigt"" (shows) while the reference translation uses ""sind ausgestellt"" (are exhibited).
2. The machine translation places ""usw."" (etc.) after ""eine Bauernwerkstatt"" (a farmer's workshop), while the reference translation places it after ""Kutschen"" (carriages).
3. The machine translation does not include the preposition ""im"" (in) before ""französischen Nationalgestüt"" (French national stud).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""zeigt"" instead of ""sind ausgestellt"" changes the meaning slightly. The reference translation implies that the items are exhibited in the French national stud, while the machine translation simply states that the French national stud shows these items.
2. The placement of ""usw."" affects the flow of the sentence. The reference translation's placement makes more sense, as it lists the items that are exhibited before mentioning ""etc.""
3. The omission of ""im"" before ""französischen Nationalgestüt"" is a minor error, but it does affect the grammatical correctness of the sentence.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in meaning and grammar compared to the reference translation. The quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by addressing these differences.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Cilicia Rubenid dynasty List of monarchs of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia
Machine translation: Liste der Monarchen des armenischen Königreichs Zilizien
Reference translation: Dynastie der Rubeniden Kilikien Liste der Monarchen des armenischen Königreichs Kilikien

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Zilizien"" is used instead of ""Kilikien"" in the reference translation.
2. In the machine translation, ""armenischen Königreichs"" is used instead of ""armenischen Königreichs"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the name of the region (Zilizien vs. Kilikien) is a significant error, as it changes the meaning of the translation. Kilikien is the correct name of the region, and Zilizien is not a recognized name.
2. The difference in the preposition ""des"" vs. ""des"" in the machine translation is a minor error and does not significantly impact the meaning of the translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is poor due to the significant error in the name of the region. The minor error in the preposition does not significantly impact the meaning of the translation, but it still detracts from the overall quality. A better machine translation would be:

""Liste der Monarchen der armenischen Königreichs Kilikien""

Source: P. dominula generally lives in temperate, terrestrial habitats such as chaparral, forest, and grassland biomes.
Machine translation: P. dominula lebt im Allgemeinen in gemäßigten, terrestrischen Lebensräumen wie Chaparral, Forest und Grasland Biomes.
Reference translation: P. dominula lebt im Allgemeinen in gemäßigten , terrestrischen Lebensräumen wie Chaparral- , Wald- und Grünlandbiomen .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Chaparral, Forest und Grasland Biomes"" while the reference translation uses ""Chaparral- , Wald- und Grünlandbiomen"". The reference translation includes hyphens and additional terms for ""forest"" and ""grassland"" (Wald and Grünlandbiomen).
2. The machine translation uses ""im Allgemeinen"" while the reference translation uses ""generally"".

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation captures the overall meaning of the source text, but it is not as precise as the reference translation. The use of ""Chaparral, Forest und Grasland Biomes"" is less specific than ""Chaparral- , Wald- und Grünlandbiomen"".
2. The use of ""im Allgemeinen"" is a correct translation of ""generally"", so this part of the machine translation is accurate.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it is less precise than the reference translation. The differences in the translation of ""chaparral"", ""forest"", and ""grassland"" biomes make the machine translation slightly less accurate.

Difference: The machine translation omits the definite article ""der"" before ""Kaplan.""

2. Machine translation: während die Crew von Tegetthoff auf ihren Decks auftauchte
Reference translation: während die Crew der Tegetthoff auf ihr Deck hervortrat
Difference: The machine translation uses ""ihren Decks"" instead of ""ihrem Deck"" and ""auftauchte"" instead of ""hervortrat.""

3. Machine translation: um das sinkende Schiff zu grüßen
Reference translation: um dem sinkenden Schiff zu salutieren
Difference: The machine translation uses ""zu grüßen"" instead of ""zu salutieren.""

Now, let's evaluate the quality of the English-German translation:

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences compared to the reference translation:

1. The omission of the definite article ""der"" before ""Kaplan"" in the machine translation slightly affects the clarity of the sentence.
2. The use of ""ihren Decks"" instead of ""ihrem Deck"" and ""auftauchte"" instead of ""hervortrat"" in the machine translation makes the sentence less accurate.
3. The use of ""zu grüßen"" instead of ""zu salutieren"" in the machine translation changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""grüßen"" means ""to greet"" in a more general sense, while ""salutieren"" specifically means ""to salute.""

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has some minor inaccuracies that affect the clarity and meaning of the sentence. The quality of the English-German translation can be considered as ""good"" with some room for improvement.

Machine translation: Die Wale wurden vom Ufer gefleckt, dann gejagt und immer wieder aus dem Schleife einer Schallop lanciert.
Reference translation: Die Wale wurden vom Ufer aus gesichtet , dann wiederholt vom Bug einer Schaluppe gejagt und harpuniert .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- ""gefleckt"" (spotted) vs. ""gesichtet"" (sighted)
- ""gejagt"" (chased) is the same in both translations
- ""immer wieder aus dem Schleife einer Schallop lanciert"" (repeatedly lanced from the loop of a shallop) vs. ""vom Bug einer Schaluppe gejagt und harpuniert"" (chased and harpooned from the bow of a skiff)

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- ""gefleckt"" vs. ""gesichtet"": Both words mean to see or observe something, but ""gesichtet"" is more accurate in this context as it implies that the whales were observed from a distance. ""Gefleckt"" could be interpreted as the whales were marked or branded, which is not the intended meaning.
- ""aus dem Schleife einer Schallop lanciert"" vs. ""vom Bug einer Schaluppe gejagt und harpuniert"": The machine translation uses ""Schallop"" instead of ""Schaluppe,"" which is a typo. Additionally, the machine translation describes the whales being lanced ""from the loop of a shallop,"" which is an incorrect and confusing description. The reference translation correctly describes the whales being chased and harpooned ""from the bow of a skiff.""

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has some inaccuracies and confusing descriptions compared to the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The use of ""Die afro"" vs. ""Der Afro"" is a minor difference in gender agreement. Both translations convey the same meaning.
2. The use of ""schwarze Frisur"" vs. ""afroamerikanische Frisur"" is a difference in the specificity of the hairstyle. ""Schwarze Frisur"" means ""black hairstyle"" in general, while ""afroamerikanische Frisur"" specifically refers to ""Afro-American hairstyle"". The reference translation is more specific and accurate in this case.
3. The use of ""bis in die späten 1970er Jahre"" vs. ""bis Ende der 1970er Jahre"" is a minor difference in phrasing. Both translations convey the same meaning, that the hairstyle remained popular until the end of the 1970s.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the specificity of the reference translation in describing the hairstyle as ""Afro-American"".

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Doubleday's regiments retired to the turnpike in an orderly fashion.
Machine translation: Doubleday Regiments zog sich in geordneter Weise in den Turnhecht zurück.
Reference translation: Doubledays Regimenter zogen sich in geordneter Weise zum Schlagbaum zurück.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""Turnpike"" is translated as ""Turnhecht"" in the machine translation, while it is translated as ""Schlagbaum"" in the reference translation.
2. ""Regiments"" is translated as ""Regimenter"" in the reference translation, while it is translated as ""Regiments"" in the machine translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. ""Turnpike"" is a term used in English to refer to a toll road or a toll gate. In German, ""Schlagbaum"" is the correct term for a toll gate, while ""Turnhecht"" is not a common or correct term in German. This indicates a mistake in the machine translation.
2. The difference in the translation of ""Regiments"" to ""Regimenter"" is due to the grammatical gender in German. ""Regiments"" is the correct translation for the plural form of ""regiment"" in German, while ""Regimenter"" is not the correct translation. This indicates another mistake in the machine translation.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the incorrect translation of ""turnpike"" and the incorrect grammatical gender for ""regiments."" The reference translation is more accurate and should be considered the better translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 First, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, the phrase ""liebte ihn nicht, sich zu mäßigen"" is used, while in the reference translation, it is ""machte ihn bei den Moderaten nicht beliebt."" The machine translation is not conveying the same meaning as the reference translation. The correct phrase should be ""machte ihn bei den Moderaten nicht beliebt"" to convey that his uncompromising attitude did not endear him to moderates.

2. In the machine translation, the phrase ""und seine Arroganz und Unflexibilität hemmten seine Effektivität als Gesetzgeber oft"" is used, while in the reference translation, it is ""sein Arroganz und sein Mangel an Flexibilität hemmten oft seine Effektivität als Gesetzgeber."" The machine translation is not conveying the same meaning as the reference translation. The correct phrase should be ""sein Arroganz und sein Mangel an Flexibilität hemmten oft seine Effektivität als Gesetzgeber"" to convey that his arrogance and inflexibility often inhibited his effectiveness as a legislator.

Considering these differences, the quality of the English-German machine translation is not very high. The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text, and there are errors in the phrasing. The translation would need to be revised to better match the reference translation and accurately convey the meaning of the source text.

Source: Boars in the former area will also feed on cormorant and heron chicks, bivalved molluscs, trapped muskrats and mice.

Machine translation: Wildschweine im ehemaligen Gebiet werden auch von Kormoran- und Reiher-Küken, bivalvierten Weichtieren, gefangenen Bisamratten und Mäusen ernährt.

Reference translation: Wildschweine im ehemaligen Gebiet ernähren sich auch von Kormoran- und Reiher-Küken , Muscheln , gefangenen Bisamratten und Mäusen .

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""ernährt"" (fed) while the reference translation uses ""ernähren sich"" (feed on). The latter is more appropriate in this context, as it conveys the idea of the boars feeding on the mentioned items.
2. The machine translation uses ""bivalvierten Weichtieren"" (bivalved molluscs), while the reference translation uses ""Muscheln"" (muscles). The reference translation is more accurate, as ""muscles"" is a more specific term for the type of molluscs mentioned in the source.
3. The machine translation uses ""gefangenen Bisamratten"" (trapped muskrats), while the reference translation uses ""gefangenen Bisamratten"" (captured muskrats). The meaning is the same, but the reference translation is more concise.
4. The machine translation uses ""Mäusen"" (mice), while the reference translation also uses ""Mäusen"" (mice). Both translations are accurate.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in word choice and conciseness that make the reference translation slightly better. The machine translation could be improved by using ""ernähren sich"" instead of ""ernährt"" and ""Muscheln"" instead of ""bivalvierten Weichtieren"".

- The machine translation omits the word ""erneut"" (again) from the end of the sentence, which slightly changes the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation implies that the fatal blow is happening again, while the machine translation does not emphasize this aspect as strongly.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor differences from the reference translation. The use of ""wieder"" instead of ""erneut"" and the omission of ""erneut"" at the end of the sentence slightly change the meaning of the sentence. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using ""erneut"" and including it at the end of the sentence.

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, the campus size is given as 5200 hectares plus 350 hectares, while in the reference translation, it is given as 2104 hectares plus 142 hectares. The source text mentions 5200 acres plus 350 acres, which is approximately 2104 hectares plus 142 hectares. The machine translation seems to have overestimated the size of the campus.

2. The machine translation does not mention the name ""Texas A&M University"" in the sentence, while the reference translation does. This is an important detail that should be included in the translation.

3. The machine translation uses the term ""umfasst"" (encompasses), while the reference translation uses ""erstreckt sich über"" (extends over). Both terms can be used to describe the size of a campus, but ""erstreckt sich über"" is more commonly used in this context in German.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has some issues with the size of the campus and the inclusion of the university name. However, the general meaning is still conveyed, and the translation is mostly understandable.

Machine translation: Das Ministerium für Arbeit und Industrie besetzte auch das Ordnance Store.
Reference translation: Das Ministerium für Arbeit und Industrie besetzte auch den Ordnance Store.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""das Ordnance Store"" while the reference translation uses ""den Ordnance Store.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- In German, the definite article changes depending on the gender, case, and number of the noun it modifies. ""Ordnance Store"" is a compound noun in English, and in German, it would be ""Ordnance-Store."" The gender of a compound noun in German is determined by the first element of the compound. In this case, ""Ordnance"" is a masculine noun, so ""Ordnance-Store"" is also masculine.
- The machine translation incorrectly uses the neuter article ""das"" instead of the masculine article ""den."" This is a minor error, but it affects the grammatical correctness of the sentence.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it contains a small grammatical error in the use of the definite article. This error does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does affect the grammatical correctness.
