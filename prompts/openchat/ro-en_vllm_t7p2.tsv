0	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Romanian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: adîncă pecete pe sufletul viitorului poet, iar opera lui o va mărturisi cu vădită
Machine translation: hallmark the soul of the future poet and his work will confess him clearly.
Reference translation: deep seals on the soul of the future poet , and his work will clearly testify to it

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""hallmark"" vs. ""deep seals""
2. ""the soul of the future poet"" vs. ""the soul of the future poet""
3. ""his work will confess him clearly"" vs. ""his work will clearly testify to it""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. ""hallmark"" is not an accurate translation of ""adîncă pecete,"" which means ""deep seal."" The reference translation correctly translates this phrase as ""deep seals.""
2. Both the machine translation and the reference translation correctly translate ""sufletul viitorului poet"" as ""the soul of the future poet.""
3. The machine translation uses ""confess"" and ""clearly,"" while the reference translation uses ""testify"" and ""clearly."" Both translations convey the meaning of the original text, but the reference translation is more accurate in this case.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of high quality, as it contains inaccuracies in the translation of ""adîncă pecete"" and the choice of words in the last part of the sentence. The reference translation is more accurate and better captures the meaning of the original text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

1	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Romanian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: La 4 iunie 1908, cu ocazia transferului cenușei lui Émile Zola la Panthéon, Alfred Dreyfus a fost victima unui atentat.
Machine translation: On 4 June 1908, when the ash was transferred to Émile Zola in Panthéon, Alfred Dreyfus was the victim of an attack.
Reference translation: On 4 June 1908 on the occasion of the transfer of the ashes of Émile Zola to the Pantheon , Alfred Dreyfus was the target of an attack .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""when"" while the reference translation uses ""on the occasion of.""
2. The machine translation says ""the ash was transferred to Émile Zola in Panthéon"" while the reference translation says ""the transfer of the ashes of Émile Zola to the Pantheon.""
3. The machine translation says ""Alfred Dreyfus was the victim of an attack"" while the reference translation says ""Alfred Dreyfus was the target of an attack.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""when"" in the machine translation is less precise than ""on the occasion of"" in the reference translation. The source text implies that the attack on Alfred Dreyfus was related to the transfer of Émile Zola's ashes, and ""on the occasion of"" better conveys this relationship.
2. The machine translation incorrectly states that the ashes were transferred ""in Panthéon"" instead of ""to the Pantheon."" This changes the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the ashes were transferred inside the Panthéon, rather than to the Panthéon.
3. The machine translation uses ""victim"" while the reference translation uses ""target."" Although both words can be used to describe someone who is attacked, ""target"" is more appropriate in this context, as it implies that Alfred Dreyfus was specifically chosen for the attack.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of low quality, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and contains several errors. The reference translation is more accurate and better conveys the meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The date format difference is minor and does not significantly impact the overall meaning or quality of the translation.
2. The use of ""called"" vs. ""demanded"" changes the tone of the sentence slightly. ""Demanded"" implies a stronger, more urgent request, while ""called"" is more passive. However, this difference does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the translation.
3. The phrase ""an immediate cease fire"" is more specific and accurate than ""an immediate end to peace."" A cease fire refers to a temporary halt in hostilities, while ""an end to peace"" is a more general phrase that could be interpreted in various ways. This difference does impact the overall quality of the translation, as the machine translation is less accurate in this regard.

1. The machine translation uses ""it"" instead of ""he"" to refer to Wowereit.
2. The machine translation uses ""from office"" instead of ""from function"" to describe the position Wowereit is resigning from.
3. The machine translation does not use commas to separate the date from the rest of the sentence.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. Using ""it"" instead of ""he"" is a minor error, as both pronouns can be used to refer to a male person. However, ""he"" is more appropriate in this context.
2. Using ""from office"" instead of ""from function"" changes the meaning slightly. ""From function"" is more accurate, as it refers to a specific position or role, while ""from office"" could be interpreted as resigning from a general office space.
3. The lack of commas in the machine translation makes it less clear and less natural in English. Commas are important for separating different parts of a sentence and providing clarity.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it contains some minor errors and lacks the clarity of the reference translation. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by addressing the issues mentioned above.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

19	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Romanian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: De la Angliei, Scoției și Irlandei în 1603, ea a apărut pe un sfert din scutul stemei Regatului Unit.
Machine translation: Since England, Scotland and Ireland in 1603, it appeared on a quarter of the shield of the United Kingdom.
Reference translation: From England , Scotland and Ireland in 1603 , she appeared on a quarter of the coat of arms of the United Kingdom .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Since"" while the reference translation uses ""From"".
2. The machine translation uses ""it"" as a pronoun, while the reference translation uses ""she"" as a pronoun.
3. The machine translation uses ""shield"" while the reference translation uses ""coat of arms"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""Since"" and ""From"" are both appropriate in this context, so this difference does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.
2. The use of ""it"" versus ""she"" is a minor difference, as both pronouns can be used to refer to the symbol appearing on the coat of arms. However, ""she"" is more appropriate in this context, as it gives the symbol a more personified quality.
3. The use of ""shield"" instead of ""coat of arms"" is a more significant difference, as ""shield"" is a more general term, while ""coat of arms"" is more specific and accurate. This difference impacts the quality of the translation, as the machine translation is less precise than the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor inaccuracies that impact its quality. The use of ""shield"" instead of ""coat of arms"" is the most significant difference, making the machine translation less precise than the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: În același timp, forțele armate ale principalelor puteri ale Antantei au fost preocupate să organizeze acțiuni ofensive pe frontul de vest.
Machine translation: At the same time, the armed forces of the main powers of the Antarctic have been concerned to organise offensive actions on the western front.
Reference translation: At the same time , the armed forces of the main Entente powers were preoccupied with organizing offensive actions on the Western Front .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""Antantei"" is translated as ""Antarctic"" in the machine translation, while it is translated as ""Entente"" in the reference translation.
2. ""preocupate"" is translated as ""concerned"" in the machine translation, while it is translated as ""preoccupied"" in the reference translation.
3. ""frontul de vest"" is translated as ""western front"" in the machine translation, while it is translated as ""Western Front"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The translation of ""Antantei"" as ""Antarctic"" is incorrect. The correct translation is ""Entente."" This error changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""Antarctic"" refers to the southernmost continent, while ""Entente"" refers to an alliance or understanding between countries.
2. The translation of ""preocupate"" as ""concerned"" is acceptable, as both words convey a similar meaning. However, the reference translation uses the word ""preoccupied,"" which is a more accurate translation of ""preocupate.""
3. The translation of ""frontul de vest"" as ""western front"" is acceptable, as both phrases refer to the same geographical location. However, the reference translation uses the capitalized phrase ""Western Front,"" which is more accurate, as it refers to a specific historical event (World War I) and military campaign.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of moderate quality. It captures the general meaning of the source text but contains some inaccuracies and lacks the specificity of the reference translation.

Reference translation: The teacher put a word in with the captain , who sent a courier with a letter and with those people to the officers in Petros , and the massacres stopped .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. ""The teacher intervened in the captain"" vs. ""The teacher put a word in with the captain""
2. ""who sent a courier a letter to those people also at Petros's officers"" vs. ""who sent a courier with a letter and with those people to the officers in Petros""
3. ""and stopped the massacres"" vs. ""and the massacres stopped""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The phrase ""put a word in"" is more idiomatic and natural in English compared to ""intervened in the captain.""
2. The machine translation incorrectly states ""also at Petros's officers,"" which is not clear and deviates from the source. The reference translation correctly states ""to the officers in Petros.""
3. The machine translation uses ""stopped the massacres,"" while the reference translation uses ""the massacres stopped."" Both are grammatically correct, but the reference translation is more idiomatic.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has some issues with phrasing and clarity, but it generally conveys the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is more idiomatic and clear in some parts, making it a better translation. The overall quality of the machine translation is fair, but it could be improved.

Source: Germania Nazistă a ocupat în întregime teritoriul olandez.
Machine translation: Nazist Germany has occupied entirely Dutch territory.
Reference translation: The Nazist Germany has entirely occupied the Dutch territory.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""Nazist Germany"" while the reference translation uses ""The Nazist Germany.""
- The machine translation uses ""has occupied entirely"" while the reference translation uses ""has entirely occupied.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the beginning (""The"" in reference translation) is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
- The difference in the verb placement (""has occupied entirely"" vs. ""has entirely occupied"") is also a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is of high quality, with only minor differences compared to the reference translation. The differences do not significantly impact the overall meaning or quality of the translation.

Machine translation: The time has come to add an ethical dimension to at least some cars.
Reference translation: It 's time to add an ethical dimension to at least some of the cars .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""The time has come"" while the reference translation uses ""It's time.""
- The machine translation uses ""to at least some cars"" while the reference translation uses ""to at least some of the cars.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the beginning phrase (""The time has come"" vs. ""It's time"") does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both phrases convey the same idea that the time has arrived for a certain action.
- The difference in the phrase ""to at least some cars"" vs. ""to at least some of the cars"" is more significant. The reference translation is more accurate, as it specifies that an ethical dimension is to be added to some of the cars, not just any cars.

Source: Tinerețea lui Zola este însă frământată și de alte pasiuni.
Machine translation: Zola's youth, however, is also grounded by other passion.
Reference translation: However , Zola 's youth is troubled by other passions .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""grounded"" while the reference translation uses ""troubled.""
- The machine translation uses ""also"" while the reference translation uses ""however.""
- The machine translation uses ""and"" while the reference translation does not.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of ""grounded"" instead of ""troubled"" changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Grounded"" implies a stable or secure feeling, while ""troubled"" implies a disturbed or unsettled feeling.
- The use of ""also"" instead of ""however"" changes the emphasis of the sentence. ""Also"" implies that there are multiple factors affecting Zola's youth, while ""however"" implies that there is a contrast between the effect of these passions and some other factor.
- The use of ""and"" in the machine translation is unnecessary and does not add any meaning to the sentence.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not of high quality because it changes the meaning of the source text and adds unnecessary words. The reference translation more accurately captures the meaning of the source text and is more concise.

Machine translation: Soon he forced German troops to withdraw from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland.
Reference translation: Soon after , he forced German troops to withdraw from western Ukraine and eastern Poland .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation does not include the word ""after"" in the phrase ""Soon after.""
- The machine translation uses ""Western Ukraine"" and ""Eastern Poland,"" while the reference translation uses ""western Ukraine"" and ""eastern Poland"" (with lowercase ""w"" and ""e"").

- The omission of ""after"" in the machine translation slightly affects the flow of the sentence, but the overall meaning is still clear.
- The capitalization difference in ""Western Ukraine"" and ""Eastern Poland"" is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Ultimai treizeci de ani ai secolului 19 sunt dominați cultural de societatea Junimea.
Machine translation: The 19th century last thirty years are culturally dominated by Junta.
Reference translation: The last thirty years of the 19th century are culturally dominated by the Junimea society.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""The 19th century last thirty years"" vs. Reference translation: ""The last thirty years of the 19th century""
- Machine translation: ""culturally dominated by Junta"" vs. Reference translation: ""culturally dominated by the Junimea society""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The first difference is a slight rephrasing of the time period. The machine translation places ""last"" before ""thirty years,"" while the reference translation places ""last"" before ""thirty years of the 19th century."" This difference does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.
- The second difference is a significant error in the machine translation. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Junimea"" as ""Junta,"" which is a completely different word with a different meaning. The reference translation correctly translates ""Junimea"" as ""Junimea society.""

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has one major error and one minor difference compared to the reference translation. The major error in the translation of ""Junimea"" to ""Junta"" significantly impacts the meaning of the sentence and reduces the overall quality of the translation. The minor difference in the phrasing of the time period does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is low due to the major error in translating ""Junimea"" to ""Junta.""

Source: Calitatea scăzută a pregătirii soldaților nu a fost contrabalansată de existența unui corp numeros ofițeri și subofițeri profesioniști.
Machine translation: The low quality of training for the soldiers has not been counterbalanced by the existence of a large body of professional officers and non-officers.
Reference translation: The low quality of training for the soldiers has not been counterbalanced by the existence of a large body of professional officers and petty officers.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""non-officers"" while the reference translation uses ""petty officers.""

Step 3: Determine if the differences affect the quality of the translation.
- The difference between ""non-officers"" and ""petty officers"" is significant. ""Non-officers"" refers to all soldiers who are not officers, while ""petty officers"" specifically refers to lower-ranking officers. The reference translation is more accurate because it specifies the lower-ranking officers as the counterbalance to the low quality of training for the soldiers.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation because it does not specify lower-ranking officers as the counterbalance to the low quality of training for the soldiers. The reference translation is more precise and provides a clearer understanding of the original source.

Step 5: Provide a final evaluation of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation due to the omission of ""petty officers"" as the counterbalance to the low quality of training for the soldiers. The reference translation is more accurate and provides a clearer understanding of the original source.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: iar al doilea face mintea una cu Dumnezeu prin deprinderea
Machine translation: and the second makes one mind with God by living in
Reference translation: and the second makes the mind one with God through habit

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. Machine translation: ""makes one mind"" vs. Reference translation: ""makes the mind""
2. Machine translation: ""by living in"" vs. Reference translation: ""through habit""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""makes one mind"" instead of ""makes the mind,"" which is a slight difference in phrasing but conveys the same meaning. This difference does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.
2. The machine translation uses ""by living in"" instead of ""through habit."" This difference changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""by living in"" implies a more permanent state of being, while ""through habit"" implies a more ongoing process. This difference negatively impacts the quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the difference in phrasing between ""by living in"" and ""through habit"" affects the meaning of the sentence and reduces the quality of the translation.

Reference translation: According to the WWF , the territory of Estonia belongs to the Sarmatian mixed forest ecoregion .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""ecosystem"" while the reference translation uses ""ecoregion.""
2. The machine translation uses ""sarmatic blending forests"" while the reference translation uses ""Sarmatian mixed forest.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""ecosystem"" instead of ""ecoregion"" is a minor difference, as both terms refer to a geographic area with distinct biological characteristics. However, ""ecoregion"" is more specific and accurate in this context.

3. ""which many years ago saw such a flame"" vs. ""who many years ago saw such a flame""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. ""The same source stories"" vs. ""The same source says"": The machine translation uses an incorrect phrasing, as ""The same source stories"" is not a correct way to express the idea. The reference translation uses ""The same source says,"" which is more accurate.

2. ""a bolder per capita"" vs. ""a more daring inhabitant"": The machine translation uses an incorrect and unclear phrase, ""a bolder per capita,"" which does not make sense in this context. The reference translation uses ""a more daring inhabitant,"" which is a more accurate and clear expression of the idea.

3. ""which many years ago saw such a flame"" vs. ""who many years ago saw such a flame"": The machine translation uses the pronoun ""which"" instead of the pronoun ""who,"" which is incorrect in this context. The reference translation uses ""who,"" which is the correct pronoun to use when referring to a person.

Conclusion: The machine translation has several inaccuracies and unclear expressions compared to the reference translation. The quality of the machine translation is low.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: La vremea respectivă, Consiliul de Securitate al ONU a declarat faptul că „au fost folosite arme chimice în lupte”.
Machine translation: At that time, the UN Security Council stated that it had used chemical weapons in battle.
Reference translation: At the time , the UN Security Council said that "" chemical weapons were used in the fighting . ""

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""At that time"" while the reference translation uses ""At the time"".
2. The machine translation uses ""the UN Security Council stated that it had used chemical weapons in battle"" while the reference translation uses ""the UN Security Council said that "" chemical weapons were used in the fighting .""""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the phrase ""At that time"" and ""At the time"" does not significantly impact the meaning or quality of the translation. Both phrases are commonly used and convey the same idea of a specific point in time.
2. The machine translation's use of ""the UN Security Council stated that it had used chemical weapons in battle"" is a slight deviation from the reference translation's ""the UN Security Council said that "" chemical weapons were used in the fighting ."""" The machine translation's phrasing is less accurate, as it implies that the UN Security Council directly used chemical weapons, while the reference translation correctly states that chemical weapons were used in the fighting.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there is a slight deviation in the phrasing related to the use of chemical weapons. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by more accurately conveying the information from the source.

Source: Revendicările germane au fost apropiate de pierderile raportate oficial de aliați.
Machine translation: The German claims were close to the losses officially reported by allies.
Reference translation: The German claims were close to the losses officially reported by the Allies.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""allies"" while the reference translation uses ""the Allies.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The use of ""the Allies"" in the reference translation adds a specificity to the term ""allies,"" referring to a specific group of countries that were allied during a particular historical event, such as World War II. In contrast, ""allies"" in the machine translation is more general and could refer to any group of allied countries.

Step 4: Determine the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.
- The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the use of ""allies"" instead of ""the Allies"" makes it slightly less precise than the reference translation. The difference, however, is minor and does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using ""the Allies"" instead of ""allies"" to match the reference translation more closely.

- ""dealt with"" vs. ""approached""
- ""attacking the combined forces"" vs. ""the "" combined forces "" attack""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- ""dealt with"" vs. ""approached"": The verb ""dealt with"" implies that the German land army has already found a solution to the problem, while ""approached"" suggests that they are still in the process of finding a solution. The reference translation is more accurate in this regard, as it conveys the ongoing nature of the problem.
- ""attacking the combined forces"" vs. ""the "" combined forces "" attack"": The machine translation uses a passive voice, while the reference translation uses an active voice. The reference translation is more accurate, as it clearly states that the German ground army is the one carrying out the attack.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The differences in verb tense and voice make the machine translation less clear and less faithful to the original source.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Ei găsesc un maestru spărgător numit DJ și decolează înapoi spre Rezistență, aflată în pericol.
Machine translation: They find a scattered maestor called DJ and take off back to the endangered resistance.
Reference translation: They find a master burglar named DJ and take off back to the endangered Resistance.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. ""scattered maestor"" vs. ""master burglar""
2. ""endangered resistance"" vs. ""endangered Resistance""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
1. ""scattered maestor"" vs. ""master burglar"": The machine translation uses the word ""scattered"" to describe the maestor, which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly uses ""master burglar"" to describe the character.
2. ""endangered resistance"" vs. ""endangered Resistance"": The machine translation uses lowercase for ""resistance,"" while the reference translation uses uppercase for ""Resistance."" This difference is likely due to the reference translation treating ""Resistance"" as a proper noun, while the machine translation does not.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has some inaccuracies and differences compared to the reference translation. The translation of ""maestru spărgător"" as ""scattered maestor"" is not accurate, and the capitalization of ""resistance"" is incorrect.

- The machine translation uses ""Jewish"" and ""Brittany"" while the reference translation uses ""Judea"" and ""Britain.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of ""It"" instead of ""He"" is a minor error, as both pronouns can be used to refer to a person or entity. However, ""He"" is more appropriate in this context.
- The use of ""uprisings"" instead of ""riots"" is a minor difference in meaning, as both words can describe a rebellion or act of defiance. However, ""riots"" is more appropriate in this context, as it implies a more violent and chaotic situation.
- The use of ""Jewish"" instead of ""Judea"" is a significant error, as ""Jewish"" is an adjective describing a people or culture, while ""Judea"" is a proper noun referring to a specific region. Similarly, the use of ""Brittany"" instead of ""Britain"" is an error, as ""Brittany"" is a region in France, while ""Britain"" refers to the United Kingdom.

291	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Romanian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Până în vara 1791, în Clubul iacobinilor au dominat reprezentanții monarhismului liberal constituțional.
Machine translation: Until the summer of 1791, representatives of liberal constitutional monarchism dominated in the Jacobins Club.
Reference translation: Until the summer of 1791 , the Jacobin Club was dominated by representatives of the constitutional liberal monarchy .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation places ""representatives of liberal constitutional monarchism"" at the beginning of the sentence, while the reference translation places ""the Jacobin Club was dominated by representatives of the constitutional liberal monarchy"" at the beginning.
2. The machine translation uses ""in the Jacobins Club"" while the reference translation uses ""the Jacobin Club.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The placement of the phrase ""representatives of liberal constitutional monarchism"" at the beginning of the machine translation makes the sentence structure different from the reference translation. The reference translation places the focus on the Jacobin Club being dominated, while the machine translation places the focus on the representatives dominating in the club.
2. The use of ""in the Jacobins Club"" in the machine translation is grammatically correct, but it is less formal than the reference translation's ""the Jacobin Club."" Additionally, the machine translation uses ""Jacobins Club"" instead of ""Jacobin Club,"" which is the correct form.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some differences in sentence structure and formality compared to the reference translation. The machine translation conveys the same overall meaning as the reference translation, but the differences in structure and formality may affect the quality of the translation.

4. The translation of ""dezgust"" as ""disguise"" is a significant error. ""Dezgust"" means ""disgust"" in Romanian, and the correct translation should be ""disgust"" to convey the intended meaning.
5. The translation of ""rândul criticilor"" as ""among the critics"" is acceptable, as it conveys the same meaning (the critics' reactions).

Overall, the machine translation has some errors, particularly in translating ""dezgust"" as ""disguise."" However, most of the other differences are minor and do not significantly impact the meaning of the text. The quality of the machine translation can be considered as mostly accurate but with some errors.

359	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Romanian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Acest subiect a început de curând să fie discutat în publicațiile academice ca o adevărată sursă de risc pentru civilizație, oameni și planeta Pământ.
Machine translation: This topic has recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risk to civilisation, people and planet Earth.
Reference translation: This topic has recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risk for civilization , humans and planet Earth .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""civilisation"" while the reference translation uses ""civilization"".
2. The machine translation uses ""to"" while the reference translation uses ""for"" before ""civilization"".
3. The machine translation uses ""people"" while the reference translation uses ""humans"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the spelling of ""civilisation"" and ""civilization"" is a minor issue, as both are correct spellings, although the American English spelling is ""civilization"". This does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
2. The difference in the use of ""to"" and ""for"" before ""civilization"" is more significant. The machine translation implies that the topic is a risk ""to"" civilisation, while the reference translation implies that the topic is a risk ""for"" civilization. The difference in prepositions changes the meaning slightly, as ""to"" implies a threat to the existence of civilization, while ""for"" implies a risk that could affect civilization. This difference in meaning could impact the overall quality of the translation.
3. The difference in the use of ""people"" and ""humans"" is minor, as both words are synonymous and can be used interchangeably in this context. This does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in meaning due to the choice of prepositions and the use of synonyms. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement to ensure the meaning is accurately conveyed.

Machine translation: His work was received with a great deal of reservation, even with hostility.
Reference translation: His works were received with a great deal of reserve , even with hostility .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""work"" while the reference translation uses ""works.""
- The machine translation uses ""reservation"" while the reference translation uses ""reserve.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the use of ""work"" vs. ""works"" is a minor error, as both can be correct in this context. However, the reference translation is more consistent with the source text, which uses the plural form ""Lucrările sale"" (His works).
- The difference in the use of ""reservation"" vs. ""reserve"" is a more significant error. ""Reservation"" is not the correct translation for ""rezervă"" in this context. The correct translation should be ""reserve,"" as used in the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but there are some errors in the translation of specific words. The machine translation captures the general meaning of the source text, but the errors in word choice reduce its accuracy.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""submitted"" while the reference translation uses ""subjected.""
- The machine translation uses ""sadic"" while the reference translation uses ""sadistic.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- ""Submitted"" and ""subjected"" have similar meanings, but ""subjected"" is more appropriate in this context as it implies a more forceful action.
- ""Sadic"" is an incorrect form of the adjective ""sadistic."" The correct form is ""sadistic.""

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it contains two errors: the use of ""submitted"" instead of ""subjected"" and the use of ""sadic"" instead of ""sadistic."" These errors affect the overall quality of the translation.

Step 5: Provide a final evaluation.
The quality of the machine translation is moderate. While it captures the main idea of the source text, it contains two errors that affect its accuracy. A better translation would be: ""For four years, Rome was subjected to the sadistic regime of Caligula.""
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: Moreover, he claimed that an ideology cannot be condemned for committing crimes on his behalf.
Reference translation: Moreover , he argued that an ideology could not be condemned because crimes had been committed in its name .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""committing crimes on his behalf"" while the reference translation uses ""crimes had been committed in its name.""
2. The machine translation uses ""Moreover"" while the reference translation uses ""Moreover ,"" (with a comma).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the phrase ""committing crimes on his behalf"" vs. ""crimes had been committed in its name"" changes the meaning of the sentence.

Reference translation: Europeans brought horses , cats , cattle , and pigs to the Americans , and in return returned to Europe with potatoes , turkeys , tobacco , beans , and pumpkins .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Americanilor"" is translated as ""Americans,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""the Americans."" The reference translation is more accurate as it specifies the nationality of the recipients.
2. In the machine translation, ""suidae"" is used, which is a scientific term for a family of even-toed ungulates that includes pigs. In the reference translation, ""pigs"" is used, which is more understandable for a general audience.
3. In the machine translation, ""cartofi"" is translated as ""potatoes,"" ""curcani"" as ""turkeys,"" and ""dovleci"" as ""pumpkins,"" which are accurate translations. However, ""curcani"" could also be translated as ""geese"" or ""large birds,"" and ""dovleci"" could also be translated as ""gourds"" or ""squash."" The reference translation is more specific in identifying the types of animals and plants.
4. The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of ""și în schimb se întorceau în Europa"" as ""and instead returned to Europe."" A more accurate translation would be ""and in return returned to Europe with.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has some inaccuracies and lacks clarity in conveying the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and clear in its translation of the source text. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation.

 To evaluate the quality of the Romanian-English translation, I will compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify any differences.

Source: În 20 iunie 1982, Saddam Hussein a anunțat că trupele irakiene au început să se retragă din Iran, fiind pregătit să încheie un armistițiu.
Machine translation: On 20 June 1982, Saddam Hussein announced that Iraqi troops started to withdraw from Iran and were ready to conclude a truce.
Reference translation: On June 20 , 1982 , Saddam Hussein announced that Iraqi troops had begun withdrawing from Iran , preparing for an armistice .

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""started"" while the reference translation uses ""had begun."" Both convey the same meaning, but the reference translation is more formal.
2. The machine translation uses ""conclude a truce"" while the reference translation uses ""preparing for an armistice."" A truce is a temporary suspension of hostilities, while an armistice is a formal agreement to stop fighting. The reference translation is more accurate in this case.
3. The machine translation omits the comma after ""Iran"" in the sentence, which affects the sentence's readability. The reference translation includes the comma, making the sentence easier to understand.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has some minor differences compared to the reference translation. The main difference is the use of ""conclude a truce"" instead of ""preparing for an armistice."" The machine translation is still understandable, but the reference translation is more accurate and formal.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: O subtemă ce derivă de aici este relația complicată dintre tată și fiu.
Machine translation: One subtopic that derives from this is the complicated relationship between the father and the son.
Reference translation: A sub-theme that derives from this is the complicated relationship between father and son.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""One subtopic"" while the reference translation uses ""A sub-theme.""
- The machine translation uses ""the father and the son"" while the reference translation uses ""father and son.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the first point is minor, as both phrases convey the same meaning. The machine translation is slightly more formal, while the reference translation is more casual.
- The difference in the second point is also minor. The machine translation is more explicit in specifying the relationship between the two individuals, while the reference translation uses a more concise phrasing.

Step 4: Conclusion
Overall, the quality of the machine translation is high. The differences between the machine translation and the reference translation are minor and do not significantly impact the meaning or clarity of the translation. The machine translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source text and is very close to the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: În iunie, Vlad a adoptat tactică hărțuirii, așteptând zadarnic ajutorul promis din Ungaria.
Machine translation: In June, Vlad tactically adopted harassment, eagerly awaiting the promised aid from Hungary.
Reference translation: In June , Vlad adopted the tactic of harsassment , waiting in vain for the promised help from Hungary .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""eagerly awaiting"" while the reference translation uses ""waiting in vain.""
2. The machine translation uses ""tactically adopted harassment"" while the reference translation uses ""adopted the tactic of harsassment.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the phrase ""eagerly awaiting"" vs. ""waiting in vain"" does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both phrases convey the idea that Vlad was waiting for the promised aid, but the machine translation adds a slightly more positive connotation to the waiting process.
2. The difference in the phrase ""tactically adopted harassment"" vs. ""adopted the tactic of harsassment"" is more significant. The machine translation changes the meaning of the sentence by suggesting that Vlad tactically adopted harassment as a strategy, while the reference translation implies that Vlad adopted a tactic of harassment (possibly as a response to a situation). This difference in meaning could impact the overall understanding of the sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in meaning between the machine translation and the reference translation. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by more accurately conveying the meaning of the source text.

Machine translation: There are usually two or three contradictions organised in every Turkish edition.
Reference translation: Usually , two or three setbacks are organized in each edition of the Tour .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""Turkish edition"" while the source and reference translation mention ""Tour"" (referring to the Tour de France).
2. The machine translation uses the word ""contradictions"" while the source and reference translation use ""setbacks"" (referring to stages where the cyclists lose time).

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The mention of ""Turkish edition"" is a clear mistake, as the source and reference translation refer to the ""Tour de France."" This is a significant error in the translation.
2. The use of ""contradictions"" instead of ""setbacks"" is a less significant error, as ""contradictions"" could be understood as stages where the cyclists lose time. However, it is not the most accurate translation.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is poor due to the significant error in mentioning the ""Turkish edition"" instead of the ""Tour de France."" The less significant error in using ""contradictions"" instead of ""setbacks"" also contributes to the poor quality.

- The inclusion of ""Mr President"" is not relevant to the source and is an error.
- The translation of ""revărsările de primăvară"" as ""spring riots"" is not accurate, as ""revărsările"" means ""overflows"" and ""primăvară"" means ""spring."" This is a significant error in the translation.
- The translation of ""circa 2 săptămîni"" as ""almost 2 months"" is also a significant error, as ""circa 2 săptămîni"" means ""almost two weeks.""

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.
Based on the errors in the translation of key terms and the inclusion of irrelevant text, the overall quality of the machine translation is poor.

Machine translation: The aspirations of our enemy urge us to take a different path.
Reference translation: The aspirations of our nation urge us to follow another path.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- In the machine translation, ""enemy"" is used instead of ""nation"" in the reference translation.
- In the machine translation, ""take a different path"" is used instead of ""follow another path"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of ""enemy"" instead of ""nation"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the aspirations are coming from an enemy rather than the nation. This is a significant error in the translation.
- The use of ""take a different path"" instead of ""follow another path"" is a minor error, as both phrases convey a similar meaning. However, ""follow"" is more appropriate in this context, as it implies a more continuous action.

Reference translation: Life expectancy in Greece is 80.3 years , above the OECD average of 79.5 , and among the highest in the world .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""The life expectancy in Greece is 80,3 years"" while the reference translation uses ""Life expectancy in Greece is 80.3 years"". The machine translation has an extra comma and a space, making it less concise.
2. The machine translation uses ""above the OECD average of 79,5"" while the reference translation uses ""above the OECD average of 79.5"". The machine translation has an extra comma, which is a minor difference.
3. The machine translation uses ""and one of the largest in the world"" while the reference translation uses ""and among the highest in the world"". The machine translation uses ""largest"" instead of ""highest"", which changes the meaning slightly.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences in punctuation and word choice that make it less concise and slightly change the meaning. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Reference translation: And finally , the heavy or infantry tanks , which were heavily armored and generally very slow .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""fitted with"" while the reference translation uses ""heavily armored.""
- The machine translation omits the comma after ""And finally"" and before ""the heavy or infantry tanks.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in phrasing (""fitted with"" vs. ""heavily armored"") does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both phrases convey the idea that the tanks were well-protected.
- The omission of the comma in the machine translation slightly affects the readability of the sentence. The reference translation's use of the comma helps to separate the introductory phrase (""And finally"") from the main subject of the sentence (""the heavy or infantry tanks"").

Source: Jurnal oficial al Principatelor Unite Române”, nr.
Machine translation: This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Reference translation: Official Journal of the United Romanian Principalities ” , no .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation is significantly different from the reference translation. The machine translation talks about a regulation being binding and directly applicable, while the reference translation simply mentions the title of a publication, ""Official Journal of the United Romanian Principalities.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. It appears to be a case of a false positive, where the machine translation system has incorrectly translated the source text.

Step 4: Provide a corrected machine translation.

Corrected machine translation: ""Official Journal of the United Romanian Principalities"", no.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality of the corrected machine translation.

The corrected machine translation is now accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. The quality of the translation has been improved by addressing the initial inaccuracy.

Machine translation: The Labour Party's population declined during the recession started in 2008, with the loss of seats in the House of Commons.
Reference translation: The Labour Party 's popularity declined during the recession started in 2008 , with the loss of seats in the House of Commons .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""population"" while the reference translation uses ""popularity.""
2. The machine translation has a comma before ""with the loss of seats in the House of Commons,"" while the reference translation has a comma after ""recession started in 2008.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""population"" instead of ""popularity"" changes the meaning of the sentence. The source and reference translation are discussing the Labour Party's popularity, not its population. This is a significant error in the machine translation.
2. The placement of the comma in the machine translation is incorrect. The comma should be after ""recession started in 2008"" to match the reference translation. This is a minor error in the machine translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is poor due to the significant error in the use of ""population"" instead of ""popularity."" The minor error with the comma placement does not significantly impact the overall quality.

1. The difference in the phrase ""Midway battle"" vs. ""Battle of Midway"" is a minor one. Both phrases refer to the same event, but the reference translation follows the standard format of using ""Battle of"" before the name of the battle. This is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
2. The difference in the phrase ""the Pacific war"" vs. ""the Pacific War"" is also a minor one. Both phrases refer to the same conflict, but the reference translation uses a capital ""W"" for ""War,"" which is the standard format for proper nouns.

Reference translation: In January 1920 , despite his prestige , Clemenceau was defeated by Deschanel , who owed his dissatisfaction with his attitude to the Peace Conference .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""despite prestige"" while the reference translation uses ""despite his prestige.""
2. The machine translation uses ""due to dissatisfaction with the attitude to the Peace Conference"" while the reference translation uses ""who owed his dissatisfaction with his attitude to the Peace Conference.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation correctly captures the meaning of ""în ciuda prestigiului"" as ""despite prestige."" However, the reference translation is more specific by using ""his prestige,"" which makes it clear that the prestige belongs to Clemenceau.
2. The machine translation simplifies the sentence structure by removing the relative clause ""who owed his dissatisfaction with his attitude to the Peace Conference."" This simplification makes the sentence less clear and less accurate compared to the reference translation.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is mostly accurate but lacks the specificity and clarity of the reference translation. The differences in sentence structure and the omission of the relative clause make the machine translation less clear and less accurate.

Source: thumbleft150pxCupa de propagandă a lui [[Catilina pentru alegerile consulare din 62 î.Hr.
Machine translation: his propaganda copper thumbleft150pxCup [Catalyn for consular elections 62 r.
Reference translation: thumbleft150pxPropaganda cup of [ [ Catilina for consular elections in 62 î.Hr .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""propaganda"" is translated as ""propaganda,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""Propaganda."" The capitalization is different.
2. In the machine translation, ""copper thumbleft150pxCup"" is used, while in the reference translation, it is ""thumbleft150pxPropaganda cup."" The order of the words is different, and the machine translation includes an extra word ""copper.""
3. In the machine translation, ""Catalyn"" is used, while in the reference translation, it is ""Catilina."" The names are different.
4. In the machine translation, ""consular elections 62 r."" is used, while in the reference translation, it is ""consular elections in 62 î.Hr."" The abbreviation for ""before Christ"" (BC) is missing in the machine translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The capitalization of ""propaganda"" is a minor issue, and it does not significantly affect the overall quality of the translation.
2. The order of the words in the machine translation and the inclusion of the extra word ""copper"" make the sentence less clear and less accurate than the reference translation.
3. The name ""Catalyn"" is incorrect, as it should be ""Catilina."" This is a significant error in the translation.
4. The abbreviation for ""before Christ"" is missing in the machine translation, which makes the date less accurate.

Conclusion: The machine translation has several inaccuracies and errors compared to the reference translation. The overall quality of the machine translation is poor.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. ""The birds had quietly emerged"" vs. ""The birds had calmed down""
2. ""a molcom wind from Sori's Forest"" vs. ""a wind blowed softly from Păcuiul lui Soare""
3. ""when the month rose and sparks were found in the mouth"" vs. ""the moon was rising and trembling""
4. ""and the stars were twinkling in the lake"" vs. ""and the stars were twinkling in the lake""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. ""quietly emerged"" and ""calmed down"" are not the same, but both convey a sense of the birds becoming calm.
2. ""molcom wind"" is not the same as ""softly,"" but both describe a gentle wind. ""Sori's Forest"" is not the same as ""Păcuiul lui Soare,"" which is the correct name of the place in the source.
3. ""sparks were found in the mouth"" is a significant error, as it does not make sense in the context. The correct phrase is ""the moon was rising and trembling.""
4. Both translations are the same for this part, so there is no difference.

Overall, the machine translation has some errors and is not as accurate as the reference translation. The main issues are the incorrect translation of ""molcom wind"" and the nonsensical phrase ""sparks were found in the mouth."" The quality of the machine translation is not high, and it would be necessary to make some corrections to improve it.

Source: Podelele erau goale ori acoperite cu paie sau piei de animale.
Machine translation: The floor was empty or covered with straw or animal skins.
Reference translation: The floors were bare or covered with straw or animal skins.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""The floor"" while the reference translation uses ""The floors.""
- The machine translation uses ""was"" while the reference translation uses ""were.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the subject (""The floor"" vs. ""The floors"") is a minor issue, as both translations convey the same general meaning. However, the reference translation is more accurate, as it refers to multiple floors, not just one.
- The difference in the verb form (""was"" vs. ""were"") is also a minor issue. Both translations convey the same general meaning, but the reference translation is more grammatically accurate, as it agrees with the plural subject ""The floors.""

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it has minor inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The machine translation conveys the same general meaning, but the reference translation is more grammatically accurate and specific.

- ""prin mișcarea de bunăvoie"" vs ""by willingly moving""
- ""face"" vs ""make""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- ""dintâi"" is a Romanian word that means ""first"" or ""initially,"" while ""former"" is an English word that means ""previously existing"" or ""having been before."" The meaning of the two words is not the same, so the machine translation is incorrect here.
- ""trupul una cu mintea"" is a Romanian phrase that means ""the body one with the mind,"" while ""the body one with the mind"" is a correct English translation of this phrase. The machine translation is correct in this case.
- ""prin mișcarea de bunăvoie"" is a Romanian phrase that means ""by moving voluntarily,"" while ""by willingly moving"" is a correct English translation of this phrase. The machine translation is correct in this case.
- ""face"" is a Romanian verb that means ""to make"" or ""to do,"" while ""make"" is a correct English translation of this verb. The machine translation is correct in this case.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly correct, but there is one significant error in the translation of the word ""dintâi."" The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by correcting this error.

Source: Fruntașii români au aflat despre tratativele dintre austrieci și unguri în privința Banatului, ca regiunea să fie trecută sub administrare maghiară.
Machine translation: The Romanian leaves learnt about the talks between Austria and Hungarians with regard to the Bank, the region being put under Hungarian administration.
Reference translation: The Romanian leaders found out about the negociations between Austrians and Hungarians with regard to the Banat , so that the region would be passed under Hungarian administration .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""The Romanian leaves"" vs. ""The Romanian leaders""
2. ""the Bank"" vs. ""the Banat""
3. ""the region being put under Hungarian administration"" vs. ""so that the region would be passed under Hungarian administration""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. ""The Romanian leaves"" should be ""The Romanian leaders"" as the source is talking about the Romanian leaders, not the leaves.
2. ""the Bank"" should be ""the Banat"" as the source is talking about the Banat region, not a bank.
3. ""the region being put under Hungarian administration"" is a more passive phrasing compared to ""so that the region would be passed under Hungarian administration"", which is more active and conveys the intention behind the negotiation.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation has several inaccuracies and does not fully capture the meaning of the source text. The quality of the machine translation is poor.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: The Sudan bury, Bilerica, Reading, Waburn and other fairs led to the Concord.
Reference translation: Farmers in Sudbury , Bilerica , Reading , Waburn and other fairs drove to Concord .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- ""The Sudan bury"" in the machine translation is different from ""Farmers in Sudbury"" in the reference translation.
- ""led to the Concord"" in the machine translation is different from ""drove to Concord"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- ""The Sudan bury"" is a nonsensical phrase, as ""Sudan"" is a country and not relevant to the context, and ""bury"" is not a verb that fits the context. The correct translation should be ""Farmers in Sudbury,"" which is present in the reference translation.
- ""led to the Concord"" is a grammatically correct phrase, but it does not convey the same meaning as ""drove to Concord."" The verb ""led"" implies that the fairs themselves led to Concord, while ""drove"" implies that the farmers drove to Concord. The correct translation should be ""drove to Concord,"" which is present in the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has some significant errors in comparison to the reference translation. The incorrect use of ""The Sudan bury"" and ""led to the Concord"" result in a translation that does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is low.

Machine translation: Because of poverty, Hermann Kafka had, since fourteen years, had to abandon studies and work as outpatient merchant.
Reference translation: Due to poverty , Hermann Kafka was forced to drop out of school at the age of fourteen and work as a street vendor .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""Because of poverty"" vs. ""Due to poverty"": These phrases have the same meaning, so this difference is not significant.
2. ""Hermann Kafka had, since fourteen years"" vs. ""Hermann Kafka was forced to drop out of school at the age of fourteen"": The machine translation uses a more complex and less clear phrasing to convey the same information as the reference translation.
3. ""work as outpatient merchant"" vs. ""work as a street vendor"": These phrases have different meanings. An outpatient merchant is someone who sells goods while traveling, while a street vendor is someone who sells goods from a fixed location on the street.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation is of moderate quality. It captures the general meaning of the source text but uses less clear and less accurate phrasing in some parts. The main issue is the difference in meaning between ""outpatient merchant"" and ""street vendor."" This difference could potentially lead to confusion for the reader.

Overall, the machine translation is understandable but not as clear or accurate as the reference translation.

Reference translation: Later , he would add important parts of Asia Minor to the kingdom .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation does not mention ""he"" and ""the kingdom,"" which are present in the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""it"" instead of ""he,"" which changes the subject of the sentence.
- The machine translation uses ""major parts"" instead of ""important parts,"" which changes the description of the parts being added.
- The machine translation uses ""Asia Mica"" instead of ""Asia Minor,"" which is a different name for the same region.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.
- The omission of ""he"" and ""the kingdom"" changes the subject and context of the sentence, making the machine translation less accurate than the reference translation.
- The use of ""it"" instead of ""he"" further confuses the subject and context of the sentence.
- The change in the description of the parts being added (""major"" vs. ""important"") also reduces the accuracy of the machine translation.
- The use of ""Asia Mica"" instead of ""Asia Minor"" is a minor issue, as both names refer to the same region, but it is still a difference between the machine and reference translations.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation due to the omission of key information, changes in the subject and context, and a slight difference in the description of the parts being added.

Machine translation: The 1920s feed had a noisy and furthest daily life, which only specified the urban environment and concentrated 80% of the population.
Reference translation: The stormy ' 20s had a noisy and stormy daily life , specific only to the urban environment , being concentrated 80 % of the population .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""The 1920s feed had a noisy and furthest daily life"" vs. ""The stormy ' 20s had a noisy and stormy daily life"" - The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Furtunoșii"" as ""feed"" and omits the word ""stormy"" which is present in the reference translation.
2. ""which only specified the urban environment"" vs. ""specific only to the urban environment"" - The machine translation uses ""specified"" while the reference translation uses ""specific,"" which is more accurate in this context.
3. ""concentrated 80% of the population"" vs. ""being concentrated 80 % of the population"" - The machine translation does not correctly convey the meaning of the original text, which is that the noisy and stormy daily life is concentrated in the urban environment.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has several inaccuracies and does not fully convey the meaning of the original text. The translation of ""Furtunoșii"" as ""feed"" is incorrect, and the omission of the word ""stormy"" changes the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, the machine translation does not accurately convey the idea that the noisy and stormy daily life is concentrated in the urban environment.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original text and contains several inaccuracies.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Cu toate că populația locală era dedicată trup și suflet agriculturii,
Machine translation: Although the local population was dedicated to agriculture,
Reference translation: Although the local population was dedicated body and soul to agriculture ,

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""body and soul"" which is present in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the differences on the quality of the translation.
- The phrase ""body and soul"" is an idiomatic expression in English, which means to be completely committed to something. By including this phrase, the reference translation conveys the full extent of the local population's dedication to agriculture.
- The machine translation's omission of this phrase results in a less accurate and less idiomatic translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the idiomatic expression ""body and soul"" which is present in the reference translation. This omission slightly reduces the quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by including the idiomatic expression ""body and soul"" to better match the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. ""picture"" vs. ""painting"": The machine translation uses the word ""picture"" while the reference translation uses the word ""painting."" However, both words can be used to describe a visual artwork, so this difference is not significant in terms of quality.

2. ""Mihai Viteaself"" vs. ""Mihai Viteazul"": The machine translation incorrectly translates the name ""Mihai Viteazul"" as ""Mihai Viteaself."" This is a significant error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence and introduces an incorrect name.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has one significant error (the incorrect translation of the name ""Mihai Viteazul"") and one minor error (using ""picture"" instead of ""painting""). The overall quality of the machine translation is low due to the significant error, which affects the meaning of the sentence.

Machine translation: This follows the tourism mark with yellow triangle.
Reference translation: From here follows the tourist marking with yellow triangle.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""This follows"" while the reference translation uses ""From here follows.""
- The machine translation uses ""tourism mark"" while the reference translation uses ""tourist marking.""

Machine translation: The idea of the exceptional nature of its own nation, the idea of the historical mission, arises at the French side.
Reference translation: The French have the idea of the exceptional character of their own nation, the idea of the historical mission.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""arises at the French side"" while the reference translation uses ""The French have.""
2. The machine translation uses ""the idea of the exceptional nature"" while the reference translation uses ""the idea of the exceptional character.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The phrase ""arises at the French side"" is less clear and less concise than ""The French have."" It is more difficult to understand the meaning of the machine translation in this regard.
2. The phrase ""the idea of the exceptional nature"" is less accurate than ""the idea of the exceptional character."" The word ""nature"" does not convey the same meaning as ""character"" in this context.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation due to the less clear and less concise phrasing and the less accurate choice of words. The reference translation is more accurate and easier to understand.

Machine translation: The camp, the only furniture left out of the old church, is in Saint Cruce's trap.
Reference translation: The tabernacle , the only furniture left out of the old church , is in Saint Cross chappel .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- ""camp"" vs ""tabernacle""
- ""the only furniture left out of the old church"" (same in both)
- ""is in Saint Cruce's trap"" vs ""is in Saint Cross chappel""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- ""camp"" is not the correct translation for ""tabernacle"" in this context. A tabernacle is a small container or box, usually made of metal or wood, in which the consecrated Eucharistic bread (the Body of Christ) is kept in a Catholic church. A camp is a temporary settlement, usually for leisure or military purposes.
- ""trap"" is not the correct translation for ""chappel"" (chapel). A trap is a device used to catch animals or insects, while a chapel is a small place of worship, usually found within a larger building or separate from it.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has two major errors: it incorrectly translates ""tabernacle"" as ""camp"" and ""chappel"" as ""trap."" These errors significantly change the meaning of the sentence and make the translation inaccurate.

Source: Această perspectivă, în fond idealizată, asupra portretului, revendică un limbaj emfatic, respectiv o retorică ceremonioasă.
Machine translation: This perspective, ultimately idealised, on the portrait, is claiming an emphatic language, which is ceremonious rhetoric.
Reference translation: This perspective , basically idealized , on the portrait , claims an emphatic language , respectively a ceremonial rhetoric .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""ultimately idealised"" while the reference translation uses ""basically idealized.""
2. The machine translation uses ""is claiming"" while the reference translation uses ""claims.""
3. The machine translation uses ""which is ceremonious rhetoric"" while the reference translation uses ""an emphatic language , respectively a ceremonial rhetoric.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the adverb ""ultimately"" vs. ""basically"" changes the emphasis of the sentence but does not significantly alter the meaning. Both adverbs indicate that the idealization is a central aspect of the perspective.
2. The difference between ""is claiming"" and ""claims"" is minor. Both phrases convey the same idea that the perspective asserts something.
3. The machine translation combines ""an emphatic language"" and ""ceremonious rhetoric"" into one phrase, while the reference translation separates them with a comma. This change slightly alters the meaning, as it implies that the machine translation views the emphatic language and ceremonious rhetoric as a single concept, while the reference translation treats them as two separate elements.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with only minor differences in word choice and phrasing. The overall meaning is preserved, but the slight changes in emphasis and structure may affect the reader's understanding.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Totuși poezia pare să nu aducă niciun beneficiu pe termen scurt.
Machine translation: However, this does not seem to bring any short-term benefits.
Reference translation: However , poetry does not seem to bring any short-term benefits .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""this"" while the reference translation uses ""poetry"".
- The machine translation has a comma after ""However"" while the reference translation does not.

Step 3: Analyze the differences to evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of ""this"" instead of ""poetry"" in the machine translation is a minor error, as ""this"" still refers to the subject of the sentence. However, it is less specific than the reference translation.
- The comma after ""However"" in the machine translation is not necessary and is not present in the reference translation. This is a minor stylistic error that does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. However, there are minor differences in word choice and punctuation that make the machine translation slightly less specific and stylistically different from the reference translation. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement.

 The machine translation provided is not a translation of the source text. Instead, it is a citation of a European Court of Justice case, which is unrelated to the source text. The source text is about the number of passengers served by airports in the United Kingdom in 2017, while the machine translation is about a legal case involving a German transportation company and a regional government in Germany.

To evaluate the quality of a Romanian-English translation, we need to compare the machine translation to the reference translation, which accurately conveys the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is: ""In 2017, the airports in the United Kingdom served a total of 287.5 million passengers.""

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways:

1. The machine translation is not a translation of the source text but rather a citation of a legal case.
2. The machine translation does not mention the number of passengers served by airports in the United Kingdom in 2017.
3. The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text.

Based on these differences, the quality of the machine translation is poor, as it does not accurately translate the source text into English.

3. The machine translation uses ""place I"" while the reference translation uses ""the first place.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""atypical"" instead of ""satirical"" changes the meaning slightly, as ""atypical"" means not conforming to a type or standard, while ""satirical"" means using humor to criticize or expose foolishness. This difference in meaning could affect the overall understanding of the text.
2. The use of ""represented"" instead of ""performed"" changes the meaning as well, as ""represented"" implies a more symbolic or abstract presentation, while ""performed"" implies a more concrete and direct presentation. This difference in meaning could also affect the overall understanding of the text.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the verb choice (""attentive"" vs. ""attracted the attention"") slightly changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Attentive"" implies that the business was actively paying attention to the political scene, while ""attracted the attention"" implies that the business itself was the focus of the political scene's attention.
- The difference in the prepositional phrase (""to the political scene"" vs. ""of the political scene"") also changes the meaning of the sentence. ""To the political scene"" implies that the business was paying attention to the political scene in general, while ""of the political scene"" implies that the business was a part of the political scene.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not of high quality because it changes the meaning of the source text by altering the verb choice and prepositional phrase. The reference translation more accurately captures the meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Rezoluția ONU a cerut Marii Britanii să își evacueze un port și suficient spațiu pentru o imigrație substanțială a evreilor, până în februarie 1948.
Machine translation: The UN resolution called on Britain to evacuate a port and sufficient space for substantial immigration of Jews until February 1948.
Reference translation: The UN resolution called on Britain to evacuate a port and enough space for substantial immigration of Jews by February 1948.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""sufficient space"" while the reference translation uses ""enough space.""
2. The machine translation uses ""until February 1948"" while the reference translation uses ""by February 1948.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in word choice between ""sufficient space"" and ""enough space"" does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both phrases convey the same idea that a certain amount of space is needed for the immigration of Jews.
2. The difference in the use of ""until"" and ""by"" is more significant. ""Until"" implies that the action must be completed before the specified date, while ""by"" implies that the action should be completed no later than the specified date. In this context, the use of ""by"" is more appropriate, as it is common to use ""by"" when referring to deadlines or time constraints.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in word choice and the use of ""until"" vs. ""by"" that impact the meaning of the sentence. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using ""enough space"" and ""by"" to more accurately convey the meaning of the source text.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Dictatura ar fi astfel doar un mijloc de a reveni la stabilitatea și normalitatea care sunt indispensabile pentru aplicarea și eficiența dreptului.
Machine translation: This would merely be a means of returning to stability and normality that are indispensable for the application and effectiveness of the law.
Reference translation: Dictatorship would thus be only a means of returning to the stability and normalcy that are indispensable for the application and effectiveness of the law.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""This"" while the reference translation uses ""Dictatorship"".
2. The machine translation uses ""normality"" while the reference translation uses ""normalcy"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The machine translation starts with ""This would merely be"" while the reference translation starts with ""Dictatorship would thus be only"". The machine translation omits the word ""Dictatorship"" and the phrase ""thus be only"", which changes the meaning slightly. The reference translation emphasizes that the dictatorship is only a means to an end, while the machine translation simply states that it is a means without emphasizing the ""only"" aspect.

2. The machine translation uses ""normality"" while the reference translation uses ""normalcy"". These words are synonyms and can be used interchangeably. The choice between ""normality"" and ""normalcy"" does not significantly affect the quality of the translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it omits the word ""Dictatorship"" and the phrase ""thus be only"" at the beginning of the sentence, which changes the meaning slightly. The choice between ""normality"" and ""normalcy"" does not significantly affect the quality of the translation. Overall, the machine translation is of good quality, but it could be improved by including the omitted words and phrases from the reference translation.

- The machine translation does not use a comma to separate the adjectives ""Hungarian,"" ""Austrian,"" and ""Turkish.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the subject (""The continental piece"" vs. ""Continental cuisine"") changes the meaning of the sentence. ""The continental piece"" could refer to a specific dish or item, while ""Continental cuisine"" refers to the broader category of cuisine.
- The difference in the use of ""styles"" vs. ""culinary styles"" also changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Styles"" could refer to any type of style, while ""culinary styles"" specifically refers to styles related to cooking and food.
- The difference in the use of a comma to separate the adjectives makes the machine translation less clear and could cause confusion for the reader.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is low because it changes the meaning of the source text and is less clear than the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Celelalte consilii regionale sunt alese de consiliile locale, fiecare comună trimițând reprezentanți proporțional cu populația.
Machine translation: The other regional councils shall be chosen by the local councils, each joint by sending representatives proportional to the population.
Reference translation: Other regional councils are elected by municipal councils , each municipality sending representatives in proportion to its population .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""The other regional councils shall be chosen by the local councils"" vs. ""Other regional councils are elected by municipal councils""
2. ""each joint by sending representatives"" vs. ""each municipality sending representatives""
3. ""proportional to the population"" is the same in both translations.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""shall be chosen"" while the reference translation uses ""are elected."" Both phrases convey the same meaning, but ""are elected"" is more common in English.
2. The machine translation uses ""each joint by sending representatives"" which is not clear and seems to be a typo. The correct phrase should be ""each municipality sending representatives,"" as seen in the reference translation.
3. The phrase ""proportional to the population"" is correctly translated in both the machine and reference translations.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has some issues with word choice and clarity, but the overall meaning is still conveyed. The reference translation is clearer and more accurate in terms of word choice. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is moderate.

2. The machine translation uses ""overwhelmingly overwhelmed"" while the reference translation uses ""outnumbered"".
3. The machine translation uses ""has been evacuated"" while the reference translation uses ""was evacuated"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The typo in the machine translation is a minor error that does not affect the overall meaning.
2. The use of ""overwhelmingly overwhelmed"" is a less accurate translation of ""copleșită numeric"", as it implies that the British Garnizoana was overwhelmed by its own actions, rather than by a larger force. The reference translation's use of ""outnumbered"" more accurately conveys the meaning of the source.
3. The use of ""has been evacuated"" in the machine translation is grammatically correct but less accurate than the reference translation's use of ""was evacuated"". The past perfect tense in the reference translation better conveys the sequence of events, as the evacuation occurred after the two weeks of fighting had already taken place.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate but contains some minor errors and less accurate word choices.

815	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Romanian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Muzeul de artă bisericească veche din subsolul Catedralei Mitropolitane.
Machine translation: The old church of art at the subsoil of Mitropolitan Catedral.
Reference translation: The museum of old church art in the basement of Metropolitan Cathedral.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- ""The old church of art"" vs. ""The museum of old church art"": The machine translation refers to the location as an ""old church of art,"" while the reference translation correctly identifies it as a ""museum.""
- ""at the subsoil"" vs. ""in the basement"": The machine translation uses ""at the subsoil,"" which is a less common and less accurate way to describe the location. The reference translation uses ""in the basement,"" which is more accurate and easier to understand.
- ""Mitropolitan Catedral"" vs. ""Metropolitan Cathedral"": The machine translation incorrectly combines the words ""Mitropolitan"" and ""Catedral,"" while the reference translation correctly translates it as ""Metropolitan Cathedral.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.
The machine translation has several inaccuracies and is less clear than the reference translation. It incorrectly describes the location as an ""old church of art"" instead of a ""museum"" and uses less accurate phrasing to describe the location. Additionally, it incorrectly translates ""Mitropolitan Catedral"" as ""Mitropolitan Catedral"" instead of ""Metropolitan Cathedral.""

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor, as it contains inaccuracies and is less clear than the reference translation.

816	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Romanian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: gard din plăci prefabricate și din sârmă plasă galvanizată și împrejmuirea
Machine translation: Prefabricated buildings, and wire and fencing, of galvanised wire and fencing
Reference translation: fence of prefabricated boards and galvanized mesh wire and fencing

Step 2: Identify the key elements in the source text.
- gard (fence)
- plăci prefabricate (prefabricated boards)
- sârmă plasă galvanizată (galvanized mesh wire)
- împrejmuirea (fencing)

Step 3: Compare the key elements in the machine translation with those in the reference translation.

In the machine translation:
- ""Prefabricated buildings"" is not present in the source text.
- ""sârmă plasă galvanizată"" is translated as ""galvanised wire"" instead of ""galvanized mesh wire.""
- ""împrejmuirea"" is translated as ""fencing"" instead of ""fence.""

In the reference translation:
- ""Prefabricated boards"" corresponds to ""plăci prefabricate"" in the source text.
- ""galvanized mesh wire"" corresponds to ""sârmă plasă galvanizată"" in the source text.
- ""fence"" corresponds to ""gard"" in the source text.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the comparison.

The machine translation is not accurate because it includes elements that are not present in the source text (prefabricated buildings) and omits or misinterprets other key elements (galvanized mesh wire and fence). The reference translation is more accurate, as it correctly interprets the key elements in the source text.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor compared to the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Bazele legale pentru relațiile UE cu Rusia le constituie Acordul de Parteneriat și Cooperare cu Rusia, intrat în vigoare în 1997, înnoit în mai 2003.
Machine translation: The legal bases for EU relations with Russia are the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia, entered into force in 1997, renewed in May 2003.
Reference translation: The legal basis for the EU 's relations with Russia is the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia , which entered into force in 1997 and was renewed in May 2003 .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""legal bases"" while the reference translation uses ""legal basis."" The reference translation is more accurate as the source mentions ""Bazele legale"" which translates to ""legal bases"" in plural.
2. The machine translation uses ""entered into force"" while the reference translation uses ""entered into force."" Both are correct translations of ""intrat în vigoare.""
3. The machine translation uses ""renewed"" while the reference translation uses ""was renewed."" The reference translation is more accurate as it uses the passive voice, which is more common in legal translations.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor differences compared to the reference translation. The main difference is the use of ""legal bases"" instead of ""legal basis"" and the use of ""renewed"" instead of ""was renewed."" These differences do not significantly impact the overall meaning of the translation, but they do make it slightly less accurate than the reference translation.

Reference translation: The latter , however , spoke with the vice-president of the Senate , the Alsatian , who was in turn touched by doubts .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation has ""The latter, however, spoke to the Vice-President of the Senate, Alsacian, in turn, touched on doubts.""
2. The reference translation has ""The latter , however , spoke with the vice-president of the Senate , the Alsatian , who was in turn touched by doubts.""

Differences:
- The machine translation uses ""to"" while the reference translation uses ""with"" for the action of speaking.
- The machine translation has ""in turn, touched on doubts"" while the reference translation has ""who was in turn touched by doubts.""

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate. It has captured the general meaning of the source text, but there are some differences in the choice of words and sentence structure.

- The use of ""to"" instead of ""with"" for the action of speaking changes the meaning slightly.
- The phrase ""in turn, touched on doubts"" is less clear than the reference translation's ""who was in turn touched by doubts.""

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The quality of the machine translation is moderate. It conveys the general meaning of the source text but has some inaccuracies in the choice of words and sentence structure. The translation could be improved by using ""with"" instead of ""to"" and by using a clearer phrase to describe the situation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Coloniile erau conduse de Consiliul Indiilor din Spania pentru a se asigura cǎ bǎștinașii nu vor fi supuși unor tratamente rele.
Machine translation: The colonies were run by the Spanish Council of India in order to ensure that dogs would not be treated badly.
Reference translation: The colonies were run by the Spanish Council of the Indies to ensure that the natives would not be subjected to ill-treatment.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""Spanish Council of India"" vs. Reference translation: ""Spanish Council of the Indies""
- Machine translation: ""dogs"" vs. Reference translation: ""natives""
- Machine translation: ""treated badly"" vs. Reference translation: ""subjected to ill-treatment""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- ""Spanish Council of India"" vs. ""Spanish Council of the Indies"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Indiilor"" as ""India"" instead of ""the Indies."" This is a significant error as it changes the meaning of the phrase.
- ""dogs"" vs. ""natives"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""bǎștinașii"" as ""dogs"" instead of ""natives."" This is a significant error as it changes the subject of the sentence.
- ""treated badly"" vs. ""subjected to ill-treatment"": The machine translation uses ""treated badly"" which is a less formal and less accurate translation of ""supuși unor tratamente rele"" compared to the reference translation's ""subjected to ill-treatment.""

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation has several significant errors compared to the reference translation. The translation of ""Indiilor"" as ""India"" instead of ""the Indies"" changes the meaning of the phrase. The translation of ""bǎștinașii"" as ""dogs"" instead of ""natives"" changes the subject of the sentence. Finally, the use of ""treated badly"" instead of a more accurate and formal translation like ""subjected to ill-treatment"" detracts from the overall quality of the translation.

Machine translation: Nicholas Buda, Late eavesdropping, a poem of correspondence with the Dumitru poet Cerna.
Reference translation: Nicholas Buda , The Twilight of the Late Whispers , a poem of correspondence with the poet Dumitru Cerna .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Late eavesdropping"" while the reference translation uses ""The Twilight of the Late Whispers.""
2. The machine translation refers to Dumitru as ""the Dumitru poet Cerna,"" while the reference translation simply refers to him as ""the poet Dumitru Cerna.""

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation.

1. The title translation: ""Late eavesdropping"" is a less accurate translation of ""Amurgul șoaptelor târzii"" compared to ""The Twilight of the Late Whispers."" The machine translation captures the general idea of the title but loses some of the nuance and poetic quality present in the reference translation.
2. The name translation: The machine translation's reference to Dumitru as ""the Dumitru poet Cerna"" is less accurate than the reference translation's ""the poet Dumitru Cerna."" The machine translation adds unnecessary information and creates a less natural phrasing.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate but lacks the poetic quality and nuance present in the reference translation. The differences in the title and name translations contribute to the overall lower quality of the machine translation compared to the reference translation.

Reference translation: The old corporate privileges of the church were abolished , such as the right to decide how much tax to pay .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of a comma in the reference translation. The machine translation uses ""so"" to connect the two ideas, while the reference translation uses a comma to separate the two ideas.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the use of ""so"" instead of a comma to connect the two ideas makes the sentence structure slightly less clear than the reference translation. The reference translation's use of a comma creates a clearer distinction between the abolished corporate privileges and the specific example of the right to decide how much tax to pay.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using a comma instead of ""so"" to connect the two ideas. This would make the sentence structure more similar to the reference translation and improve the clarity of the translation.

852	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Romanian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: stangaminiaturaAutoservirea este o modalitate de a livra bunuri care presupune costuri reduse
Machine translation: stangaminiaturaAutoservirea is a cost-effective way of delivering low-cost goods.
Reference translation: stangaminiaturaSelf-service is a way to deliver goods that involve low costs

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation includes the term ""cost-effective,"" while the reference translation does not.
2. The machine translation translates ""Autoservirea"" as ""Autoservirea is,"" while the reference translation translates it as ""Self-service is.""
3. The machine translation translates ""este o modalitate de a livra bunuri care presupune costuri reduse"" as ""a way of delivering low-cost goods,"" while the reference translation translates it as ""a way to deliver goods that involve low costs.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The inclusion of ""cost-effective"" in the machine translation adds an extra layer of meaning that is not present in the reference translation. This could be seen as a positive or negative aspect, depending on the context and the intended meaning.
2. The translation of ""Autoservirea"" as ""Autoservirea is"" in the machine translation is incorrect. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""Self-service is,"" which is a more accurate representation of the original source.
3. The translation of ""este o modalitate de a livra bunuri care presupune costuri reduse"" in the machine translation is slightly less accurate than the reference translation. The machine translation focuses on the ""low-cost goods"" aspect, while the reference translation emphasizes the ""goods that involve low costs"" aspect.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is moderate. It captures the general meaning of the source text but has some inaccuracies and additional elements that are not present in the reference translation.

Source: Ei au refuzat să se supună ordinului militar implicit.
Machine translation: They refused to submit to the default military order.
Reference translation: They refused to obey the implicit military order.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""submit to the default military order"" while the reference translation uses ""obey the implicit military order.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is not entirely accurate. The word ""default"" in the machine translation is not the best choice, as it implies that the military order is not valid or has been disregarded. The reference translation uses ""implicit,"" which is more accurate, as it means that the order is not explicitly stated but is understood.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The quality of the machine translation is not high. It is not a complete translation of the source text, and the choice of words is not accurate. The machine translation does convey the general meaning of the source text, but it is not as clear or precise as the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Cea mai întinsă zonă de pădure din municipiul Târgu Mureș se află la cea mai înaltă cotă a orașului, pe Platoul Cornești.
Machine translation: The largest forest area in the municipality of Târgu Mureș accounts for the city's highest share on the Cornești Platoul.
Reference translation: The largest forest area in Târgu Mureș is located at the highest point of the city , on the Cornești Plateau .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""accounts for the city's highest share"" while the reference translation uses ""is located at the highest point of the city"".
2. The machine translation uses ""on the Cornești Platoul"" while the reference translation uses ""on the Cornești Plateau"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The phrase ""accounts for the city's highest share"" is not as clear as ""is located at the highest point of the city"". The reference translation directly states the location of the forest area, while the machine translation implies a comparison or proportion between the forest area and the city's highest point.
2. The use of ""Platoul"" (plateau) in the machine translation is incorrect, as the correct term is ""Plateau"" (with a capital P). This is a minor error, but it affects the accuracy of the translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The phrase ""accounts for the city's highest share"" is less clear than ""is located at the highest point of the city"", and the incorrect use of ""Platoul"" instead of ""Plateau"" also affects the quality. The machine translation is not completely incorrect, but it is less clear and less accurate than the reference translation.
