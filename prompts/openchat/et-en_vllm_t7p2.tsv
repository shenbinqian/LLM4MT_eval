0	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Neid viimaseid asju ei pruugi mõistuspärane toimija soovida, õieti ei tohi soovida, selleks et olla mõistuspärane soovija.
Machine translation: These last things may not be wanted by a rational player, or perhaps not wanted, in order to be a rational wish.
Reference translation: These last things may not be wanted by a rational actor , or more accurately , should not be wanted , in order to be a rational wish-maker .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""viimaseid asju"" (last things) is translated correctly in both machine and reference translations.
2. ""pruugi mõistuspärane toimija"" (not compelled by a rational actor) is translated as ""rational player"" in the machine translation and ""rational actor"" in the reference translation. The meaning is slightly different, but both translations convey the idea of a person acting rationally.
3. ""õieti ei tohi soovida"" (or perhaps not wanted) is translated correctly in both machine and reference translations.
4. ""selleks et olla mõistuspärane soovija"" (in order to be a rational wish-maker) is translated as ""in order to be a rational wish"" in the machine translation. The reference translation correctly captures the idea of being a ""rational wish-maker.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it misses the nuance of ""rational wish-maker"" in the source text. The reference translation captures this nuance better. Overall, the machine translation is of good quality, but it could be improved by capturing the nuance of ""rational wish-maker.""
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

1	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Tuleb otsustada, kui suur erinevus on selle vahel, mida ta tegi, ja tegude vahel, mis näitavad meile mõrva tõsidust.
Machine translation: It is important to decide what a difference there is between what he has done and the actions that show us the gravity of the murder.
Reference translation: It is important to decide how big a difference there is between what he has done and the actions that show us the gravity of the murder.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

In the machine translation, the phrase ""what a difference there is"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""how big a difference there is.""

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the differences on the overall meaning and quality of the translation.

The difference between ""what a difference there is"" and ""how big a difference there is"" is subtle. Both phrases convey the idea that there is a difference between two things being compared. However, ""how big a difference there is"" emphasizes the size or extent of the difference, while ""what a difference there is"" simply acknowledges the existence of a difference without emphasizing its size.

In the context of the source text, the emphasis on the size or extent of the difference is more appropriate, as it relates to the severity of the murder. The machine translation's choice of words slightly alters the meaning and emphasis of the original text.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but there is a minor issue with the choice of words in the phrase ""what a difference there is."" The reference translation, ""how big a difference there is,"" would be a more accurate and appropriate translation of the source text.

Final evaluation: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there is a minor issue with the choice of words in the phrase ""what a difference there is."" The reference translation, ""how big a difference there is,"" would be a more accurate and appropriate translation of the source text.

2	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Esimesel päeval kohtus ta Kiievis Ukraina peaministri Viktor Janukovõtšiga ja presidendi Viktor Juštšenkoga.
Machine translation: On the first day in Kiev, he met Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and President Viktor Yushchenko.
Reference translation: On the first day , he met in Kiev with Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and President Viktor Yushchenko .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation has a comma after ""On the first day"" while the reference translation has a space.
2. The machine translation has ""in Kiev"" while the reference translation has ""in Kiev with.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The comma usage in the machine translation is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
2. The machine translation omits the word ""with"" before ""Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and President Viktor Yushchenko,"" which makes the sentence slightly less clear than the reference translation.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is mostly accurate and captures the main ideas of the source text. However, it has a minor issue with the omission of the word ""with"" and a slight difference in punctuation. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by addressing these minor issues.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Eesti diplomaatilist esindust ega aukonsulit riigis ei ole.
Machine translation: There is no Estonian diplomatic representation or honorary consul in the country.
Reference translation: There is no Estonian diplomatic mission or honorary consul in the country.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation and reference translation are almost identical, with only one difference:

Machine translation: ""There is no Estonian diplomatic representation or honorary consul in the country.""
Reference translation: ""There is no Estonian diplomatic mission or honorary consul in the country.""

The difference lies in the word ""mission"" in the reference translation, while the machine translation uses ""representation.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

In this case, the machine translation is very close to the reference translation, with only a slight difference in the choice of words. Both translations convey the same meaning, and the difference is minor.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is high, as it accurately translates the source text and is very close to the reference translation. The difference in word choice does not significantly impact the overall meaning or quality of the translation.

Machine translation: Some Islamic chemists already knew that some metals would become more difficult when they bought.
Reference translation: Some Islamic chemists already knew that some metals would become heavier when they rust.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. Machine translation: ""more difficult"" vs. Reference translation: ""heavier""
2. Machine translation: ""when they bought"" vs. Reference translation: ""when they rust""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference between ""more difficult"" and ""heavier"" is significant. The source text and reference translation both mention the metals becoming ""heavier,"" while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""more difficult."" This error changes the meaning of the sentence and is a major issue in the quality of the translation.
2. The difference between ""when they bought"" and ""when they rust"" is also significant. The source text and reference translation both mention the metals becoming heavier ""when they rust,"" while the machine translation incorrectly translates this as ""when they bought."" This error changes the context of the sentence and is another major issue in the quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation has two major issues that change the meaning and context of the original source text. The quality of the Estonian-English translation is poor due to these errors.

Machine translation: According to the chronics of Renner, 'kings passed on to the Estonians and restricted Tallinn to ten thousand men'.
Reference translation: According to the chronicle of Renner , the kings then "" continued with the Estonians and besieged Tallinn with ten thousand men "" .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""chronics"" while the reference translation uses ""chronicle"". Both are correct, but ""chronicle"" is more accurate in this context.
2. The machine translation says ""kings passed on to the Estonians"" while the reference translation says ""kings continued with the Estonians"". The machine translation is less clear and may be interpreted as the kings moving to the Estonians, while the reference translation implies the kings continued their actions with the Estonians.
3. The machine translation says ""restricted Tallinn to ten thousand men"" while the reference translation says ""besieged Tallinn with ten thousand men"". The machine translation implies that the kings limited the number of people in Tallinn, while the reference translation correctly states that the kings surrounded Tallinn with an army of ten thousand men.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It has some errors in word choice and interpretation of the source text. The reference translation is clearer and more accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text.

Machine translation: The Popperi démarches criterion between science and pseudo-science stipulated that theory must be homogenised.
Reference translation: Popper 's demarcation criterion between science and pseudo-science stipulated that theory must be falsified .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Popperi démarches criterion"" while the reference translation uses ""Popper 's demarcation criterion"".
2. The machine translation uses ""homogenised"" while the reference translation uses ""falsified"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the name of the criterion is a minor error. It is likely that the machine translation is using the incorrect form of the word ""demarcation"" in Estonian, which should be ""demarkatsioonikriteerium"".
2. The difference in the word ""homogenised"" and ""falsified"" is more significant. The machine translation uses ""homogenised"" which means to make uniform or consistent, while the reference translation uses ""falsified"" which means to show that a theory is false. This is a major error as it changes the meaning of the sentence.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the significant error in the translation of the word ""homogenised"" to ""falsified"". The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text.

1. The use of a comma in the machine translation is not incorrect, but it may affect the flow of the sentence. The reference translation's flow is more natural.
2. The machine translation's phrasing ""some places are gathering sludge"" is slightly less clear than the reference translation's ""sludge gathers in some places."" The machine translation implies that the places are actively gathering sludge, while the reference translation simply states that sludge gathers in those places.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor issues with punctuation and phrasing that make it slightly less clear than the reference translation. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by following the reference translation's structure more closely.

Machine translation: The General Affairs Council has made the final preparations to direct the draft EU budget to the European Council.
Reference translation: The General Affairs Council has made the final preparations to forward the draft EU budget to the European Council meeting.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""direct"" while the reference translation uses ""forward.""
2. The machine translation omits ""meeting"" from the end of the sentence.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""direct"" instead of ""forward"" changes the meaning slightly. ""Direct"" implies that the General Affairs Council is guiding the draft EU budget towards the European Council, while ""forward"" implies that the General Affairs Council is sending the draft EU budget to the European Council. The reference translation's use of ""forward"" is more accurate in this context.
2. The omission of ""meeting"" in the machine translation changes the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation specifies that the draft EU budget is being sent to a meeting of the European Council, while the machine translation implies that the draft EU budget is being sent to the European Council in general, without specifying a meeting.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The use of ""direct"" instead of ""forward"" and the omission of ""meeting"" change the meaning of the sentence and make the machine translation less clear. The quality of the machine translation is therefore lower than that of the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Normaalteadus üldiselt hoiab filosoofiast eemale, ja küllap õigusega.
Machine translation: Normal science in general is keeping the philosophy away, and rightly so.
Reference translation: Normal science in general is keeping a distance from philosophy , and probably rightly so .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""the philosophy away"" while the reference translation uses ""a distance from philosophy.""
2. The machine translation uses ""rightly so"" while the reference translation uses ""probably rightly so.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The phrase ""the philosophy away"" in the machine translation is less clear than ""a distance from philosophy"" in the reference translation. The machine translation implies that normal science is completely removing philosophy, while the reference translation suggests a more nuanced relationship between the two.
2. The machine translation uses ""rightly so"" to convey certainty, while the reference translation uses ""probably rightly so"" to convey a sense of uncertainty or possibility. This difference in tone and certainty may affect the overall meaning and quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The differences in phrasing and tone may lead to a less clear and less nuanced understanding of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: The government forces rejected the rebels, and the rebel positions outside the city were also given around 30 dinner.
Reference translation: Government forces repulsed the rebels , and rebel positions outside the city were given about 30 air strikes .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""The government forces rejected the rebels"" vs. ""Government forces repulsed the rebels"": The machine translation uses ""rejected"" while the reference translation uses ""repulsed."" These words have similar meanings, but ""repulsed"" is more specific to the context of military conflict.
2. ""the rebel positions outside the city were also given around 30 dinner"" vs. ""rebel positions outside the city were given about 30 air strikes"": The machine translation mentions ""dinner"" while the reference translation mentions ""air strikes."" ""Dinner"" is not relevant to the context, and it seems like a mistranslation.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation has some issues with accuracy and context. The use of ""dinner"" instead of ""air strikes"" is a clear mistranslation that affects the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, the choice of ""rejected"" over ""repulsed"" is less specific to the context of military conflict.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is not high, as it contains significant inaccuracies and contextual issues compared to the reference translation.

Machine translation: Margna wants to marry her wife and brings Marek's trip to Morocco to life.
Reference translation: Margna wants to get married to his girlfriend and gifts Mare a trip to Morocco.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""her wife"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""his girlfriend"" is used.
2. In the machine translation, ""brings Marek's trip to Morocco to life"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""gifts Mare a trip to Morocco"" is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""her wife"" in the machine translation is incorrect because the source text implies a male subject (Margna) and a female object (naise), not a same-sex relationship. The reference translation correctly identifies the gender of the subject and object.
2. The phrase ""brings Marek's trip to Morocco to life"" in the machine translation is not a direct translation of the source text and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The reference translation, ""gifts Mare a trip to Morocco,"" is a more accurate translation of the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of low quality because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and contains errors in gender identification. The reference translation is of higher quality as it accurately translates the source text and maintains the intended meaning.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. ""viiest mängust"" (last five) vs. ""games"": The machine translation correctly translates ""viiest mängust"" as ""last five.""
2. ""kaotas"" (lost) vs. ""lost"": The machine translation correctly translates ""kaotas"" as ""lost.""
3. ""neli"" (four) vs. ""four"": The machine translation correctly translates ""neli"" as ""four.""
4. ""ja suutis viigistada"" (and was only able to fuss) vs. ""and was only able to tie one"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""ja suutis viigistada"" as ""and was only able to fuss"" instead of ""and was only able to tie one."" This is a significant error, as ""fuss"" does not convey the same meaning as ""tie.""
5. ""vaid ühe"" (only one) vs. ""one"": The machine translation correctly translates ""vaid ühe"" as ""only one.""

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the translation of ""ja suutis viigistada"" as ""and was only able to fuss"" is a significant error. This error affects the overall meaning of the sentence. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is not high.

Reference translation: On the same day , the 1st Battalion of the 47th Regiment , which had been upgraded , was withdrawn from the old cemetery of Vaivara and sent to Krivasoo .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""47th embryonic element I. pataljon"" vs. ""1st Battalion of the 47th Regiment"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""47. rügemendi I. pataljon"" as ""47th embryonic element I. pataljon"" instead of ""1st Battalion of the 47th Regiment.""
2. ""thrown out in an old calibre from the ground"" vs. ""withdrawn from the old cemetery of Vaivara"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""tõmmati Vaivara vanalt kalmistult välja"" as ""thrown out in an old calibre from the ground"" instead of ""withdrawn from the old cemetery of Vaivara.""
3. ""put on the front in crisis"" vs. ""sent to Krivasoo"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""suunati rindele Krivasoosse"" as ""put on the front in crisis"" instead of ""sent to Krivasoo.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has several inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. It misinterprets the meaning of ""47. rügemendi I. pataljon"" as ""47th embryonic element I. pataljon"" instead of ""1st Battalion of the 47th Regiment."" It also incorrectly translates ""tõmmati Vaivara vanalt kalmistult välja"" as ""thrown out in an old calibre from the ground"" instead of ""withdrawn from the old cemetery of Vaivara."" Finally, it translates ""suunati rindele Krivasoosse"" as ""put on the front in crisis"" instead of ""sent to Krivasoo.""

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is poor due to these inaccuracies and misunderstandings of the source text.

Reference translation: From the point of view of the realisation of the necessary elements of an offence , it does not matter for what purpose the material with prohibited content was produced , stored or made available .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""reorganisation of the offence"" while the reference translation uses ""realisation of the necessary elements of an offence"". The reference translation is more accurate as it conveys the idea of realizing the necessary components of a crime.
2. The machine translation uses ""it has been forbidden"" while the reference translation uses ""with prohibited content"". The reference translation is more accurate as it specifies the content of the material that is prohibited.
3. The machine translation uses ""produce, store or make available"" while the reference translation uses ""produced, stored or made available"". The reference translation is more accurate as it uses the past tense to match the context of the source text.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. It misses some important details and uses less accurate phrasing in some parts. The reference translation is more accurate and better captures the meaning of the source text.

Machine translation: It should be noted as an honour that it was this image of human nature that inspired political liberalism.
Reference translation: It should be noted in its honour that it was this image of human nature that inspired political liberalism.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of the prepositions ""as"" and ""in."" The machine translation uses ""as an honour,"" while the reference translation uses ""in its honour.""

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the differences on the overall meaning and quality of the translation.

The use of ""as an honour"" in the machine translation slightly changes the meaning of the sentence. It implies that the image of human nature is an honour itself, whereas the reference translation implies that the image of human nature is being honoured for inspiring political liberalism.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the slight change in meaning due to the different prepositions affects the overall quality. The reference translation is more precise in conveying the intended meaning of the source text.

Machine translation: He is fighting for what he already believes in and attacking the fact that he is not undermining this power within the community.
Reference translation: He is fighting for what he already believes in and attacking the opponent, so that he is not undermining its power within the community.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation says ""attacking the fact that he is not undermining this power within the community,"" while the reference translation says ""attacking the opponent, so that he is not undermining its power within the community.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the way it describes the subject's action. The reference translation clearly states that the subject is attacking the opponent, while the machine translation implies that the subject is attacking a fact (the fact that he is not undermining the power within the community). This difference in interpretation changes the meaning of the sentence and may lead to confusion for the reader.

2. The machine translation uses ""banditry forces"" while the reference translation uses ""forces from Riga.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""it was intended"" vs. ""they intended"" does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both phrases convey the idea that someone (or something) had a purpose or intention. However, the reference translation is more natural and clear in English.
2. The use of ""banditry forces"" vs. ""forces from Riga"" changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Banditry forces"" implies a general group of criminals or rebels, while ""forces from Riga"" specifically refers to a group of people or soldiers from Riga, a city in Latvia. This difference in meaning could lead to a different understanding of the situation described in the sentence.

2. The machine translation uses the phrase ""cared for"" while the reference translation uses the phrase ""cared for the most.""

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not an accurate representation of the source text. It misses the main idea of the source, which is about the importance of love for people in general, not just the most vulnerable individuals. The reference translation captures this main idea more accurately.

Step 5: Provide a final evaluation of the machine translation.

The quality of the machine translation is poor. It does not accurately convey the main idea of the source text, and it is less coherent than the reference translation.

Machine translation: Eminarmos also say, people consider each other to be the most beautiful, just as dogs say each other.
Reference translation: Emicharmos also says that people consider each other to be the most beautiful , just as dogs consider each other .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Eminarmos"" is used instead of ""Epicharmos"" in the source.
2. In the machine translation, ""people consider each other to be the most beautiful, just as dogs say each other"" is used instead of ""people consider each other to be the most beautiful , just as dogs consider each other"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The misspelling of ""Eminarmos"" instead of ""Epicharmos"" is a minor error that does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of ""dogs say each other"" instead of ""dogs consider each other."" This change slightly alters the meaning of the sentence, as ""say"" implies that the dogs are verbally communicating with each other, while ""consider"" implies that the dogs are thinking or perceiving each other as beautiful.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the use of ""say"" instead of ""consider"" in the second difference slightly alters the meaning of the sentence. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement in accurately conveying the intended meaning of the source text.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""give up"" in the machine translation vs. ""generate"" in the reference translation.
2. ""andmast"" in the source is not present in the machine translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

108	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: See sundis prantslased välja, ja umbes samal ajal ründas kolmas kolonn Sokolnitzi kantsi.
Machine translation: It forced the French out, and at about the same time it attacked the Third Colonn Sokolnitz Canaries.
Reference translation: It forced the French out , and at about the same time the third column attacked the Sokolnitz castle .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""Third Colonn Sokolnitz Canaries,"" while the reference translation mentions ""Sokolnitz castle.""
2. The machine translation uses ""it"" as a pronoun, while the reference translation uses ""the third column.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The mention of ""Canaries"" in the machine translation is incorrect, as it refers to a group of islands and not a castle. This is a significant error in the translation.
2. The use of ""it"" as a pronoun in the machine translation is less clear than the reference translation, which specifically refers to ""the third column."" This makes the machine translation less precise.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is not very good. It contains significant errors and lacks the clarity of the reference translation.

109	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Osa neist on üleriigilised, osa regionaalsed, osa suunatud peamiselt välisriikide elanikkonnale.
Machine translation: Some of them are nationwide, some regional, mainly targeted at foreign populations.
Reference translation: Some of them are nationwide , some regional , some mainly targeted at foreign populations .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of the word ""some"" in the reference translation. The machine translation uses ""some"" twice, while the reference translation uses ""some"" three times.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the differences on the quality of the translation.

The use of ""some"" three times in the reference translation provides a more precise and clear description of the different types of organizations mentioned in the source. The machine translation, on the other hand, may be slightly less clear due to the repetition of ""some.""

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate and captures the main ideas of the source text. However, the repetition of ""some"" may cause slight confusion for the reader. The reference translation is clearer and more precise, making it a better choice for conveying the meaning of the source text.

Conclusion: The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using the word ""some"" only once, as in the reference translation. This would provide a clearer and more precise description of the different types of organizations mentioned in the source text.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Vaatamata eredatele, kuid harvadele eranditele tundub inimeste loomupärane egoistlikkus kaheldamatuna.
Machine translation: Despite erroneous, but rare exceptions, the natural egoism of the people seems unquestionable.
Reference translation: Despite glaring , but rare exceptions , the natural egoism of the human being seems unquestionable .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""erroneous"" while the reference translation uses ""glaring.""
2. The machine translation uses ""people"" while the reference translation uses ""human being.""
3. The machine translation omits the comma after ""rare exceptions.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""erroneous"" instead of ""glaring"" changes the meaning slightly. ""Erroneous"" implies that the exceptions are incorrect or mistaken, while ""glaring"" implies that they are obvious or striking. This difference in meaning may affect the overall quality of the translation.
2. The use of ""people"" instead of ""human being"" is a minor difference in this context. Both terms are appropriate, but ""human being"" is more formal and precise. This difference in word choice may not significantly impact the quality of the translation.
3. The omission of the comma after ""rare exceptions"" is a minor error in punctuation. This error does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in word choice and punctuation that may affect the overall quality. The translation is generally good, but there is room for improvement.

Machine translation: In both states, Mitt Romney won the elections; secondly, Rick Santorum remained.
Reference translation: In both states , Mitt Romney won the elections ; with Rick Santorum coming second .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""secondly"" while the reference translation uses ""with.""
2. The machine translation says ""Rick Santorum remained"" while the reference translation says ""Rick Santorum coming second.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""secondly"" in the machine translation is not incorrect, but it is less clear than ""with"" in the reference translation. ""With"" provides a clearer connection between the two candidates, while ""secondly"" can be interpreted as a separate point or reason.
2. The machine translation's phrasing ""Rick Santorum remained"" is less clear than the reference translation's ""Rick Santorum coming second."" ""Remained"" implies that Rick Santorum stayed in the same position, while ""coming second"" clearly states that he finished in second place.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of the same quality as the reference translation. The use of ""secondly"" and ""remained"" makes the machine translation less clear and less accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

Machine translation: He kicked his first performance in January of next year, and then appealed to the Wagner 'Reinikulla' and 'Valletta' in Hungarian.
Reference translation: He postponed his first performance until the January of next year , and then performed Wagner 's "" Rheingold "" and ' Valkyrie ' in Hungarian .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""kicked his first performance"" vs. ""postponed his first performance"": The machine translation uses the word ""kicked"" which is not accurate in this context. The correct term is ""postponed.""
2. ""in January of next year"" is correct in both translations.
3. ""and then appealed to the Wagner 'Reinikulla' and 'Valletta'"" vs. ""and then performed Wagner 's "" Rheingold "" and ' Valkyrie '"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""kandis"" as ""appealed to"" and misinterprets ""Reinikulla"" and ""Valküüri"" as ""Valletta."" The correct translations are ""Reinikulla"" and ""Valkyrie.""
4. ""in Hungarian"" is correct in both translations.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has several inaccuracies, including the incorrect translation of ""kandis"" and the misinterpretation of ""Reinikulla"" and ""Valküüri."" Additionally, the use of ""kicked"" instead of ""postponed"" is not appropriate in this context.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""spokesman"" vs. ""spokesperson""
2. ""not going to meet"" vs. ""not going to accept""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The use of ""spokesman"" in the machine translation is a gender-specific term, while ""spokesperson"" in the reference translation is gender-neutral. In this context, both terms are appropriate, but the reference translation is more inclusive.
2. The difference between ""not going to meet"" and ""not going to accept"" is subtle but important. ""Not going to meet"" implies that President Saakashvili will not engage with the Prime Minister's request at all, while ""not going to accept"" implies that he will not agree to the request but does not rule out the possibility of discussing it further. The reference translation more accurately captures the intended meaning of the source.

1. ""forerunner"" vs. ""predecessor""
2. ""direction"" vs. ""school""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""forerunner"" instead of ""predecessor"" changes the meaning slightly. A forerunner is someone who comes before and paves the way for others, while a predecessor is someone who comes before in a particular office or position. In this context, ""predecessor"" is more appropriate, as it implies that the cynics wanted to make him the first in their school or movement.
2. The use of ""direction"" instead of ""school"" also changes the meaning. ""Direction"" implies a general path or approach, while ""school"" refers to a specific group or movement. In this context, ""school"" is more appropriate, as it refers to the specific group of cynics.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""UPM"" is used instead of ""League of Nations"" in the reference translation.
2. The machine translation uses ""Member State"" while the reference translation uses ""member state.""
3. The machine translation does not use the word ""territory"" to describe the mandate.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""UPM"" instead of ""League of Nations"" is a significant error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. The correct term should be ""League of Nations.""
2. The capitalization of ""Member State"" is not necessary, and it should be written as ""member state"" to match the reference translation.
3. The omission of the word ""territory"" in the machine translation makes the meaning less clear. Including the word ""territory"" would make the machine translation more accurate.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the significant errors and omissions. The correct term ""League of Nations"" should be used, and the word ""territory"" should be included to make the meaning clear. The capitalization of ""Member State"" should also be corrected to match the reference translation.

3. The machine translation uses ""takes scientific findings into account"" while the reference translation uses ""turns scientific findings into knowledge"".

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The extra ""here"" in the machine translation does not change the meaning of the sentence but makes it slightly less clear.
2. The machine translation's use of ""unless there is a theory"" is less clear than the reference translation's ""if there is no theory"". The reference translation's phrasing is more concise and easier to understand.
3. The machine translation's use of ""takes scientific findings into account"" is less accurate than the reference translation's ""turns scientific findings into knowledge"". The reference translation more accurately captures the idea that scientific findings are transformed into knowledge.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is of moderate quality. It conveys the general meaning of the source text, but there are some inaccuracies and less clear phrasing compared to the reference translation. The machine translation could be improved by removing the extra ""here"", using ""if there is no theory"" instead of ""unless there is a theory"", and using ""turns scientific findings into knowledge"" instead of ""takes scientific findings into account"".

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Arutlus on rahuldav, kui räägitakse selgelt vastavalt ainele; kõikidest arutlustest ei tule ühtemoodi täpsust otsida, nagu ka mitte käsitööde puhul.
Machine translation: The debate is satisfactory when clearly speaking according to the substance; all discussions must not be sought in the same way as in the case of hand works.
Reference translation: An argument is satisfactory when clearly speaking according to the substance ; accuracy must not be sought in all arguments in the same way , as in the case of handicrafts .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""The debate"" while the reference translation uses ""An argument"".
2. The machine translation uses ""all discussions"" while the reference translation uses ""all arguments"".
3. The machine translation uses ""in the same way as in the case of hand works"" while the reference translation uses ""in the same way, as in the case of handicrafts"".

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The difference in the subject (""The debate"" vs ""An argument"") does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.
2. The difference in the object (""all discussions"" vs ""all arguments"") also does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.
3. The difference in the phrase (""in the same way as in the case of hand works"" vs ""in the same way, as in the case of handicrafts"") slightly impacts the meaning of the sentence. The machine translation uses ""hand works"" while the reference translation uses ""handicrafts"". These two terms are similar but not exactly the same. ""Hand works"" refers to any work done by hand, while ""handicrafts"" specifically refers to a type of work that is creative and artistic.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences in word choice that could impact the meaning slightly. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using the exact terms found in the reference translation.

2. The machine translation uses ""change the law"" while the reference translation uses ""transfer the right.""
3. The machine translation uses ""right of command"" while the reference translation uses ""right of disposal.""
4. The machine translation uses ""item"" while the reference translation uses ""an item.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""obligation"" in the machine translation is accurate, as it conveys the same meaning as ""party will be obliged"" in the reference translation.
2. The use of ""change the law"" in the machine translation is less accurate than ""transfer the right"" in the reference translation. ""Change the law"" implies a broader change in legislation, while ""transfer the right"" specifically refers to the transfer of a particular right.
3. The use of ""right of command"" in the machine translation is less accurate than ""right of disposal"" in the reference translation. ""Right of command"" implies the right to control or direct, while ""right of disposal"" implies the right to dispose of or use.
4. The use of ""item"" in the machine translation is accurate and conveys the same meaning as ""an item"" in the reference translation.

Reference translation: This is proven by the fact that Pope 's legate , on his own initiative , released the crusaders from their oath to continue the campaign against the Holy Land .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Christian warrants"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""crusaders."" The reference translation is more accurate as it specifically refers to the people involved in the crusades.
2. In the machine translation, ""Pühale Maale"" is translated as ""Pühale Maale,"" while the reference translation translates it as ""the Holy Land."" The reference translation is more accurate as it is the correct translation for the Estonian phrase.
3. The machine translation omits the word ""legate"" when referring to the Pope's representative, while the reference translation includes it. This omission makes the machine translation less accurate.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

3. The machine translation does not include the word ""armed"" in the description of the individuals.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""protected"" versus ""was protected"" changes the passive voice of the reference translation to an active voice in the machine translation. This changes the meaning slightly, as the reference translation emphasizes that the city itself was protected, while the machine translation implies that the city was responsible for protecting the people.
2. The use of ""people"" versus ""armed individuals"" is a minor difference, but it does change the meaning slightly. The reference translation specifies that these were armed individuals, while the machine translation simply refers to them as people.
3. The omission of the word ""armed"" in the machine translation is a significant error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation specifies that these were armed individuals, while the machine translation does not convey this information.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Paavst kohtus 7. mail 1980 ja 18. augustil 1985 Keenia hinduistidega.
Machine translation: The Pope met with Hindus on 7 May 1980 and 18 August 1985.
Reference translation: The Pope met with Kenyan Hindus on 7 May 1980 and 18 August 1985.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation is missing the word ""Kenyan"" which is present in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the differences on the quality of the translation.

The absence of the word ""Kenyan"" in the machine translation changes the meaning of the sentence, as it omits the specificity of the Hindus being from Kenya. This omission can lead to confusion for the reader, as they may not know that the Hindus mentioned are from Kenya.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is low, as it omits important information from the source text. The translation is not accurate and may cause confusion for the reader.

Step 5: Provide a corrected machine translation.

The Pope met with Kenyan Hindus on 7 May 1980 and 18 August 1985.

Machine translation: It is currently mainly trusted by highly optimistic markers, who are in favour of its materialistic version.
Reference translation: It is currently mainly trusted only by highly optimistic Marxists, who are in favour of its materialistic version.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""markers"" instead of ""Marxists"" in the sentence.
2. The machine translation omits the word ""only"" which is present in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""markers"" instead of ""Marxists"" changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Markers"" is not a correct term for the group of people being referred to in the source. This is a significant error in the translation.
2. The omission of the word ""only"" changes the meaning of the sentence as well. The reference translation implies that the source is trusted by this specific group and no one else, while the machine translation suggests that the source is trusted by a broader group of people. This is another significant error in the translation.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the significant errors in meaning and understanding of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and conveys the intended meaning of the source.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Canberra päevale eelneb tihtipeale kümnepäevane ürituste sari Celebrate Canberra.
Machine translation: Canberra's day is often preceded by a ten-day series of events in Celebrate Canberra.
Reference translation: Canberra Day is often preceded by a ten-day series of events , Celebrate Canberra .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Canberra's day"" while the reference translation uses ""Canberra Day.""
2. The machine translation uses ""in Celebrate Canberra"" while the reference translation uses ""Celebrate Canberra"" without ""in.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the noun phrase ""Canberra's day"" vs. ""Canberra Day"" is a minor issue. Both phrases convey the same meaning, but the reference translation is more common and preferred in English.
2. The difference in the prepositional phrase ""in Celebrate Canberra"" vs. ""Celebrate Canberra"" is more significant. The machine translation incorrectly uses the preposition ""in"" with the proper noun ""Celebrate Canberra,"" which is a festival or event, not a location. The reference translation correctly omits the preposition.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has two issues: the use of ""Canberra's day"" instead of ""Canberra Day"" and the incorrect use of the preposition ""in"" with ""Celebrate Canberra."" The reference translation is more accurate and preferred in English.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Kunagised vaated loodusele ei olnud vähem teaduslikud kui praegudes.
Machine translation: Artistic views on nature were no less scientific than the current one.
Reference translation: The former views on nature were no less scientific than the current ones.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Artistic views"" while the reference translation uses ""The former views.""
2. The machine translation uses ""the current one"" while the reference translation uses ""the current ones.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation inaccurately describes the views as ""artistic,"" while the source and reference translation refer to them as ""former"" or ""previous."" This difference in description changes the meaning of the sentence.
2. The machine translation uses ""the current one"" instead of ""the current ones,"" which is a grammatical error. The correct translation should agree with the plural ""views"" in the source and reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not accurate and does not fully capture the meaning of the source text. The quality of the Estonian-English translation is poor.

Machine translation: In order to counter this, the German army's leadership did not have any means at all.
Reference translation: The German army 's leadership did not seem to have any means at all to counter this.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""In order to counter this"" while the reference translation uses ""to counter this.""
2. The machine translation uses ""the German army's leadership"" while the reference translation uses ""The German army 's leadership.""
3. The machine translation uses ""did not have any means at all"" while the reference translation uses ""did not seem to have any means at all.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the phrase ""In order to counter this"" vs. ""to counter this"" does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both phrases convey the same idea of addressing a problem.
2. The difference in the capitalization of ""the German army's leadership"" vs. ""The German army 's leadership"" is a minor grammatical error that does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. The difference in the phrases ""did not have any means at all"" vs. ""did not seem to have any means at all"" is more significant. The machine translation implies that the German army's leadership had no means to counter the problem, while the reference translation suggests that it appeared as though they had no means to counter the problem. This difference in meaning could impact the overall understanding of the sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there is a significant difference in meaning between the phrases ""did not have any means at all"" and ""did not seem to have any means at all."" The machine translation could be improved by more accurately conveying the meaning of the source text.

2. The machine translation has a comma at the end of the sentence, while the reference translation does not.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences on the quality of the machine translation.

1. The space before the apostrophe in ""Estonia's"" does not significantly affect the meaning or quality of the translation. It is a minor formatting issue that can be easily corrected.
2. The comma at the end of the sentence is a more significant issue. In the reference translation, the comma is used to set off the introductory phrase ""This is the longest period in Estonia's history,"" from the rest of the sentence. The machine translation's use of the comma at the end of the sentence is incorrect and disrupts the flow of the sentence.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but there are some minor issues that need to be addressed. The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text, but the incorrect use of the comma at the end of the sentence detracts from the overall quality.

Reference translation: The Thai Parliament , by 310 votes in favour of the country 's new Prime Minister , electedd Samak Sundaravej , chairman of the People 's Power Party , the party that won the elections .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""People's Opposition Party"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""People's Power Party"" is used.
2. In the machine translation, ""the same Sundaravej"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""Samak Sundaravej"" is used.
3. In the machine translation, ""the party that won the elections"" is mentioned at the end of the sentence, while in the reference translation, it is mentioned earlier in the sentence.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the party name is a minor error, as ""People's Opposition Party"" and ""People's Power Party"" could potentially refer to the same party. However, the reference translation is more accurate in this case.
2. The difference in the name of the individual (Samak Sundaravej vs. the same Sundaravej) is a minor error, as both refer to the same person. However, the reference translation is more accurate in this case.
3. The difference in the placement of ""the party that won the elections"" does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both translations convey the same information.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with only minor differences from the reference translation. The quality of the machine translation is good, but the reference translation is slightly more accurate.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: The new Secretary of Justice was due to take office on 9 March, but it was postponed to 31 March due to the election period for the State.
Reference translation: The new Chancellor of Justice was due to take office on 9 March , but it was postponed to 31 March due to the election period for the Riigikogu .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, the position is translated as ""Secretary of Justice,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""Chancellor of Justice.""
2. In the machine translation, the reason for the postponement is mentioned as ""the election period for the State,"" while in the reference translation, it is mentioned as ""the election period for the Riigikogu.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the position translation (""Secretary of Justice"" vs. ""Chancellor of Justice"") may be due to the fact that the machine translation does not accurately capture the specific Estonian term for the position. The reference translation correctly translates the position as ""Chancellor of Justice,"" which is more accurate in this context.
2. The difference in the reason for the postponement (""the election period for the State"" vs. ""the election period for the Riigikogu"") may be due to the machine translation not accurately capturing the specific Estonian term for the Riigikogu (the Estonian parliament). The reference translation correctly translates the reason as ""the election period for the Riigikogu,"" which is more accurate in this context.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some inaccuracies in capturing the specific terms from the source text. The reference translation is more accurate in translating the position and the reason for the postponement. The overall quality of the machine translation is not high, and it would be beneficial to have a more accurate translation.

3. ""some kind of"" vs. no additional qualifier

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. ""flagrant assumption"" and ""bold assumption"" both convey the idea of an assumption that is not based on solid evidence, but ""flagrant"" has a stronger connotation of being inappropriate or unacceptable. The reference translation's choice of ""bold"" is more neutral and accurate in this context.
2. ""declassification"" and ""falsification"" are different concepts.

Machine translation: This is certainly not what is usually understood by the principle of equality.
Reference translation: This is certainly not what is usually understood as the principle of equality.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of the preposition ""by"" in the machine translation and ""as"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the meaning of the different words and phrases.

In this case, the prepositions ""by"" and ""as"" have slightly different meanings. ""By"" implies that something is done or created through the agency of someone or something, while ""as"" implies that something is regarded or treated as something else.

Step 4: Determine which translation is more accurate.

In the context of the sentence, the more accurate translation would be ""as"" because it conveys the idea that the principle of equality is not understood in the way the source is describing. The use of ""by"" would imply that the principle of equality is created or done through the source, which is not the intended meaning.

Step 5: Make a conclusion.

Machine translation: The plan was opposed by local copies who feared that their extensive rights would be curtailed by the new rural Mr.
Reference translation: The plan was opposed by local vassals who feared that the new landlord would curtail their extensive rights.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""local copies"" vs. ""local vassals""
2. ""who feared that their extensive rights would be curtailed"" vs. ""who feared that the new landlord would curtail their extensive rights""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The term ""local copies"" is incorrect in this context. The correct term should be ""local vassals"" as in the reference translation. This is a significant error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence.
2. The machine translation incorrectly separates the subject and the object in the sentence. In the reference translation, the subject and the object are correctly connected, making the sentence more coherent.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has some issues that affect the overall quality. The incorrect use of ""local copies"" instead of ""local vassals"" significantly changes the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, the separation of the subject and the object in the machine translation makes the sentence less coherent.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the incorrect use of terms and the lack of coherence in the sentence structure. The reference translation is more accurate and coherent, making it a better representation of the source text.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""make possible"" while the reference translation uses ""chamge"". The meaning of these two phrases is similar, but ""chamge"" is more specific to the context of the sentence.
2. The machine translation omits the comma after ""or against everything,"" while the reference translation includes it. This comma is important for clarity and readability.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor differences from the reference translation. The omission of the comma and the use of ""make possible"" instead of ""chamge"" slightly reduce the quality of the translation. However, the overall meaning is still clear and understandable.

Quality evaluation: The machine translation is of good quality, but it could be improved by including the comma and using the more specific term ""chamge"" instead of ""make possible"".
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: See ei ole leppimine, kui see tuleb andestaja ausast usust, et amoraalne tegu ei ole hea tõend tegija hinge kohta.
Machine translation: It is not reconciliation when it comes to the honest belief of the forgive that an amoral act is not good evidence of the perpetrator's soul.
Reference translation: It is not reconciliation if it comes from the forgiving honest faith that an amoral act is not good evidence of the perpetrator 's soul .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""when it comes to"" while the reference translation uses ""if it comes from.""
2. The machine translation uses ""the forgive"" while the reference translation uses ""forgiving.""
3. The machine translation uses ""honest belief"" while the reference translation uses ""honest faith.""
4. The machine translation uses ""perpetrator's soul"" while the reference translation uses ""perpetrator 's soul.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""when it comes to"" in the machine translation is less clear than ""if it comes from"" in the reference translation. The reference translation better conveys the conditional nature of the statement.
2. The use of ""the forgive"" in the machine translation is grammatically incorrect. The correct term is ""forgiving.""
3. The use of ""honest belief"" in the machine translation is less accurate than ""honest faith"" in the reference translation. ""Honest faith"" better captures the essence of the original source.
4. The use of ""perpetrator's soul"" in the machine translation is more accurate than ""perpetrator 's soul"" in the reference translation. The machine translation correctly uses an apostrophe to indicate possession.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some inaccuracies and is less clear than the reference translation. The quality of the machine translation is not high.

Machine translation: As a rule, the change of government did not bring about any significant changes to the path to action.
Reference translation: As a rule, the change of government did not bring about any significant changes in the activities of the town hall.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""As a rule"" while the reference translation uses ""As a rule,"". The extra comma in the reference translation is a minor difference and does not affect the meaning.
2. The machine translation says ""to the path to action"" while the reference translation says ""in the activities of the town hall."" The machine translation is less specific and could be interpreted in different ways.
3. The machine translation does not mention ""town hall"" which is present in the reference translation. This omission may cause the meaning to be less clear.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it is less specific and clear than the reference translation. The omission of ""town hall"" and the less specific phrase ""to the path to action"" make the machine translation slightly less accurate than the reference translation.

Machine translation: Justinianus II tried to break the urban cartocracy by imposing heavy taxes and by-persons on key positions of the administrative system.
Reference translation: Justinian II tried to break the urban aristocrats by imposing heavy taxes and appointing outsiders to key positions in the administrative system.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""urban cartocracy"" while the reference translation uses ""urban aristocrats.""
2. The machine translation uses ""by-persons"" while the reference translation uses ""outsiders.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. ""Urban cartocracy"" is not a correct translation of ""linnaaristokraat."" The term ""cartocracy"" refers to a government controlled by chariot-riding warriors, which is not related to the context of the source. The reference translation correctly translates ""linnaaristokraat"" as ""urban aristocrats,"" which refers to a social class of wealthy and powerful people living in a city.
2. ""By-persons"" is not a correct translation of ""kõrvaliste isikute."" The term ""by-persons"" is not a standard English term and does not make sense in this context. The reference translation correctly translates ""kõrvaliste isikute"" as ""outsiders,"" which refers to people who are not part of the urban aristocracy.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is of low quality because it contains two significant errors in translation. The use of ""urban cartocracy"" and ""by-persons"" are not accurate translations of the source text and do not convey the intended meaning.

Source: Inimese päritolu uurimiseks on tarvis seletada seda inimese eripära ning kirjeldada evolutsiooniprotsesse, mis selle esile kutsusid.
Machine translation: Research into the origin of human beings needs to explain this human specificity and describe the evolution processes that brought it about.
Reference translation: Research into the origin of human beings needs to explain this human specificity and describe the evolutionary processes that brought it about.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

Difference 1: The machine translation uses ""evolution processes"" while the reference translation uses ""evolutionary processes.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The difference between ""evolution processes"" and ""evolutionary processes"" is minor, as both phrases convey the same general meaning. However, the reference translation is more accurate, as it includes the adjective ""evolutionary"" to describe the processes. This small difference in wording does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence, but it does make the reference translation slightly more precise.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is mostly good, but it could be improved by using the more accurate term ""evolutionary processes"" instead of ""evolution processes.""

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Rõivaste värvid on kirkad, samas 14. sajandi freskod on Palaiologoste perioodi klassikalises stiilis.
Machine translation: Clothing colours are surgical, while the 14th century shelf dogs are in the classic style of the Palaiologisation period.
Reference translation: Clothing colours are bright , while the 14th century frescos are in the classic style of the Palaiologos period .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. Machine translation: ""surgical"" vs. Reference translation: ""bright""
2. Machine translation: ""shelf dogs"" vs. Reference translation: ""frescos""
3. Machine translation: ""Palaiologisation period"" vs. Reference translation: ""Palaiologos period""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The word ""surgical"" is not an accurate translation of ""kirkad"" (bright). The machine translation incorrectly describes the clothing colors as surgical, which does not convey the intended meaning of bright colors.
2. The phrase ""shelf dogs"" is not a correct translation of ""14. sajandi freskod"" (14th century frescos). The machine translation incorrectly translates ""freskod"" as ""dogs"" instead of ""frescos,"" which changes the meaning of the sentence.
3. The term ""Palaiologisation period"" is not a correct translation of ""Palaiologote perioodi"" (Palaiologos period). The machine translation incorrectly adds the suffix ""isation"" to ""Palaiologos,"" which does not accurately represent the original term.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of low quality due to the incorrect translations of key terms and phrases. The reference translation more accurately conveys the meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source text in Estonian.
Source: Rünnakus hukkus vähemalt 8 inimest, nende seas ka 4 välismaalast.

Step 2: Read the machine translation in English.
Machine translation: At least 8 people died in the attack, including 4 foreigners.

Step 3: Read the reference translation in English.
Reference translation: At least 8 people died in the attack , including 4 foreigners .

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation.
Both the machine translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning: ""At least 8 people died in the attack, including 4 foreigners.""

Step 5: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.
There are no significant differences between the machine translation and the reference translation. The only minor difference is the use of a comma in the reference translation, which is not present in the machine translation. However, this does not affect the overall meaning or quality of the translation.

Step 6: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is of high quality, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is very similar to the reference translation. The only minor difference is the use of a comma, which does not impact the overall quality of the translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Prantsusmaal toimus kuue peamise presidendikandidaadi esimene teledebatt.
Machine translation: France held its first television debate on the six main presidential candidates.
Reference translation: France held its first television debate of the six main presidential candidates.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

In the machine translation, the phrase ""on the six main presidential candidates"" is used, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""of the six main presidential candidates.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The difference between the two phrases is subtle but important. The machine translation uses ""on"" to indicate the topic of the debate, while the reference translation uses ""of"" to indicate the participants in the debate. The reference translation is more accurate because it correctly conveys that the debate involved the six main presidential candidates, rather than just being about them.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it has a minor error in the choice of preposition. The machine translation is still understandable and conveys the main idea of the source text, but it is not as accurate as the reference translation.

Step 5: Provide a final evaluation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate and understandable, but it has a minor error in the choice of preposition. The reference translation is more accurate and should be used as the preferred translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Eetiliste dispositsioonide kujunemine on inimestel looduslik, kuigi vajab kasvatust ja kätkeb konventsiooni.
Machine translation: The development of ethical positions is natural for people, even though they need upbringing and are associated with the Convention.
Reference translation: The development of ethical dispositions is natural for people , even though it requires upbringing and entails convention .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""ethical positions"" vs. ""ethical dispositions""
2. ""need upbringing"" vs. ""requires upbringing""
3. ""are associated with the Convention"" vs. ""entails convention""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. ""ethical positions"" vs. ""ethical dispositions"": The machine translation uses ""positions"" while the reference translation uses ""dispositions."" Both words can be used to describe attitudes or beliefs, but ""dispositions"" is more accurate in this context, as it refers to a person's inherent tendencies or inclinations. The machine translation is slightly less accurate in this regard.

2. ""need upbringing"" vs. ""requires upbringing"": The machine translation uses ""need"" while the reference translation uses ""requires."" Both words convey the idea that upbringing is necessary for the development of ethical dispositions. However, ""requires"" is a stronger verb and more accurately conveys the necessity of upbringing in this context. The machine translation is slightly less accurate in this regard.

3. ""are associated with the Convention"" vs. ""entails convention"": The machine translation uses ""associated with"" while the reference translation uses ""entails."" ""Associated with"" suggests a connection or relationship between ethical dispositions and the Convention, while ""entails"" implies that the development of ethical dispositions involves or includes the Convention. The reference translation is more accurate in this regard, as it better conveys the idea that the Convention is an integral part of the development process.

Conclusion: The machine translation is slightly less accurate than the reference translation, with differences in word choice and the strength of the verbs used. The reference translation more accurately conveys the ideas presented in the source text.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Tõenäoliselt katsetati seekord sõjalaevade uputamiseks mõeldud rakette.
Machine translation: Probably this time there was a test of the wrecks intended for the sinking of warships.
Reference translation: Probably this time there was a test of rockets intended for the sinking of warships.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

In the machine translation, the term ""wrecks"" is used, while the reference translation uses the term ""rockets.""

Step 3: Analyze the context and meaning of the source text.

The source text is discussing a test that was likely conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a rocket system designed to sink warships.

Step 4: Determine the accuracy of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it uses the term ""wrecks"" instead of ""rockets."" This difference in terminology changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""wrecks"" implies destroyed or damaged ships, while ""rockets"" refers to the actual weapon system used to sink the ships.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The quality of the machine translation is low, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The use of the term ""wrecks"" instead of ""rockets"" leads to a misunderstanding of the purpose of the test.

In conclusion, the machine translation is not a good representation of the source text, and the quality is low due to the inaccurate translation of the term ""rakette"" (rocket) as ""wrecks.""

Machine translation: This artillery, in particular, was persistently demanded by the superiors of the artillery, because the sludge was quite serious in blocking their movement.
Reference translation: The commanders of the artillery demanded this especially , because the sludge tended to hinder their movement quite seriously .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""superiors of the artillery"" while the reference translation uses ""commanders of the artillery.""
2. The machine translation says ""this artillery, in particular,"" while the reference translation says ""this especially.""
3. The machine translation says ""the sludge was quite serious in blocking their movement"" while the reference translation says ""the sludge tended to hinder their movement quite seriously.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in word choice and phrasing that make it slightly less clear than the reference translation. The machine translation uses ""superiors of the artillery"" instead of ""commanders of the artillery,"" which is less specific and could be interpreted differently. Additionally, the machine translation uses ""this artillery, in particular"" instead of ""this especially,"" which changes the emphasis slightly. Finally, the machine translation says ""the sludge was quite serious in blocking their movement"" while the reference translation says ""the sludge tended to hinder their movement quite seriously."" The machine translation's phrasing is less clear and could be interpreted as the sludge being a more significant issue than the reference translation suggests.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has some differences in word choice and phrasing that make it slightly less clear than the reference translation.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""ex post consent"" is translated as ""ex post approval of the test vessels,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""ex post approval by the test subjects.""
2. In the machine translation, ""many tests encourage"" is translated as ""many tests encourage ex post approval of the test vessels,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""many tests encourage ex post approval by the test subjects.""

Step 3: Determine the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is not accurate in this case. The main difference is that the machine translation incorrectly translates ""ex post consent"" as ""ex post approval of the test vessels,"" while the reference translation correctly translates it as ""ex post approval by the test subjects."" This error changes the meaning of the sentence, making the machine translation less accurate than the reference translation.

Overall, the quality of the Estonian-English machine translation is poor due to the inaccurate translation of ""ex post consent"" and the resulting change in meaning.

Reference translation: In Ilovaisk , the fighting , the street battles and hand combat between government forces and the occupants continue .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Ilovak"" is used instead of ""Ilovaisk"" in the source and reference translation.
2. In the machine translation, ""street rivalry"" is used instead of ""street battles"" in the reference translation.
3. In the machine translation, ""the fight between government forces and the documents"" is used instead of ""the fight between government forces and the occupants"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the name ""Ilovak"" vs. ""Ilovaisk"" is likely a typo and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
2. The difference between ""street rivalry"" and ""street battles"" changes the tone and intensity of the situation described. ""Street rivalry"" implies a less intense, more ongoing conflict, while ""street battles"" implies more intense, immediate fighting. This difference may impact the quality of the translation.
3. The difference between ""the documents"" and ""the occupants"" is significant. ""The documents"" does not make sense in this context, as it implies a conflict between government forces and paperwork, rather than between government forces and an occupying force. This error greatly impacts the quality of the translation.

Machine translation: In addition, a US officer and an Iraqi interpreter were still killed in the attack.
Reference translation: In addition , a US officer and an Iraqi interpreter were killed in the attack .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of the word ""still"" in the machine translation. The reference translation does not include this word.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the difference on the overall meaning and quality of the translation.

The inclusion of the word ""still"" in the machine translation changes the meaning of the sentence. It implies that the US officer and Iraqi interpreter were killed in the attack, but there is some additional information or context that is not provided in the source text. The reference translation, on the other hand, conveys the information more directly and clearly, stating that the US officer and Iraqi interpreter were killed in the attack without any additional implications.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

The quality of the machine translation is lower than the reference translation because it introduces an additional implication that is not present in the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and clear in conveying the information from the source text.

Machine translation: Doubts are also disciplined in the moral meaning of what has been done.
Reference translation: Regret is also disciplined remembering of the moral significance of what has been done.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""Doubts"" vs. ""Regret"": The machine translation uses the word ""doubts"" while the reference translation uses ""regret.""
2. ""disciplined"" vs. ""disciplined remembering"": The machine translation uses the word ""disciplined"" alone, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""disciplined remembering.""
3. ""moral meaning"" vs. ""moral significance"": The machine translation uses the phrase ""moral meaning,"" while the reference translation uses ""moral significance.""
4. ""what has been done"" vs. ""what has been done"": Both translations use the same phrase.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""doubts"" instead of ""regret"" changes the meaning of the sentence. Doubts refer to uncertainty or lack of confidence, while regret refers to feelings of sadness or remorse for something done or left undone.
2. The omission of ""remembering"" in the machine translation changes the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation implies a conscious act of remembering the event, while the machine translation does not convey this aspect.
3. The use of ""moral meaning"" instead of ""moral significance"" slightly changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Moral meaning"" refers to the specific moral message or lesson, while ""moral significance"" refers to the overall importance or value of the event in a moral context.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Taolises demograafiliselt jätkusuutmatus olukorvas on ainsaks elanikkonna kasvu allikaks olnud ränne.
Machine translation: In such a demographic unsustainable situation, migration has been the only source of population growth.
Reference translation: In such a demographically unsustainable situation , migration has been the only source of population growth .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The only difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of the adjective ""demographically"" in the reference translation, which is missing in the machine translation.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the difference on the overall quality of the translation.

The use of ""demographically"" in the reference translation adds a level of specificity to the description of the unsustainable situation, making it clear that the issue is related to population demographics. The machine translation, without this adverb, is less precise and may be interpreted as referring to any unsustainable situation, not specifically a demographic one.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the omission of the adverb ""demographically"" results in a slight loss of precision. The overall quality of the translation is good, but it could be improved by including the missing adverb.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: And, as was the case, it is sometimes important in private life that what is accused is protected by someone.
Reference translation: And , as in a court , it is sometimes important in private life that the one who is accused is defended by someone .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""what is accused"" while the reference translation uses ""the one who is accused.""
2. The machine translation does not mention ""as in a court"" while the reference translation does.
3. The machine translation does not use a comma after ""And"" while the reference translation does.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""what is accused"" instead of ""the one who is accused"" is a minor difference and does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. However, the reference translation is more clear and precise.
2. The omission of ""as in a court"" from the machine translation is a significant difference. This phrase provides important context for understanding the situation being described, and its absence in the machine translation may lead to confusion for the reader.
3. The absence of the comma after ""And"" in the machine translation is a minor grammatical error that does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is moderate. While it captures the general meaning of the source text, it omits important context and has minor grammatical errors. The reference translation is clearer and more precise, making it a better representation of the source text.

Machine translation: Around 1 000 barrels were consumed a day in 2004.
Reference translation: Around 1 000 barrels of oil were consumed per day in 2004.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation does not include the word ""oil"" which is present in the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""a day"" while the reference translation uses ""per day.""

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences on the quality of the translation.
- The omission of the word ""oil"" in the machine translation can lead to confusion, as it is not clear what type of barrels are being referred to.
- The use of ""a day"" in the machine translation is less precise than ""per day"" in the reference translation. ""Per day"" clearly indicates the rate of consumption, while ""a day"" can be interpreted as an average or a general statement.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation due to the omission of the word ""oil"" and the less precise phrasing of ""a day."" The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.

Reference translation: Heraclitus saw every single thing in its ultimate specificity as a creation of the eternal chaos and war , and as perishing in this chaos and war .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Herakleito"" instead of ""Heraclitus"" in the first sentence.
2. The machine translation uses ""an eternal story of chaos and war"" instead of ""the eternal chaos and war"" in the first sentence.
3. The machine translation uses ""a death in this chaos and war"" instead of ""as perishing in this chaos and war"" in the second sentence.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The name ""Herakleitos"" is not translated correctly. It should be ""Heraclitus.""

Machine translation: NATO published the Russian invasion is evidenced by satellite images.
Reference translation: NATO published satellite images proving the Russian invasion.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""the Russian invasion is evidenced"" while the reference translation uses ""satellite images proving the Russian invasion.""
2. The machine translation uses ""the Russian invasion"" while the reference translation uses ""the Russian invasion.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation correctly identifies the subject of the sentence, which is ""NATO."" However, the phrasing ""the Russian invasion is evidenced"" is less clear and less concise than the reference translation ""satellite images proving the Russian invasion."" The machine translation could be improved by using a similar phrasing to the reference translation.
2. The machine translation correctly identifies the object of the sentence, which is ""the Russian invasion."" However, the phrasing ""the Russian invasion"" is less specific than the reference translation ""the Russian invasion.""

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Küsimus, mis teeb kaalutluse põhjendiks, on keeruline, ja pole selge, et kaalutlus, mis pole põhjend, ei puutu üldse asjasse.
Machine translation: The question of what makes the consideration a reason is a complex one, and it is not clear that consideration, which is not a reason, is completely irrelevant.
Reference translation: The question of what makes the consideration a reason is a complex one , and it is not clear that a consideration , which is not a reason , is completely irrelevant .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""consideration"" while the reference translation uses ""kaalutlus.""
2. The machine translation uses ""it is not clear"" while the reference translation uses ""pole selge.""
3. The machine translation uses ""completely irrelevant"" while the reference translation uses ""üldse asjasse.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The term ""kaalutlus"" is specific to Estonian law and is not accurately translated as ""consideration"" in English. The reference translation uses the term ""a consideration,"" which is more accurate.
2. The phrase ""pole selge"" is a direct translation of ""it is not clear"" and is accurate in both the machine and reference translations.
3. The phrase ""üldse asjasse"" is a direct translation of ""completely irrelevant"" and is accurate in both the machine and reference translations.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has a significant error in translating the term ""kaalutlus"" as ""consideration."" This error affects the overall quality of the translation. The other differences between the machine and reference translations are minor and do not significantly impact the quality of the translation.

Machine translation: Then Frankfurt is right, but Williams did not mean that.
Reference translation: Then Frankfurt is right , but Williams did not mean that .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The only difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the presence of a comma in the reference translation: ""Then Frankfurt is right , but Williams did not mean that .""

Step 3: Analyze the significance of the difference.

The comma in the reference translation is used to separate two independent clauses: ""Then Frankfurt is right"" and ""but Williams did not mean that."" The machine translation omits the comma, which can make the sentence harder to understand.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the omission of the comma makes the sentence less clear than the reference translation. The quality of the machine translation is good, but not perfect.

Step 5: Provide a final evaluation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation uses ""moral ceilings"" instead of ""point of origin of moral philosophy."" This is a significant difference, as ""moral ceilings"" is not a common phrase in English and does not accurately convey the meaning of the original source.
- The machine translation uses ""It has in mind"" instead of ""He refers to."" This is a minor difference, but it changes the subject of the sentence from a person (he) to an object (it). This change in subject can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is of low quality because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original source and has a significant difference in the choice of words. Additionally, the change in subject from a person to an object can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Võrreldes Platoniga tundub see nagu sõõm värsket õhku.
Machine translation: It looks like a friend of fresh air compared to Platon.
Reference translation: It feels like a breath of fresh air compared to Plato.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""It looks like"" vs. ""It feels like"": The machine translation uses ""looks like"" while the reference translation uses ""feels like."" The difference in these phrases is subtle, but ""feels like"" better conveys the sense of relief or freshness that the source is trying to express.
2. ""a friend of fresh air"" vs. ""a breath of fresh air"": The machine translation uses ""a friend of fresh air"" while the reference translation uses ""a breath of fresh air."" The phrase ""a breath of fresh air"" is more commonly used to describe something that is refreshing or welcome in comparison to something else.
3. ""compared to Platon"" vs. ""compared to Plato"": The machine translation uses the Estonian name ""Platon"" while the reference translation uses the English name ""Plato."" The reference translation is more accurate, as the source is likely referring to the ancient Greek philosopher Plato.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation has some issues in accurately conveying the meaning of the source text. The use of ""looks like"" instead of ""feels like"" and ""a friend of fresh air"" instead of ""a breath of fresh air"" make the translation less accurate. Additionally, the use of the Estonian name ""Platon"" instead of the English name ""Plato"" is a minor error that could be easily corrected.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is not very high. It captures the general idea of the source text but lacks the precision and accuracy of the reference translation.

Machine translation: The cumulative acquisition of innovation is, in principle, unlikely.
Reference translation: The cumulative acquisition of innovation is , even in principle , unlikely .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the placement of the comma. The machine translation has the comma after ""in principle,"" while the reference translation has it after ""even.""

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the differences on the meaning and quality of the translation.

The placement of the comma in the machine translation does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. Both translations convey the idea that the cumulative acquisition of innovation is unlikely, even in principle. However, the reference translation's use of the comma adds a slight emphasis on the word ""even,"" which may make the sentence sound more formal or nuanced.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

The machine translation is of high quality, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text. The difference in comma placement does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation. The machine translation is slightly less formal than the reference translation, but this difference is minor and does not detract from the overall quality.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""its Official Journal"" while the reference translation uses ""the State Gazette.""
2. The machine translation uses ""day after"" while the reference translation uses ""a day after.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the publication name (""its Official Journal"" vs. ""the State Gazette"") is a minor error, as both refer to the official publication of the European Commission. However, ""the State Gazette"" is more accurate in this context, as it is the official publication of Estonia.
2. The difference in the phrasing (""day after"" vs. ""a day after"") is a minor grammatical difference that does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. However, there are minor differences in the choice of words and phrasing. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using the more accurate term ""the State Gazette"" and the correct phrasing ""a day after.""

Machine translation: Some subsequent theories have also assumed that the ethical system should set an example by scientific theory.
Reference translation: Some subsequent theorists have also assumed that an ethical system should use a scientific theory as a model.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""Some subsequent theories"" vs ""Some subsequent theorists"": The machine translation refers to theories, while the reference translation refers to theorists.
2. ""should set an example by scientific theory"" vs ""should use a scientific theory as a model"": The machine translation suggests that the ethical system should serve as an example for scientific theory, while the reference translation suggests that the ethical system should use scientific theory as a model or guide.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. The main issue is the difference in referring to ""theories"" vs ""theorists"" and the difference in the relationship between the ethical system and scientific theory. The reference translation more accurately captures the intended meaning of the source text.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

Difference 1: ""non-linear"" vs. ""non-authentic""
Difference 2: ""quotation"" vs. ""quote""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

Difference 1: The machine translation uses ""non-linear"" while the reference translation uses ""non-authentic."" The correct translation should be ""non-authentic"" as it accurately conveys the meaning of the original text. The use of ""non-linear"" is incorrect and changes the meaning of the sentence.

Difference 2: The machine translation uses ""quotation"" while the reference translation uses ""quote."" Both ""quotation"" and ""quote"" are acceptable translations for ""tsitaadi"" in this context. However, ""quote"" is more commonly used in English, making the machine translation slightly less accurate in this regard.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of moderate quality. It captures the general meaning of the source text but contains some inaccuracies. The translation of ""non-linear"" instead of ""non-authentic"" is a significant error that changes the meaning of the sentence.

Reference translation: When the Prince of Cont remained in the north, Count Gages went down that road to the south.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""Prince of Cont"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""Prince"" is used without ""of Cont.""
2. In the machine translation, ""collapse of Gages"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""Count Gages"" is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""Prince of Cont"" in the machine translation is not accurate, as the reference translation simply uses ""Prince"" without ""of Cont."" This is a minor error, but it does affect the clarity of the translation.
2. The use of ""collapse of Gages"" in the machine translation is not accurate, as the reference translation uses ""Count Gages."" This is a more significant error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence by implying that Gages is a collapse rather than a person.

2. The machine translation uses ""a guest"" while the reference translation uses ""a visitor"".
3. The machine translation uses ""whom he could not even have expected in his dream"" while the reference translation uses ""he could have never even dreamed of"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The name ""Ahmed"" is likely a mistake, as the source text mentions ""Ahven"", which is a proper name in Estonian. The machine translation should have used ""Ahven"" instead of ""The Ahmed"".
2. The difference between ""a guest"" and ""a visitor"" is minor and does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence. Both translations are acceptable.
3. The difference between ""whom he could not even have expected in his dream"" and ""he could have never even dreamed of"" is more significant. The machine translation uses a more complex and less natural phrasing, while the reference translation uses a simpler and more natural phrasing.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of moderate quality. It captures the general meaning of the source text but uses less natural phrasing and a mistake in the name. The reference translation is clearer and more natural, making it a better translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Eesti Riigikogu esimees Ene Ergma viibis visiidil Elvas.
Machine translation: President of the Estonian Assembly, Ene Ergma, was present at the visit in Elvas.
Reference translation: President of the Estonian Riigikogu , Ene Ergma , was on a visit to Elva .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Estonian Assembly"" while the reference translation uses ""Estonian Riigikogu.""
2. The machine translation says Ene Ergma was ""present at the visit"" while the reference translation says she was ""on a visit.""
3. The machine translation mentions ""Elvas"" while the reference translation mentions ""Elva.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The term ""Estonian Assembly"" is not accurate. The correct term is ""Estonian Riigikogu."" This is a minor error, but it does affect the quality of the translation.
2. The phrase ""present at the visit"" is not as accurate as ""on a visit."" The former implies that Ene Ergma was already in Elvas and the visit was taking place, while the latter implies that she traveled to Elvas for the visit. This is a more significant error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence.
3. The machine translation has the incorrect name of the location, ""Elvas"" instead of ""Elva."" This is another minor error that affects the quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some minor errors that affect the quality of the translation. The reference translation is more accurate in terms of the terms used and the meaning of the sentence.

Machine translation: At the same time, writing a brief article seemed particularly difficult, so writing more work started to look like the right alternative.
Reference translation: At the same time , writing a brief article seemed particularly difficult , so writing a larger work started to look like the right alternative .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""more work"" while the reference translation uses ""a larger work.""
2. The machine translation omits the comma after ""At the same time"" and before ""writing a brief article.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the choice of words (""more work"" vs. ""a larger work"") does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both phrases convey the idea of writing something more extensive than a brief article. However, ""a larger work"" is more precise and better reflects the original Estonian text.
2. The omitted comma in the machine translation affects the sentence structure and readability. The comma in the reference translation helps to separate the introductory phrase from the main clause, making the sentence easier to read and understand.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor issues that affect the quality. The translation of ""suurema teose"" as ""more work"" is not as precise as ""a larger work"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Compare the main concepts in the machine translation to the reference translation.

In the machine translation, the main concepts are: Regular ITS infrastructure, two hubs, actual rule, possible rule.

Step 4: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several ways:

1. The source text is about ""rule utilitarianism,"" while the machine translation refers to the ""regular ITS infrastructure."" ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) is not related to the source text, which is about a philosophical concept.
2. The source text mentions ""two subcategories,"" while the machine translation refers to ""two hubs."" The term ""hubs"" is not appropriate in this context, as it is related to networking and not to philosophical concepts.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is of low quality because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Nädal aega hiljem kutsuti Püha Haua kirikus kokku kirkunõukogu, et määrata uuele Jeruusalemma kuningriigile kuningas.
Machine translation: A week later, in the Holy Haua Church, a passion council was called to appoint a kingdom to the new Jerusalem Queen.
Reference translation: A week later , a church council was assmbled in the Holy Tomb Church to appoint a king for the new Jerusalem Kingdom .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""Holy Haua Church"" vs ""Holy Tomb Church"": The machine translation has a slight error in the name of the church. It should be ""Holy Tomb Church"" instead of ""Holy Haua Church"".
2. ""passion council"" vs ""church council"": The machine translation uses the term ""passion council"" which is not accurate. The correct term is ""church council"".
3. ""appoint a kingdom to the new Jerusalem Queen"" vs ""appoint a king for the new Jerusalem Kingdom"": The machine translation has a significant error in the purpose of the council. It should be ""appoint a king for the new Jerusalem Kingdom"" instead of ""appoint a kingdom to the new Jerusalem Queen"".

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation has some errors in the names of the church and the purpose of the council. However, it does convey the general meaning of the source text. The overall quality of the machine translation can be considered as fair, but it needs some improvements to be more accurate.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Pärast esimese paradigma leidmist pole olemas uurimistööd ilma paradigmata.
Machine translation: After the first paradigm, there is no research without a paradigm.
Reference translation: After the first paradigm is found , there is no research without a paradigm .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation omits the word ""is found"" from the source sentence.
2. The machine translation does not use a comma to separate the two clauses.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences on the quality of the machine translation.

1. The omission of ""is found"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that there is no research after the first paradigm is found, rather than after the first paradigm exists.
2. The lack of a comma makes the sentence more difficult to understand, as it combines the two clauses into one long, complex sentence.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is of moderate quality. It captures the general meaning of the source sentence but omits important information and lacks proper punctuation. The reference translation is clearer and more accurate, making it a better representation of the source sentence.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: It is thought that it has affected Greek, literature, sport, science, dance, music, politics and religion.
Reference translation: It is thought that it has affected Greek language , literature , sport , science , dance , music , politics and religion .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses commas to separate the items in the list, while the reference translation uses spaces. This is a minor difference and does not significantly affect the meaning or quality of the translation.
2. The machine translation omits the word ""language"" before ""Greek"" in the list. This is a more significant difference, as it changes the meaning slightly. The reference translation specifies that the Greek language has been affected, while the machine translation only mentions Greek in general.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the omission of the word ""language"" before ""Greek"" in the list of items affected is a notable difference. This omission changes the meaning slightly and could lead to confusion for the reader.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by including the word ""language"" before ""Greek"" in the list.

3. ""fortress urban system"" vs. ""system of fortress cities""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""created"" in the machine translation is less formal than ""established"" in the reference translation. However, both convey the same meaning, so this difference is not significant.
2. The machine translation mentions ""voyages were put in place,"" which is not present in the source or reference translation. This difference is significant because it changes the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation correctly mentions ""voivodes were appointed,"" which is more relevant to the context.
3. The machine translation uses ""fortress urban system,"" which is different from the reference translation's ""system of fortress cities."" Both phrases convey a similar meaning, but the reference translation is more accurate and specific to the context.

Reference translation: The surviving crew members were questioned one by one and were asked how the ship had been handled during the accident.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""intercepted"" vs. ""questioned""
2. ""dealt with"" vs. ""handled""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. ""intercepted"" vs. ""questioned"": The machine translation uses the word ""intercepted"" to describe the process of talking to the surviving crew members. However, the reference translation uses the word ""questioned,"" which is more accurate in this context. The word ""intercepted"" implies that the crew members were stopped or caught, while ""questioned"" implies that they were asked questions.

2. ""dealt with"" vs. ""handled"": The machine translation uses the phrase ""dealt with"" to describe how the ship was managed during the accident, while the reference translation uses the phrase ""handled."" Both phrases convey the same general meaning, but ""handled"" is more commonly used in the context of managing a ship during an accident.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences in word choice that make it less precise than the reference translation. The use of ""intercepted"" instead of ""questioned"" and ""dealt with"" instead of ""handled"" slightly alters the meaning of the sentence.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in phrasing between ""Russian empire's idea"" and ""idea of the Russian empire"" does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both phrases convey the same idea that the concept of the Russian empire as the ""third Rome"" persisted until the 1917 events.
2. The use of ""third Rome"" in both translations is accurate and does not affect the quality of the machine translation.
3. The difference between ""revolutions"" and ""revolution"" is more significant.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Eesti president Kersti Kaljulaid alustas kahepäevast riigivisiiti Soomes, kus ta kohtus Soome presidendi Sauli Niinistöga.
Machine translation: President of Estonia Kersti Kaljuices started a two-day state visit in Finland, where he met Finnish President Sauli Niinistö.
Reference translation: President of Estonia , Kersti Kaljuid , started a two-day state visit to Finland , where she met Finnish President Sauli Niinistö .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, the name ""Kersti Kaljuices"" is incorrect. It should be ""Kersti Kaljulaid.""
2. In the machine translation, the pronoun ""he"" is used, which is incorrect because the subject is female (Kersti Kaljulaid). The reference translation correctly uses ""she.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation has two significant errors: the incorrect name and the incorrect pronoun. These errors affect the accuracy of the translation.

Step 4: Provide a conclusion based on the evaluation.

The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the incorrect name and pronoun. The reference translation is more accurate and should be used instead.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Samas on senided raiemahud jäänud alla optimaalse koguse ning seega peetakse vajalikuks mahtude kasvatamist.
Machine translation: At the same time, current harvests have remained below the optimum amount and therefore it is considered necessary to grow volumes.
Reference translation: At the same time , current cutting volumes have remained below the optimal amount and therefore it is considered necessary to increase the volumes .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""harvests"" while the reference translation uses ""cutting volumes.""
2. The machine translation uses ""grow volumes"" while the reference translation uses ""increase the volumes.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""harvests"" instead of ""cutting volumes"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""harvests"" generally refer to the gathering of crops, while ""cutting volumes"" refer to the amount of material being cut or harvested. This difference in meaning could lead to confusion for the reader.
2. The use of ""grow volumes"" instead of ""increase the volumes"" also changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Grow"" implies a gradual increase, while ""increase"" implies a more immediate and specific action. This difference in meaning could also lead to confusion for the reader.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is not of high quality because it contains significant differences in meaning compared to the reference translation. These differences could lead to confusion for the reader. A higher quality translation would more accurately convey the meaning of the source text and be closer in meaning to the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Frankfurt ei oska seletada, miks armastusel on selline iseväärtus.
Machine translation: Frankfurt cannot explain why love has such self-value.
Reference translation: Frankfurt cannot explain why love has such inherent value.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

In this case, the difference lies in the choice of words ""self-value"" in the machine translation and ""inherent value"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the meaning of the words and their impact on the translation.

""Self-value"" implies that the value of love comes from within itself, while ""inherent value"" implies that the value of love is an integral part of it. Both phrases convey a similar meaning, but ""inherent value"" is more commonly used in this context.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is not entirely incorrect, but it uses a less common phrase that might be confusing for some readers. The reference translation is more accurate and clear in conveying the intended meaning.

Step 5: Provide a final evaluation of the machine translation quality.

The quality of the machine translation is acceptable but could be improved. The choice of words in the machine translation is slightly off, making it less clear than the reference translation. A better choice of words, such as ""inherent value,"" would have made the machine translation more accurate and clear.

Source: Lint kohe Valgesse Majja, sealt siis teatati lõpuks, et paar parteiveterani oli nagu pahameelt avaldanud, et riigivastane jutt, aga tegelikult ei ole.
Machine translation: The ink straight into the White House, then it was reported in the end that a couple of party driers had, as had been resonated, said 'anti-state talk', but there is not actually any anti-state talk.
Reference translation: Lint straight into the White House , then it was reported in the end that a couple of party veterans had been upsed about the ' anti-state talk ' , which actually it was not .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""The ink straight into the White House"" vs. ""Lint straight into the White House"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""lint"" as ""ink,"" while the reference translation correctly translates it as ""lint.""
2. ""then it was reported in the end"" vs. ""then it was reported in the end"": Both translations are the same in this part.
3. ""a couple of party driers"" vs. ""a couple of party veterans"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""veterani"" as ""driers,"" while the reference translation correctly translates it as ""veterans.""
4. ""as had been resonated"" vs. ""which actually it was not"": The machine translation uses ""resonated"" instead of ""resonated"" and ""actually it was not"" instead of ""which actually it was not.""
5. ""said 'anti-state talk'"" vs. ""had been upsed about the 'anti-state talk'"": The machine translation uses ""said"" while the reference translation uses ""had been upsed about.""
6. ""but there is not actually any anti-state talk"" vs. ""which actually it was not"": The machine translation repeats the phrase ""not actually any anti-state talk,"" while the reference translation uses ""which actually it was not.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has several inaccuracies and inconsistencies compared to the reference translation. The translation of ""lint"" as ""ink"" and ""veterani"" as ""driers"" are significant errors that change the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, the repetition of ""not actually any anti-state talk"" and the use of ""resonated"" instead of ""resonated"" detract from the overall quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor, as it contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies compared to the reference translation.

Machine translation: This act was also thrown out during the NSV, and the critics and censors at that time did not find that the content of the work could be anti-moral.
Reference translation: This work was also published during the USSR period , and the critics and censors at that time did not find that the content of the work could be anti-moral .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""This act"" vs. ""This work"": The source text mentions ""teos"" (work), but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""act.""
2. ""thrown out"" vs. ""published"": The source text mentions ""lasti välja"" (published), but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""thrown out.""
3. ""NSV Liidu ajal"" vs. ""USSR period"": The source text mentions ""NSV Liidu ajal"" (during the NSV period), but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""USSR period.""

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has three significant errors compared to the reference translation:

1. It incorrectly translates ""teos"" as ""act"" instead of ""work.""
2. It incorrectly translates ""lasti välja"" as ""thrown out"" instead of ""published.""
3. It incorrectly translates ""NSV Liidu ajal"" as ""USSR period"" instead of ""during the NSV period.""

These errors result in a translation that is not accurate and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The quality of the machine translation is poor, as it contains multiple errors that change the meaning of the source text. The translation does not accurately convey the information from the source text, and the errors make it difficult to understand the intended meaning.

Step 2: Identify the key differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""images"" while the reference translation mentions ""snail shells.""
2. The machine translation does not specify what ""this"" refers to, while the reference translation specifies that ""this"" refers to the fact that the snail shells were found close to the fossils.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

1. The machine translation is less specific than the reference translation, as it does not mention ""snail shells"" but rather ""images."" This makes the machine translation less informative and potentially confusing for the reader.
2. The machine translation does not provide enough context for the reader to understand what ""this"" refers to, which may lead to misunderstandings.

Step 4: Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation. The machine translation is less specific and lacks the necessary context to convey the meaning of the source text accurately.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Afganistani pealinnas Kabulis ründasid arstideks riietunud relvastatud isikud Ameerika Ühendriikide saatkonna lähedal asuvat sõjaväehaiglat.
Machine translation: In Kabul, the Afghan capital, Kabul, armed personnel who were ripped up as doctors attacked a military hospital near the US embassy.
Reference translation: In Kabul , the Afghan capital , armed personnel who were dressed up as doctors attacked a military hospital near the US embassy .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation has an extra ""Kabul, the Afghan capital,"" which is not present in the reference translation.
2. The machine translation uses ""ripped up"" while the reference translation uses ""dressed up"" to describe the armed personnel disguised as doctors.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences on the quality of the machine translation.

1. The extra ""Kabul, the Afghan capital,"" is redundant and does not add any new information. It does not affect the overall quality of the translation.
2. The use of ""ripped up"" instead of ""dressed up"" changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Ripped up"" implies that the armed personnel were physically torn apart, while ""dressed up"" implies that they were wearing doctor's clothing. This difference in meaning could affect the overall quality of the translation.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is moderate. While there are some differences between the machine translation and the reference translation, the meaning of the sentence is still mostly preserved. However, the use of ""ripped up"" instead of ""dressed up"" could lead to confusion for the reader.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: The prize to the defenders of the line was so great that it did not even talk about proper intelligence patrols.
Reference translation: The respect for the defenders of the line was so great that it even prevented proper reconnaissance with intelligence patrols.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""prize"" vs. ""respect""
2. ""did not even talk about"" vs. ""even prevented""
3. ""proper intelligence patrols"" vs. ""proper reconnaissance with intelligence patrols""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The word ""prize"" in the machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of ""aukartus"" in the source text, which is more about respect or admiration.
2. The phrase ""did not even talk about"" in the machine translation is less clear than ""even prevented"" in the reference translation, as it does not convey the idea that the great respect for the defenders of the line hindered proper reconnaissance.
3. The machine translation omits the word ""reconnaissance,"" which is important for understanding the context of the sentence. The phrase ""proper intelligence patrols"" in the machine translation is less specific than ""proper reconnaissance with intelligence patrols"" in the reference translation.

Machine translation: It is only by ignoring the imperatives of moral law that we cannot choose freely.
Reference translation: It is only the ignoring of the imperatives of moral law that we cannot choose freely.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the placement of the word ""only."" In the machine translation, ""only"" is placed before ""by ignoring,"" while in the reference translation, ""only"" is placed before ""the ignoring.""

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the differences on the meaning of the translations.

The placement of ""only"" in the machine translation slightly changes the meaning of the sentence. In the reference translation, the focus is on the act of ignoring the imperatives of moral law, while in the machine translation, the focus is on the process of choosing freely by ignoring the imperatives of moral law.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. The placement of ""only"" in the machine translation changes the emphasis of the sentence, which may lead to a slightly different understanding of the message.

Step 5: Provide a conclusion based on the evaluation.

The quality of the Estonian-English machine translation is not high. The translation is not entirely accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text due to the placement of ""only"" in the sentence.

Machine translation: On the morning of 28 July, the thirty attacks on the protection of the Grenaderfist in the eastern camera had been carried out by 450 men from 47 rhysiements I.
Reference translation: On the morning of 28 July , of the 450 men of the 1st battalion of the 47th regiment who had gone on the attack , only 30 were still defending the eastern trench of the Grenadier Hill .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""the thirty attacks on the protection of the Grenaderfist"" while the reference translation mentions ""the 450 men of the 1st battalion of the 47th regiment who had gone on the attack"".
2. The machine translation mentions ""the eastern camera"" while the reference translation mentions ""the eastern trench of the Grenadier Hill"".
3. The machine translation mentions ""47 rhysiements I"" while the reference translation mentions ""47th regiment"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation incorrectly interprets the source text as referring to ""the thirty attacks"" instead of the 450 men who went on the attack. This leads to confusion and a lack of clarity in the translation.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""idakaevikus kaitsel"" as ""on the protection of the Grenaderfist"" instead of ""still defending the eastern trench of the Grenadier Hill"". This leads to a lack of clarity in the translation.
3. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""rünnakule asunud"" as ""had been carried out by"" instead of ""who had gone on the attack"". This leads to a lack of clarity in the translation.
4. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""rügemendi I pataljonist"" as ""47 rhysiements I"" instead of ""47th regiment"". This leads to a lack of clarity in the translation.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor due to multiple inaccuracies and a lack of clarity. The reference translation provides a more accurate and clear translation of the source text.

Machine translation: In Yemen, a seven-day ceasefire came into force between the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the Shi'ite rebels.
Reference translation: In Yemen , a seven-day ceasefire came into force between the military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and Shiite rebels .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation has the word ""Shi'ite"" while the reference translation has ""Shiite"" (with a lowercase 'i').
2. The machine translation has the word ""rebel"" while the reference translation has ""rebels"" (plural).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The difference in the spelling of ""Shi'ite"" vs. ""Shiite"" is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation. The meaning of the word remains the same in both translations.
2. The difference in the use of ""rebel"" vs. ""rebels"" is also a minor issue. The machine translation could be interpreted as referring to a single rebel, while the reference translation refers to multiple rebels. However, the overall meaning of the sentence is still clear in both translations.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Overall, the machine translation is of high quality. The differences identified are minor and do not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation. The machine translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source text and is very close to the reference translation.

Machine translation: If we are in this situation, we would be happy with this, but not looking ahead.
Reference translation: If we were in this situation , we would be happy with this , but not if we 'd be looking ahead .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""we are"" while the reference translation uses ""we were.""
2. The machine translation omits the phrase ""but not if we 'd be looking ahead"" from the source text.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""we are"" instead of ""we were"" changes the tense of the sentence, making it less accurate than the reference translation.
2. The omission of the phrase ""but not if we 'd be looking ahead"" from the source text results in a less complete translation, as it does not convey the full meaning of the source text.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation due to the changes in tense and the omission of a key phrase from the source text. The reference translation more accurately conveys the meaning of the source text.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. The use of ""must be attributed"" instead of ""refer to"" changes the meaning slightly, making it sound like the attention and active valuation are directly attributed to the value of philosophers, rather than being a topic they discuss. Additionally, the machine translation's phrasing ""to the value of most philosophers"" is less clear than the reference translation's ""to the attribution of value.""

Step 4: Provide a final evaluation of the machine translation.

Machine translation: The Public Prosecutor's Office offered Kender a choice, or an agreement procedure.
Reference translation: The Public Prosecutor 's Office offered Kender an opportunity , that is , a compromise procedure .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""a choice"" while the reference translation uses ""an opportunity.""
2. The machine translation uses ""or"" to separate the two options, while the reference translation uses a comma and ""that is"" to connect the two options.
3. The machine translation uses ""an agreement procedure"" while the reference translation uses ""a compromise procedure.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""a choice"" in the machine translation is less specific than ""an opportunity"" in the reference translation. The reference translation better conveys the idea that the Public Prosecutor's Office is offering Kender a chance to make a decision.
2. The use of ""or"" in the machine translation is more casual and less precise than the use of a comma and ""that is"" in the reference translation. The reference translation provides a smoother and more formal connection between the two options.
3. The use of ""an agreement procedure"" in the machine translation is less accurate than ""a compromise procedure"" in the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the idea that the procedure is a negotiated resolution between the parties involved.

595	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Paavst suudles 14. mail 1999 koraani ja külastas 6. mail 2001 mošeed.
Machine translation: On 14 May 1999 the Pope was able to visit the Koran and visited mosques on 6 May 2001.
Reference translation: On 14 May 1999 the Pope kissed the Quran and visited a mosque on 6 May 2001.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""kissed"" vs. ""was able to visit""
2. ""Quran"" vs. ""Koran""
3. ""mosque"" vs. ""mosques""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The verb ""kissed"" in the reference translation conveys a more specific action than ""was able to visit"" in the machine translation. The machine translation implies that the Pope simply visited the Koran, while the reference translation specifies that he kissed it.
2. The reference translation uses ""Quran,"" which is the more commonly used term in English, while the machine translation uses ""Koran,"" which is the term used in the source text. Both terms refer to the same religious text.
3. The reference translation uses ""mosque"" (singular), while the machine translation uses ""mosques"" (plural). The source text uses ""mošeed,"" which is the Estonian word for ""mosque."" Since the Pope visited only one mosque on 6 May 2001, the reference translation is more accurate in this case.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it does not convey the specific action of the Pope kissing the Quran and uses the plural form for ""mosque."" However, it does capture the general idea of the source text, which is that the Pope visited the Quran on 14 May 1999 and visited mosques on 6 May 2001.

2. The machine translation does not include the comma after ""NATO"" while the reference translation does.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""released"" instead of ""dismissed"" changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Released"" implies that the Special Representative was set free or allowed to leave, while ""dismissed"" implies that the Special Representative was removed from their position. The reference translation accurately captures the intended meaning of the source.
2. The comma in the reference translation is important for clarity. It separates the position of the Special Representative from the person's name, making it easier to understand. The machine translation's omission of the comma makes the sentence less clear.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""emotion"" is singular, while in the reference translation, ""emotions"" is plural.
2. In the machine translation, ""Kant's pathological love"" is used, while in the reference translation, ""Kant as pathological love"" is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the use of ""emotion"" vs. ""emotions"" is a minor issue, as both convey the same general idea. However, the reference translation is more accurate in this case, as Leibniz was considering emotions in general, not just a single emotion.
2. The difference in the phrase ""Kant's pathological love"" vs. ""Kant as pathological love"" is more significant.

Reference translation: The first to congratulate him is the rural municipality mayor , Raivo Tiik , whose wife is in the same hospital , only for prophylactic reasons .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""His first congratulations go out to the Chief Raivo Tiik,"" while the reference translation uses ""The first to congratulate him is the rural municipality mayor , Raivo Tiik,"". The machine translation omits the word ""rural municipality mayor"" and adds the word ""Chief"" which is not present in the source text.
2. The machine translation uses ""whose wife is in the same hospital,"" while the reference translation uses ""whose wife is in the same hospital , only for prophylactic reasons."" The machine translation omits the phrase ""only for prophylactic reasons"" which is present in the source text.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is not an accurate representation of the source text. It omits important information and adds unnecessary words. The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the source text.

Quality evaluation: The machine translation is of low quality because it does not accurately represent the source text and omits important information. The reference translation is of high quality because it is a more accurate representation of the source text.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Temalt sai Rebane teada, et diviisiülem Franz Augsberger on langenud ja temale kui vanemale rügemendiülemale on diviisi juhtimine üle antud.
Machine translation: She learned from her that the dividends, Franz Augsberger, have fallen and has been handed over to her mother as the chief of rhythm.
Reference translation: Rebane learned from him that division commander Franz Augsberger has fallen and the command of the division has been transferred to him as the senior regiment commander.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation refers to ""dividends"" while the source and reference translation refer to ""division commander.""
2. The machine translation mentions ""her mother as the chief of rhythm"" while the source and reference translation mention ""him as the senior regiment commander.""
3. The machine translation uses ""her"" and ""she"" while the source and reference translation use ""him.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""diviisiülem"" (division commander) as ""dividends."" This is a significant error that changes the meaning of the sentence.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""temale kui vanemale rügemendiülemale"" (to him as the senior regiment commander) as ""her mother as the chief of rhythm."" This is another significant error that changes the meaning of the sentence.
3. The machine translation incorrectly assumes that ""Rebane"" is female and uses ""her"" and ""she"" instead of ""him."" This is a minor error that does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation has several significant errors that change the meaning of the source text. The translation of ""diviisiülem"" as ""dividends"" and ""temale kui vanemale rügemendiülemale"" as ""her mother as the chief of rhythm"" are particularly problematic.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""meeting preferences"" vs. ""satisfaction of preferences""
2. ""is also being put into question"" vs. ""can also be put into question""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

Reference translation: The remaining 2 % included all the other ethnic groups , among which , in turn , the largest groups were of European origin , as well as Chinese and the Arabs .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""absorbed"" while the reference translation uses ""included.""
2. The machine translation uses ""nations"" while the reference translation uses ""ethnic groups.""
3. The machine translation uses ""among which the largest groups of European origin, the Chinese and the Arabs make up their own"" while the reference translation uses ""among which , in turn , the largest groups were of European origin , as well as Chinese and the Arabs.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. ""Absorbed"" and ""included"" are synonyms in this context, so this difference does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.
2. ""Nations"" and ""ethnic groups"" are also synonyms in this context, so this difference does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.
3. The machine translation's phrasing is less clear than the reference translation. The reference translation uses ""in turn"" to indicate that the largest groups were of European origin, while the machine translation's phrasing could be interpreted as the Chinese and Arabs making up their own groups.

Machine translation: However, the Godel theorisation shows that arithmetic cannot be just a series of definitions and conclusions.
Reference translation: However , the Gödel theorem shows that arithmetic cannot be just a set of definitions and conclusions .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Godel theorisation"" while the reference translation uses ""Gödel theorem"".
2. The machine translation uses ""a series of definitions and conclusions"" while the reference translation uses ""a set of definitions and conclusions"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The difference in the name (""Godel theorisation"" vs. ""Gödel theorem"") is likely due to a typo or incorrect capitalization in the machine translation. The correct term is ""Gödel theorem"", as used in the reference translation.
2. The difference in the phrase (""a series of definitions and conclusions"" vs. ""a set of definitions and conclusions"") is more significant. The machine translation uses ""series"" while the reference translation uses ""set"". These words have different meanings: ""series"" implies a sequence or order, while ""set"" implies a collection or group. In this context, ""set"" is more appropriate, as it accurately reflects the idea that arithmetic is a collection of definitions and conclusions, not necessarily a sequence.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has some issues, such as the incorrect capitalization of ""Gödel"" and the use of ""series"" instead of ""set"". However, the overall meaning is still understandable and conveys the main idea of the source text.

Machine translation: In Tallinn in Nokia, the Estonian Muusikaum Awards were held in 2012.
Reference translation: In Tallinn in Nokia Concert Hall , the gala of the 2012 Estonian Music Awards was held .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation omits the word ""Concert Hall"" from the venue description.
2. The machine translation uses ""Muusikaum Awards"" instead of ""Muusikaauhindade gala"" and ""Muusika Awards"" in the reference translation.
3. The machine translation uses ""the Estonian Muusikaum Awards"" instead of ""the gala of the 2012 Estonian Music Awards.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The omission of ""Concert Hall"" from the venue description is a minor error that does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. The difference in the name of the awards is likely due to a misunderstanding of the original text. The correct name should be ""Eesti Muusikaauhindade gala"" or ""Estonian Music Awards Gala.""
3. The machine translation's phrasing is less clear than the reference translation, as it does not explicitly state that the event was a gala.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor errors and is less clear than the reference translation. The overall quality of the machine translation is fair, but it could be improved by addressing the mentioned issues.

Machine translation: A contract of bail-in is a lasting agreement, but a one-off contract can also be signed for the provision of a one-off service.
Reference translation: Generally , a service contract is a lasting agreement , but a service contract can also be signed for the provision of a one-off service .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses the term ""bail-in"" while the reference translation uses the term ""service contract.""
2. The machine translation uses the term ""one-off contract"" while the reference translation uses the term ""one-off service.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The term ""bail-in"" is not a correct translation for ""käsundusleping"" (service contract) in this context. The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the meaning of the source text.
2. The term ""one-off contract"" is a more accurate translation for ""ühekordseks teenuse osutamiseks"" (for the provision of a one-off service) than ""one-off service."" However, the machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The quality of the machine translation is low. It does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text due to incorrect translations and misunderstandings. The reference translation is a better representation of the source text's meaning.

Machine translation: The representatives of Minsk's culture were mostly traders who were trading with overseas countries.
Reference translation: The representatives of Minoan culture were mostly traders who were trading with overseas countries.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

In the machine translation, the word ""Minsk's"" is used, while in the reference translation, the word ""Minoan"" is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of the word ""Minsk's"" instead of ""Minoan."" Minsk is the capital of Belarus, while Minoan refers to the Minoan civilization, which was an ancient civilization on the island of Crete. The reference translation is correct, as it refers to the Minoan culture, not Minsk's culture.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate because it incorrectly refers to Minsk's culture instead of the Minoan culture. The reference translation is more accurate and should be used as the correct translation. The quality of the machine translation is poor.

Machine translation: My pain, or some other of my spirituality, can only be seen by myself and I am directly aware of this.
Reference translation: My pain , or some of my other mental states , can only be observed by myself and I am directly aware of this .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""My pain"" is the same in both translations.
2. ""or some other of my spirituality"" (machine translation) vs. ""or some of my other mental states"" (reference translation): The machine translation uses ""spirituality"" while the reference translation uses ""mental states.""
3. ""can only be seen by myself"" is the same in both translations.
4. ""and I am directly aware of this"" is the same in both translations.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of ""spirituality"" vs. ""mental states."" The reference translation is more accurate in this context, as ""spirituality"" is a broader term that does not specifically refer to mental states or conditions. The machine translation's use of ""spirituality"" could lead to confusion for the reader.

Additionally, the machine translation does not include the phrase ""sellest vahetult teadlik"" from the source, which means ""I am directly aware of this."" This omission results in a less accurate translation.

Reference translation: Munich Security Policy Conference , which focused on the theme of "" Global Crisis , Global Commitments . ""

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation has capitalized the first letter of ""Munich,"" while the reference translation has not.
2. The machine translation has removed the space between ""Global Crisis"" and ""Global Commitments,"" while the reference translation has kept the space.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. Capitalization of ""Munich"" does not significantly impact the quality of the translation, as it is a proper noun and can be capitalized or not depending on the style guide. However, it is more common to see proper nouns capitalized in English, so the reference translation is slightly more accurate in this regard.
2. The removal of the space between ""Global Crisis"" and ""Global Commitments"" in the machine translation is a minor error that does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation. It is a stylistic choice and does not change the meaning of the text.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate and only has minor differences from the reference translation. The quality of the translation is good, but there is room for improvement in terms of capitalization and stylistic choices.

Reference translation: Research into Aristotelian categories is also part of metaphysics , as far as the things they contain are studied as existing .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Aristotle categories"" while the reference translation uses ""Aristotelian categories.""
2. The machine translation uses ""metaphysical activity"" while the reference translation uses ""metaphysics.""
3. The machine translation uses ""as they are"" while the reference translation uses ""as existing.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""Aristotle categories"" instead of ""Aristotelian categories"" is a minor difference and does not significantly impact the meaning. However, the reference translation is more accurate in using the adjective ""Aristotelian"" to describe the categories.
2. The use of ""metaphysical activity"" instead of ""metaphysics"" is a more significant difference. ""Metaphysical activity"" implies a more active process, while ""metaphysics"" is a more general term for the branch of philosophy. This difference changes the meaning slightly, making the machine translation less accurate.
3. The use of ""as they are"" instead of ""as existing"" is another minor difference. Both phrases convey the idea that the things contained within the categories are studied in their current state.

Machine translation: The godword and the athee in front of Mr Peetrus and Mr Paulus are presenting their views and letting them teach themselves about the truth of God.
Reference translation: They present their positions in front of the Word of God and the Apostles Peter and Paul and let them teach them about the divine truth.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""godword"" vs. ""Word of God"": The machine translation uses ""godword"" which is not a correct term in English. The reference translation uses ""Word of God,"" which is a more accurate and common phrase.
2. ""athee"" vs. ""apostles Peter and Paul"": The machine translation uses ""athee,"" which is not a correct term in English and does not make sense in this context. The reference translation uses ""apostles Peter and Paul,"" which is accurate and appropriate.
3. ""in front of Mr Peetrus and Mr Paulus"" vs. ""in front of the Word of God"": The machine translation uses ""in front of Mr Peetrus and Mr Paulus,"" which is incorrect because the source text refers to the Apostles Peter and Paul, not Mr. Peetrus and Mr. Paulus.

4. ""presenting their views"" vs. ""presenting their positions"": The machine translation uses ""presenting their views,"" while the reference translation uses ""presenting their positions."" Both are accurate, but the reference translation is more specific and closer to the original source text.
5. ""letting them teach themselves"" vs. ""let them teach them"": The machine translation uses ""letting them teach themselves,"" which implies that the individuals are teaching themselves, while the reference translation uses ""let them teach them,"" which implies that the Apostles Peter and Paul are teaching them.

- The machine translation uses the word ""travellers"" while the reference translation uses the word ""crusaders.""
- The machine translation does not use the word ""at"" before ""Constantinople.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The word ""travellers"" is a more general term, while ""crusaders"" is a specific term referring to the participants in the crusades. The reference translation is more accurate in this context, as it specifies the type of people who arrived in Constantinople.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Võtetel sai ta tuttavaks Quincy Jonesiga, kes tegeles filmi muusikalise poolega.
Machine translation: The winners became familiar with Qucy Jong, who dealt with the film's music side.
Reference translation: At the shoot , he met Quincy Jones who was responsible for the musical side of the film .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""The winners became familiar with Qucy Jong"" vs. ""he met Quincy Jones"" - The machine translation incorrectly refers to the subject as ""winners"" instead of the singular ""he.""
2. ""Qucy Jong"" vs. ""Quincy Jones"" - The machine translation misspells the name of the person.
3. ""who dealt with the film's music side"" vs. ""who was responsible for the musical side of the film"" - The machine translation uses ""dealt with"" while the reference translation uses ""responsible for,"" which is a more accurate description of Quincy Jones' role.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation has several inaccuracies, including the incorrect subject, misspelled name, and less accurate description of Quincy Jones' role. These inaccuracies affect the overall quality of the translation.

Source: Kolmikpunkti Rwanda ja Tansaaniaga määravad Mwibu ja Kagera jõe voolunõvad.
Machine translation: The three points with Rwanda and Tanzania will be determined by the flows of the Mwibu and the Kagera River.
Reference translation: The triple point with Rwanda and Tanzania is determined by the flow beds of the Mwibu and the Kagera rivers.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""three points"" while the reference translation uses ""triple point.""
2. The machine translation uses ""flows"" while the reference translation uses ""flow beds.""
3. The machine translation uses ""with Rwanda and Tanzania"" while the reference translation uses ""with Rwanda and Tanzania.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the description of the geographical feature (three points vs. triple point) is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall meaning.
2. The difference in the description of the river (flows vs. flow beds) is more significant. The reference translation specifies the flow beds of the rivers, which is more precise and accurate. The machine translation's use of ""flows"" is less specific and could be interpreted differently.
3. The difference in the preposition used (with vs. is determined by) is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall meaning.

2. In the machine translation, ""Deputy State Secretary"" is used instead of ""Deputy Secretary-General"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The name ""Nos Ross"" is incorrect. The correct name is ""Märten Ross."" This is a significant error, as names are important for accurate communication.
2. The title ""Deputy State Secretary"" is not the same as ""Deputy Secretary-General."" While both titles indicate a high-ranking position within a ministry, ""Deputy Secretary-General"" is more accurate for the position of ""asekantsler"" in the source text. This is a minor error, but it still affects the quality of the translation.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation has some errors in comparison to the reference translation. The name ""Nos Ross"" is incorrect, and the title ""Deputy State Secretary"" is not the same as ""Deputy Secretary-General."" These errors affect the overall quality of the translation.

Machine translation: Annemary and Riga both consider that the ever decreasing workforce will no longer be able to cope with the new winter.
Reference translation: Annemai and Riks both consider that the ever decreasing workforce at Uuevariku Farm can no longer cope.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""Annemary"" instead of ""Annemai"" from the source.
2. The machine translation mentions ""Riga"" instead of ""Riks"" from the source.
3. The machine translation mentions ""the new winter"" instead of ""Uuevariku Farm"" from the source.
4. The machine translation does not include the phrase ""at Uuevariku Farm"" which is present in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The name ""Annemary"" is likely a typo in the machine translation, as it should be ""Annemai"" based on the source.
2. The name ""Riga"" is likely a typo in the machine translation, as it should be ""Riks"" based on the source.
3. The mention of ""the new winter"" in the machine translation is not accurate, as the source specifically refers to ""Uuevariku talus"" (Uuevariku Farm).

Reference translation: It is easy to understand why a lover wants to give everything to the loved one , or at least wants to choose a pattern of behaviour that is recognisably close to the ideal but less demanding .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""loving person"" vs. ""lover"": The machine translation uses ""loving person"" while the reference translation uses ""lover."" Although both phrases convey a similar meaning, ""lover"" is more specific and appropriate in this context.
2. ""give everyone loved"" vs. ""give everything to the loved one"": The machine translation uses ""give everyone loved,"" which is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense. The reference translation uses ""give everything to the loved one,"" which is more appropriate and clear.
3. ""culture of behaviour"" vs. ""pattern of behaviour"": The machine translation uses ""culture of behaviour,"" while the reference translation uses ""pattern of behaviour."" Both phrases convey a similar meaning, but ""pattern of behaviour"" is more appropriate in this context.
4. ""recognisably close to the ideal but less demanding"" vs. ""recognisably close to the ideal but less demanding"": Both translations are the same in this part, so there is no difference.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

The machine translation has some issues, such as using ""loving person"" instead of ""lover"" and ""give everyone loved"" instead of ""give everything to the loved one."" These inaccuracies affect the overall quality of the translation.

Machine translation: Officials began to pay a higher salary to reduce the temptation of bribery.
Reference translation: Officials began to receive a higher salary to reduce the temptation of bribery.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

In the machine translation, the verb used is ""pay,"" while in the reference translation, the verb used is ""receive.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is minor, and it does not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence. Both translations convey the same idea that officials started to give themselves a higher salary to reduce the temptation of bribery.

2. The machine translation uses ""her reason"" while the reference translation uses ""their reason.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""discriminatory"" instead of ""discriminating party"" is a minor difference and does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. However, ""discriminating party"" is more specific and accurate in this context.
2. The use of ""her reason"" instead of ""their reason"" is a more significant difference. The source text uses the Estonian pronoun ""tema,"" which can refer to either a male or female. In this case, the reference translation correctly uses ""their"" to reflect the ambiguity of the source text. The machine translation incorrectly assumes that the subject is female, which may lead to a misunderstanding of the meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has two minor issues: the use of ""discriminatory"" instead of ""discriminating party"" and the use of ""her reason"" instead of ""their reason.""

3. The machine translation uses ""cultivated"" while the reference translation uses ""cultivated.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the translation of ""Eksplitsiitne valik"" as ""Expulsion options"" and ""Explicit choice"" is due to the fact that the original Estonian word ""eksplitsiitne"" can be translated as either ""expulsion"" or ""explicit."" The reference translation chose ""Explicit choice,"" which is a more accurate translation in this context. The machine translation's choice of ""Expulsion options"" is not incorrect, but it is less accurate.
2. The difference in the translation of ""ei tundu enam nii tähtis"" as ""no longer appear to be so important"" and ""no longer appears to be so important"" is a minor grammatical difference. Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation is more grammatically accurate.
3. The difference in the translation of ""kultiveerida"" as ""cultivated"" is a minor difference in word choice. Both translations convey the same meaning, and the machine translation's choice of ""cultivated"" is not incorrect.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences in word choice and grammar that make it slightly less accurate than the reference translation. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by making more accurate word choices and maintaining consistent grammar.

Machine translation: But honour, practical wisdom and enjoyment as benefits are different and different.
Reference translation: But honour , practical wisdom and enjoyment as logoses of benefits are different and variable .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation omits the word ""logoses"" from the source text.
2. The machine translation has a repetition of the word ""different"" in the second part of the sentence, while the reference translation has the word ""variable.""

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences on the quality of the translation.

1. Omitting the word ""logoses"" from the source text results in a loss of meaning. In the context of the sentence, ""logoses"" refers to ""logoi"" (Greek for ""words"" or ""concepts""), which are used to describe the benefits mentioned. The machine translation does not convey this meaning, which affects the overall quality of the translation.
2. The repetition of the word ""different"" in the machine translation makes the sentence sound awkward and less natural. The use of the word ""variable"" in the reference translation is more appropriate and conveys the intended meaning more accurately.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has some issues with accuracy and naturalness due to the omission of the word ""logoses"" and the repetition of the word ""different."" The reference translation is more accurate and conveys the intended meaning more effectively. Therefore, the overall quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in two main aspects:

1. The verb ""recognising"" vs. ""confessing"": The source uses the verb ""tunnistamise"" (recognising), while the reference translation uses ""confessing."" The machine translation correctly captures the meaning of ""tunnistamise"" as ""recognising.""

Reference translation: Estonia was visited by Victoria Nuland , Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United States , who met with Urmas Paet , Estonian Foreign Minister .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, the name ""Urmas Paedi"" is used, while in the reference translation, the name ""Urmas Paet"" is used.
2. In the machine translation, the word ""with"" is not used before ""Urmas Paedi,"" while it is used in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the name could be due to a typo or a minor error in the machine translation. It is important to verify the correct spelling of the name to ensure accuracy.
2. The omission of the word ""with"" in the machine translation does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence, but it does make the sentence slightly less formal.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. However, there are minor differences in the spelling of a name and the use of a formal word. The quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by correcting the spelling of the name and adding the word ""with"" for formality.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: Until 1993 the dollar's rate was national fixed, after which the exchange rate has been floating.
Reference translation: Until 1993 the dollar 's rate was fixed by the state , afterwards the exchange rate has been floating .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""national"" while the reference translation uses ""state"" to describe the fixed dollar rate.
2. The machine translation omits the word ""by"" before ""the state"" in the reference translation.
3. The machine translation uses ""after which"" while the reference translation uses ""afterwards"" to describe the time when the exchange rate started floating.

Machine translation: The 2014 edition is a front line for Mary Midgley.
Reference translation: The 2014 edition includes a foreword by Mary Midgley.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- Machine translation: ""The 2014 edition is a front line for Mary Midgley.""
- Reference translation: ""The 2014 edition includes a foreword by Mary Midgley.""

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of the phrase ""a front line"" in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""includes a foreword.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate in this case. The phrase ""a front line"" does not convey the same meaning as ""includes a foreword."" A ""front line"" typically refers to the forefront or leading edge of something, while ""includes a foreword"" means that the edition has a preface or introduction written by Mary Midgley.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The quality of the machine translation is poor, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The machine translation is different from the reference translation in a significant way, which affects the overall understanding of the text.

In conclusion, the quality of the Estonian-English machine translation is poor, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The translation should be revised to better reflect the original meaning.

Source: Finnis ütleb, et kui sõprus ei ole abieluline, siis sõprade suguelundite aktiveerimine ei saa olla nende sõpruse ühise hüve aktualiseerimine.
Machine translation: Finn says that, if friendship is not helpless, the activation of friends' genital mutilation cannot be an accessories to their common good of friendship.
Reference translation: Finnis says that , if friendship is not conjugal , the activation of friends ' genitals cannot be an actualisation of the common good of their friendship .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""if friendship is not helpless"" vs. ""if friendship is not conjugal"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""abieluline"" as ""helpless,"" while the reference translation correctly translates it as ""conjugal.""
2. ""the activation of friends' genital mutilation"" vs. ""the activation of friends' genitals"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""suguelundite"" as ""genital mutilation,"" while the reference translation correctly translates it as ""genitals.""
3. ""cannot be an accessories to their common good of friendship"" vs. ""cannot be an actualisation of the common good of their friendship"": The machine translation incorrectly uses ""accessories"" and ""common good of friendship,"" while the reference translation correctly uses ""actualisation"" and ""common good of their friendship.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has several inaccuracies and misunderstandings of the original text. It incorrectly translates ""abieluline"" as ""helpless,"" ""suguelundite"" as ""genital mutilation,"" and uses incorrect phrasing for the rest of the sentence.

1. The machine translation uses ""consider"" while the reference translation uses ""mean.""
2. The machine translation uses ""commitment"" while the reference translation uses ""duty.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""consider"" in the machine translation is a reasonable translation of the Estonian word ""kohustusega silmas peab,"" which can be understood as ""considering a duty."" However, the reference translation's use of ""mean"" is also a valid translation, as it conveys the idea of Kant's intention or interpretation of the duty.
2. The use of ""commitment"" in the machine translation is not an incorrect translation, but it is less precise than the reference translation's use of ""duty."" ""Commitment"" implies a personal dedication or obligation, while ""duty"" is a more formal and objective term that better captures the philosophical context of Kant's work.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate and captures the overall meaning of the source text.

Machine translation: In Estonia, a preliminary vote on the elections for the National Assembly for 2007 began in land centres and external representations.
Reference translation: In Estonia , a preliminary vote in the 2007 election for the Riigikogu began in county centres and foreign missions .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""National Assembly"" vs. ""Riigikogu""
2. ""land centres"" vs. ""county centres""
3. ""external representations"" vs. ""foreign missions""

Source: Vastutuse rünnaku eest võttis islamiliikumise Ţālebān Pakistani haru.
Machine translation: It was the Pakistani branch of the Islamic movement in Ţālebân who took responsibility for the attack.
Reference translation: It was the Pakistani branch of the Islamic movement in Ţālebân who took responsibility for the attack.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

Upon close examination, there are no differences between the machine translation and the reference translation. Both translations convey the same meaning and are identical in wording.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Since the machine translation is identical to the reference translation, it can be considered a high-quality translation. The machine translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text and is free of errors.

Conclusion: The quality of the Estonian-English translation is high, as the machine translation is identical to the reference translation and accurately conveys the meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

894	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Warnocki järgi oleks inimese olukord ilma eetikata halvem.
Machine translation: According to Warnock, the human situation would be worse without ethics.
Reference translation: According to Warnock , the human condition would be worse without ethics .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""situation"" while the reference translation uses ""condition.""
2. The machine translation omits the comma after ""Warnock.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in word choice between ""situation"" and ""condition"" does not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. Both words can be used to describe the state of being human without ethics. However, ""condition"" is more commonly used in this context, making the reference translation slightly more accurate.
2. The omission of the comma after ""Warnock"" is a minor grammatical error that does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate and only has minor differences from the reference translation. The quality of the machine translation is good, but the reference translation is slightly more accurate due to the choice of the word ""condition"" and the inclusion of the comma.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

895	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Haigeid ei püüta sündmuskohal stabiliseerida, vaid rõhk on sõltumata seisundist kiirel transpordil erakorralise meditsiini osakonda.
Machine translation: It does not seek to stabilise the disease on the ground, but emphasises the emergency medical department, regardless of the condition at high speed of transport.
Reference translation: The patients are not stabilised on site , but the emphasis is on fast transport to the emergency medical department , regardless of the condition .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""the disease"" while the reference translation uses ""the patients."" The source is talking about patients, not the disease itself.
2. The machine translation says ""It does not seek to stabilise the disease on the ground,"" which is not accurate. The source is talking about not stabilising patients on site, not the disease.
3. The machine translation says ""but emphasises the emergency medical department, regardless of the condition at high speed of transport,"" which is not clear and does not accurately convey the meaning of the source.
4. The reference translation says ""The patients are not stabilised on site , but the emphasis is on fast transport to the emergency medical department , regardless of the condition,"" which accurately conveys the meaning of the source.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate and does not convey the meaning of the source correctly. It has some grammatical errors and does not accurately translate the key concepts from the source.

Step 4: Provide a conclusion.

The quality of the Estonian-English machine translation is poor. It does not accurately convey the meaning of the source and has some grammatical errors. The reference translation is a better representation of the source's meaning and should be used instead.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

896	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Estonian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Sellest tulenevalt oli kaitsjatele soodsam, kui intensiivne lõunapäike paistaks neile küljelt.
Machine translation: As a result, it was more advantageous for the protectors to appear from their side on intensive lunch days.
Reference translation: As a result , it was more advantageous for the defenders if the intense midday sun would shine from their side .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""protectors"" while the reference translation uses ""defenders.""
2. The machine translation mentions ""intensive lunch days"" while the reference translation mentions ""intense midday sun.""
3. The machine translation says ""it was more advantageous for the protectors to appear from their side"" while the reference translation says ""it was more advantageous for the defenders if the intense midday sun would shine from their side.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in the choice of words (""protectors"" vs. ""defenders"") does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both words can be used to describe the same group of people.
2. The difference between ""intensive lunch days"" and ""intense midday sun"" is more significant. ""Intensive lunch days"" could be interpreted as days when people have a lot of lunch breaks, while ""intense midday sun"" refers to the strength of the sunlight during the day. The reference translation better captures the original meaning of the source, which is related to the sun shining on the defenders.
3. The machine translation does not fully capture the conditional nature of the original sentence. The reference translation uses ""if"" to indicate that the advantage would be greater if the sun shined from their side, while the machine translation implies that the protectors appeared on intensive lunch days, which is not the same.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of high quality, as it does not accurately capture the meaning of the source text and has some significant differences compared to the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.
