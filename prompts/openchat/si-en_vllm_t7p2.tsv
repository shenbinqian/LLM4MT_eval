Source: හැම දැයෙහි මිදුණා වූ කසුප් බුදුරජුනට නමස්කාර වේ වා.
Machine translation: Every frost is named for the Ksupp Buddha.
Reference translation: Praise be to the Buddha who is saved in all things .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- The machine translation mentions ""Every frost is named for the Ksupp Buddha,"" while the reference translation talks about ""Praise be to the Buddha who is saved in all things.""
- The machine translation seems to focus on the naming of frosts for the Ksupp Buddha, while the reference translation is about praising the Buddha who is saved in all things.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

- The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. It focuses on the naming of frosts for the Ksupp Buddha, which is not mentioned in the source text.
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text, which is about praising the Buddha who is saved in all things.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is a better representation of the source text's meaning.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

- Machine translation: Table of contemporary undertakings is hidden in arithmetic.
- Reference translation: Things that are thus temporarily suppressed are hidden in the awichnaya

Differences:
1. The machine translation mentions ""Table of contemporary undertakings"" while the reference translation mentions ""Things that are thus temporarily suppressed.""
2. The machine translation mentions ""hidden in arithmetic"" while the reference translation mentions ""hidden in the awichnaya.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation inaccurately translates the source text by interpreting ""දේවල් අවිටානය"" (devala avithana) as ""arithmetic."" The reference translation correctly translates it as ""awichnaya,"" which is a more appropriate term in the context.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""මෙසේ තාවකාලිකව යටපත් කරන්නා වූ"" (mesa thawakaliya yatipath karnna va) as ""Table of contemporary undertakings,"" which is not an accurate representation of the source text. The reference translation, ""Things that are thus temporarily suppressed,"" is a more accurate representation of the source text.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor due to inaccurate translations of key terms and phrases. The reference translation is more accurate and better represents the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Source: ගිවිසුම කඩවීම සිදු වූ පාර්ශවයට වන්දි ගෙවිමට සිදුවන අලාභ හානි.
Machine translation: The damage to compensation for the parties that had broken the treaty.
Reference translation: Damage to be paid to the party who breached the agreement.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- Machine translation: The damage to compensation for the parties that had broken the treaty.
- Reference translation: Damage to be paid to the party who breached the agreement.

Differences:
1. The machine translation mentions ""compensation"" while the reference translation mentions ""damage to be paid.""
2. The machine translation refers to ""the parties that had broken the treaty,"" while the reference translation refers to ""the party who breached the agreement.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""compensation"" in the machine translation is not accurate, as the source text does not mention compensation. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of the source text by mentioning ""damage to be paid.""
2. The machine translation incorrectly refers to ""the parties that had broken the treaty,"" while the reference translation correctly refers to ""the party who breached the agreement."" The source text is about the damage to be paid to the party that breached the agreement, not to all parties that broke the treaty.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not accurate and does not correctly capture the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and better represents the meaning of the source text.

Machine translation: There is also a price decision in the market competition in the last 05 years.
Reference translation: Also , in the face of market competition , pricing has taken place over the past five years .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""There is also a price decision"" while the reference translation uses ""Also , in the face of market competition"".
2. The machine translation uses ""in the last 05 years"" while the reference translation uses ""over the past five years"".

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, which is about pricing decisions in market competition.
2. However, the machine translation is less clear and less natural than the reference translation. The phrase ""There is also a price decision"" is not as clear as ""Also , in the face of market competition"".
3. The phrase ""in the last 05 years"" is less accurate than ""over the past five years"" because it implies that the pricing decisions happened only in the last five years, while the reference translation implies that the pricing decisions have been happening over the past five years.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is mostly accurate but lacks clarity and naturalness compared to the reference translation. The differences in phrasing and the less accurate use of ""in the last 05 years"" instead of ""over the past five years"" result in a slightly lower quality translation.

Reference translation: Scholars were in great demand as writers and royal secretaries at this time.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- The machine translation starts with ""As these writers and Royal Secretaries,"" while the reference translation starts with ""Scholars were in great demand.""
- The machine translation mentions ""there was great demand for science,"" while the reference translation mentions ""as writers and royal secretaries at this time.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

- The machine translation incorrectly starts with the subject (writers and Royal Secretaries) instead of the main point (scholars were in great demand).
- The machine translation focuses on the demand for science, which is not the main point of the reference translation.

Machine translation: This is on the border between the southern karma lower karma and the southern karma cosica.
Reference translation: This is located at the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle in the lower atrium of the right atrium.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- Machine translation: ""southern karma lower karma"" and ""southern karma cosica""
- Reference translation: ""right atrium"" and ""left ventricle in the lower atrium of the right atrium""

Step 3: Determine the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate in this case. The source text is referring to a location within the human body, specifically between the right atrium and the left ventricle in the lower atrium of the right atrium. However, the machine translation incorrectly translates ""කර්ණිකාව"" (chamber) as ""karma"" and ""පහළ"" (boundary) as ""cosica,"" which are not related to the human body parts mentioned in the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the Sinhala-English translation.

The quality of the Sinhala-English translation is poor due to the inaccuracies in the translation. The machine translation does not convey the correct meaning of the source text, and the translation is not coherent with the reference translation.

Machine translation: This causes polar bears to be unable to survive the heat of their bodies and they can be killed.
Reference translation: As a result , polar bears are unable to maintain their body temperature and may die .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""survive the heat of their bodies"" while the reference translation uses ""maintain their body temperature.""
2. The machine translation uses ""they can be killed"" while the reference translation uses ""may die.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation captures the general idea of the source text, which is that polar bears are unable to cope with a certain situation and may die as a result.
2. However, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation in terms of conveying the specific meaning of the source text. The reference translation better captures the idea of polar bears being unable to maintain their body temperature.
3. The machine translation uses the phrase ""survive the heat of their bodies,"" which is not an accurate representation of the source text. The source text does not mention heat, but rather refers to a certain situation that polar bears cannot cope with.
4. The machine translation uses the phrase ""they can be killed,"" which is more aggressive than the reference translation's ""may die."" This difference in tone and severity may affect the overall quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate or clear as the reference translation. It captures the general idea of the source text but does not convey the specific meaning as effectively as the reference translation.

Machine translation: A Liao Ceng claimed that their army was made up of 800,000 soldiers.
Reference translation: A Liao general said their army was made up of 800,000 soldiers.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- Machine translation: A Liao Ceng claimed that their army was made up of 800,000 soldiers.
- Reference translation: A Liao general said their army was made up of 800,000 soldiers.

Difference: The machine translation uses ""claimed"" while the reference translation uses ""said.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is minimal and does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both translations convey the same message that a Liao person (either Ceng or general) stated that their army consisted of 800,000 soldiers. The use of ""claimed"" in the machine translation could be interpreted as a more assertive statement, while ""said"" in the reference translation is more neutral. However, this difference does not significantly affect the overall quality of the machine translation.

Conclusion: The quality of the Sinhala-English machine translation is good, with only a minor difference in the choice of words between the machine translation and the reference translation. The overall meaning is preserved, and the translation is accurate.

69	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: යෝර්ක්ෂයර් හිදි එක්කෙනෙකු සහ බර්මින්හැම් හි සෙලිඕර්ක් හීදි එක් කෙනෙකුද වශයෙනි.
Machine translation: One in Yorkshire and one in selioux in Birmingham.
Reference translation: One in Yorkshire and one in Celiork , Birmingham .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation has ""selioux"" while the reference translation has ""Celiork"".
- The machine translation has ""in Birmingham"" while the reference translation has ""Birmingham"" as a separate word.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the word ""selioux"" and ""Celiork"" is likely due to a misunderstanding of the source text. The source text has ""සෙලිඕර්ක් හීදි"" which is likely a misspelling or incorrect transcription of the original word. The reference translation has ""Celiork"" which seems to be a more accurate translation of the source text.
- The difference in the placement of ""in Birmingham"" is a minor formatting issue. Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation separates the location (Birmingham) from the city (Selioux/Celiork) with a comma, which is a more common and clearer way to express the location.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has some issues in accurately translating the source text and formatting. However, it still conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. The quality of the machine translation can be considered as fair, but it could be improved by addressing the differences identified in the analysis.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Reference translation: From then on , miners all over America began to dig wells in search of oil .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- Machine translation: canneries across the United States
- Reference translation: miners all over America

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it mentions ""canneries"" instead of ""miners."" This difference in translation can change the meaning of the sentence, as canneries are related to food processing, not oil exploration. The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text, which is about miners digging wells in search of oil.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The quality of the machine translation is poor because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The translation error changes the subject of the sentence, leading to confusion for the reader.

Reference translation: The body of animals have abundant amounts of fur to adapt to harsh winter.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

In the machine translation, it says ""multiple wools"" while the reference translation says ""abundant amounts of fur."" The key difference here is the use of ""wools"" instead of ""fur"" and ""multiple"" instead of ""abundant amounts.""

Step 3: Determine the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate in this case. The use of ""wools"" instead of ""fur"" is incorrect, as ""wools"" typically refer to the soft, curly hair of sheep, while ""fur"" refers to the thick hair that covers the bodies of many animals. Additionally, ""multiple"" is not the best choice of words to describe the abundance of fur, as it does not convey the same meaning as ""abundant amounts.""

Step 4: Provide a conclusion on the quality of the machine translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: පසුකාලීණ වර්ෂවල සටහන්වල සඳහන් වන්නේ රැජිනක පිළිබඳ පමණි.
Machine translation: The notes of the lateral varieties are mentioned only on a queen.
Reference translation: Records of later years refer only to a queen.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- Machine translation: The notes of the lateral varieties are mentioned only on a queen.
- Reference translation: Records of later years refer only to a queen.

Differences:
1. ""The notes of the lateral varieties"" vs. ""Records of later years""
2. ""are mentioned"" vs. ""refer""
3. ""only on a queen"" vs. ""only to a queen""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. ""The notes of the lateral varieties"" vs. ""Records of later years"": The machine translation is less clear and less accurate than the reference translation. The reference translation uses ""Records of later years,"" which is more concise and accurate.
2. ""are mentioned"" vs. ""refer"": The machine translation uses ""are mentioned,"" which is less accurate than ""refer"" in the reference translation. ""Refer"" is more appropriate in this context, as it indicates that the records are pointing to or discussing a specific subject (a queen).
3. ""only on a queen"" vs. ""only to a queen"": The machine translation uses ""only on a queen,"" which is less accurate than ""only to a queen"" in the reference translation. ""Only to a queen"" is more appropriate in this context, as it indicates that the records are exclusively about a queen, not just mentioning her.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is low. It is less clear, less accurate, and less concise than the reference translation.

Machine translation: This can be due to inhalation or different cutaneous or heart problems.
Reference translation: This can be caused by breathing or different valves or heart problems.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""due to"" vs. ""caused by""
2. ""inhalation"" vs. ""breathing""
3. ""cutaneous"" vs. ""valves""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. ""due to"" and ""caused by"" are synonymous phrases, so this difference does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.
2. ""inhalation"" and ""breathing"" are also synonymous in this context, so this difference does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.
3. ""cutaneous"" refers to the skin, while ""valves"" refer to the heart's flaps that control blood flow. This difference is significant because it changes the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation is more accurate in this regard.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation due to the difference in the meaning of ""cutaneous"" and ""valves."" The machine translation is still understandable, but the reference translation is more accurate.

Machine translation: Akhnaaton and unidentified descent have been suggested to be their parents.
Reference translation: It has been suggested that Aknatan and an unidentified queen may have been their parents.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Akhnaaton"" while the reference translation uses ""Aknatan."" This could be a typo or a difference in transliteration.
2. The machine translation says ""unidentified descent"" while the reference translation says ""an unidentified queen."" The machine translation's phrasing is less clear and could be interpreted differently.
3. The machine translation does not include the word ""may"" which is present in the reference translation. The inclusion of ""may"" in the reference translation makes the statement more tentative and accurate.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation has some differences from the reference translation that affect the clarity and accuracy of the statement. The use of ""Akhnaaton"" instead of ""Aknatan"" could be a typo or a difference in transliteration, but it still creates a difference in the translation. The phrase ""unidentified descent"" is less clear than ""an unidentified queen,"" and the omission of ""may"" makes the statement more definitive than the reference translation.

Based on these differences, the quality of the machine translation is not as high as the reference translation. The machine translation could be improved by using the correct name ""Aknatan,"" clarifying the phrase ""unidentified descent"" as ""an unidentified queen,"" and including the word ""may"" to make the statement more accurate.

Reference translation: In Muslim culture , Muhammad is considered to be the last knower of all things .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""the last prophet who knew everything"" while the reference translation uses ""the last knower of all things.""
2. The machine translation capitalizes ""Muhammad"" while the reference translation does not.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The difference in the description of Muhammad (""the last prophet who knew everything"" vs. ""the last knower of all things"") slightly changes the meaning of the sentence. The machine translation implies that Muhammad knew everything, while the reference translation implies that Muhammad is the last person in the culture who is considered to have this knowledge.
2. The capitalization of ""Muhammad"" in the machine translation is not an issue, as it is a proper noun and should be capitalized.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there is a slight difference in meaning due to the description of Muhammad. The quality of the machine translation is good, but not perfect.

Machine translation: His girlfriend was expected to marry Evan Nash.
Reference translation: He was expecting to marry his girlfriend, Yvonne Nash.

Analysis:
1. The source text mentions ""ඔහුගේ පෙම්වතිය"" (his girlfriend) and ""ඉවෝන් නෑෂ් සමග"" (Yvonne Nash). The machine translation correctly identifies the subject as ""his girlfriend"" but incorrectly translates the name as ""Evan Nash"" instead of ""Yvonne Nash.""
2. The source text mentions ""වීමට අපේක්ෂායෙන් සිටියේය"" (was expecting to marry). The machine translation correctly translates this phrase as ""was expected to marry.""
3. The reference translation mentions ""He was expecting to marry his girlfriend, Yvonne Nash."" This translation is more accurate than the machine translation, as it correctly includes the name ""Yvonne Nash"" and the possessive pronoun ""his.""

Based on this analysis, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The main issue is the incorrect translation of the name ""Yvonne Nash"" as ""Evan Nash."" The machine translation does capture the overall meaning of the source text, but the inaccuracy in the name makes it less accurate than the reference translation.

Machine translation: This book is also the unique essay of Father Jacomé Gonzalves.
Reference translation: This book is also an excellent compilation by Father Jacome Gonzalvez .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- Machine translation: ""unique essay""
- Reference translation: ""excellent compilation""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

- The machine translation uses the term ""unique essay"" to describe the book, while the reference translation uses ""excellent compilation.""
- The source text uses the term ""අද්විතීය රචනාවකි"" (adventure compilation) to describe the book, which is closer in meaning to ""excellent compilation"" in the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

- The machine translation is not entirely accurate in capturing the meaning of the source text.
- The term ""unique essay"" is not the best choice to describe the book, as it does not convey the idea of an ""adventure compilation"" present in the source text.

 To evaluate the quality of the Sinhala-English translation, I will first read and understand the source text, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation to determine the quality of the translation.

Source: මෙයට විරුද්ධ තර්කයන් ඉදිරිපත් කළ 11 වැනි සියවසෙහි විසු දේවධර්මධරයෙකු වන අබු හමීඩ් අල් ගසාලි, අවසානයේදී ජය ගත්තේය.

Machine translation: The opposite arguments to this were presented in the 11th century by a judge, Abu Hamid Al Ghazali, who finally won.

Reference translation: Abu Hameed al-Ghazali, an 11th-century theologian who argued the opposite, eventually won.

Now, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, the name ""Al Ghazali"" is written as ""Al Ghazali,"" while in the reference translation, it is written as ""al-Ghazali."" This is a minor difference in the spelling of the name.
2. The machine translation mentions that Abu Hamid Al Ghazali was a judge, while the reference translation refers to him as a theologian. This is a significant difference in the description of Abu Hamid Al Ghazali's profession.
3. The machine translation states that Abu Hamid Al Ghazali presented ""the opposite arguments,"" while the reference translation says he argued ""the opposite."" This is a slight difference in the way the opposition to the source text is described.

Based on this analysis, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has some differences from the reference translation. The main difference is the description of Abu Hamid Al Ghazali's profession. The machine translation's description of his profession as a judge is not entirely accurate, as the reference translation correctly identifies him as a theologian. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good but could be improved by more accurately describing Abu Hamid Al Ghazali's profession.

2. The machine translation mentions ""mut's landscape"" while the reference translation mentions ""the territory of Mutt"".
3. The machine translation refers to ""the ancient great temple of Egypt"" while the reference translation refers to ""the ancient great goddess of Egypt"".
4. The machine translation mentions ""Carnac"" while the reference translation also mentions ""Carnac"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""replaced"" instead of ""restored"" changes the meaning of the sentence. ""Restored"" implies that the territory was brought back to its original state, while ""replaced"" suggests that something was taken out and replaced with something else.
2. The mention of ""mut's landscape"" instead of ""the territory of Mutt"" changes the focus of the sentence. ""Mut's landscape"" implies a specific area related to the goddess Mut, while ""the territory of Mutt"" implies a larger area associated with the goddess.
3. The reference to ""the ancient great temple of Egypt"" instead of ""the ancient great goddess of Egypt"" changes the subject of the sentence. The source and reference translation are discussing a goddess, while the machine translation is discussing a temple.
4. The mention of ""Carnac"" is consistent between the machine translation and the reference translation, so this part of the translation is accurate.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: පළමු ගල්ෆ් යුද්ධය හේතුවෙන් ඉරාකය සම්පුර්ණයෙන්ම විනාශ විය.
Machine translation: The first gulf war caused Iraq to be completely destroyed.
Reference translation: Iraq was completely destroyed by the First Gulf War.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses the passive voice (""caused Iraq to be completely destroyed""), while the reference translation uses the active voice (""completely destroyed by the First Gulf War"").
2. The machine translation places ""the first gulf war"" before ""caused Iraq to be completely destroyed,"" while the reference translation places ""the First Gulf War"" after ""Iraq was completely destroyed.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some differences from the reference translation. The passive voice used in the machine translation makes the sentence less clear than the active voice used in the reference translation. Additionally, the placement of ""the first gulf war"" in the machine translation is less natural than the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation is of moderate quality. It conveys the main idea of the source text, but it could be improved in terms of clarity and naturalness.

Machine translation: According to history, the kin dynasty is considered a surname of Shang dynasty and is specifically used to refer to the later half of the Shang dynasty.
Reference translation: Historically , the term Yin Dynasty has been synonymous with the Zhang Dynasty , especially used during later half of the dynasty .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation refers to the ""kin dynasty"" while the reference translation refers to the ""Yin Dynasty.""
2. The machine translation states that the kin dynasty is considered a surname of the Shang dynasty, while the reference translation states that the term Yin Dynasty has been synonymous with the Zhang Dynasty.
3. The machine translation specifically mentions the later half of the Shang dynasty, while the reference translation only mentions the later half of the dynasty without specifying which dynasty.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. The translation of ""kin dynasty"" as a surname of the Shang dynasty is not correct, as the source text refers to the Yin Dynasty being synonymous with the Zhang Dynasty.

Machine translation: If there are some philosophical attitudes that fall correctly, it is clear that they were generalized to follow the season as concepts.

Reference translation: Therefore , it is clear that if there were any philosophical attitudes that were perceived to be correct , they were to be considered and followed as concepts of the season .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""If there are some philosophical attitudes that fall correctly"" while the reference translation uses ""Therefore, it is clear that if there were any philosophical attitudes that were perceived to be correct"". The machine translation is less formal and less clear in expressing the idea.

2. The machine translation says ""they were generalized to follow the season as concepts"" while the reference translation says ""they were to be considered and followed as concepts of the season"". The machine translation does not convey the idea of considering and following the concepts of the season as clearly as the reference translation.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

The machine translation is not as clear and accurate as the reference translation. It lacks the formal tone and clarity in expressing the idea. The differences in wording and structure make the machine translation less effective in conveying the meaning of the source text.

Conclusion: The quality of the Sinhala-English machine translation is poor. It does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and lacks clarity and formality.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""was stuck alongside"" while the reference translation uses ""had tilted to a side."" These phrases have different meanings. ""Was stuck alongside"" implies that the aircraft was positioned next to something, while ""had tilted to a side"" implies that the aircraft's position changed.
2. The machine translation focuses on the temperature data being provided by the aircraft, while the reference translation focuses on the aircraft transmitting the temperature data.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is not an accurate representation of the reference translation.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate because the word ""regions"" is not the same as ""provinces"" in this context. The reference translation is more accurate as it uses the correct term ""provinces.""

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the Sinhala-English translation.

The quality of the Sinhala-English translation is not very good. The machine translation is not accurate, and the reference translation is more appropriate. The translation should have used the term ""provinces"" instead of ""regions"" to accurately convey the meaning of the source text.

- Reference translation: ""These were the last of the poor""
- Machine translation: ""barely had enough revenue to survive""
- Reference translation: ""made barely enough to make a living""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate. It has captured the general idea of the source text, but there are some differences in the choice of words and phrasing.

- ""They were the last sparks"" is a less accurate translation of ""මොවුන් අන්තිම දිළින්දන් වූ"" (These were the last of the poor). The word ""sparks"" does not convey the same meaning as ""poor"" in this context.
- ""barely had enough revenue to survive"" is a more accurate translation of ""දිවි ගැට ගසා ගැනීමට තරම් ආදායමක් ලද්දෝ වූහ"" (made barely enough to make a living). However, the phrase ""barely had enough revenue to survive"" is not as close in meaning to ""made barely enough to make a living"" as it could be.

Step 4: Provide a conclusion.

The machine translation is not of high quality. It captures the general idea of the source text but has some inaccuracies in the choice of words and phrasing. The translation could be improved by using more accurate words and phrases to convey the meaning of the source text.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""Min Abbey"" while the reference translation mentions ""the head queen Ming.""
2. The machine translation includes ""including the Japanese government"" while the reference translation says ""by the Japanese government.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

Machine translation: Rather than in western countries, this salad plant is used for various kinds of food taxonomy.
Reference translation: Compared to western countries , this salad plant is used for a variety of dishes .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Rather than in western countries"" while the reference translation uses ""Compared to western countries"". The machine translation implies a stronger contrast between the western countries and the context of the sentence, while the reference translation implies a more subtle comparison.
2. The machine translation mentions ""various kinds of food taxonomy"" while the reference translation mentions ""a variety of dishes"". The machine translation uses a more technical term ""food taxonomy"" which refers to the classification of food items, while the reference translation uses a more general term ""dishes"" which refers to the prepared food items.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The stronger contrast implied by the machine translation is not necessary in this context, and the use of the more technical term ""food taxonomy"" may not be appropriate. The reference translation is more accurate and conveys the intended meaning more effectively.

Machine translation: In 1763 the appointed royal announcement of the western colonies of the Appalachian Mountains was temporarily suspended.
Reference translation: A royal proclamation issued in 1763 temporarily prohibited the establishment of western settlements in the Appalachian Mountains.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""the appointed royal announcement"" while the reference translation uses ""a royal proclamation.""
2. The machine translation says ""the western colonies of the Appalachian Mountains"" while the reference translation says ""western settlements in the Appalachian Mountains.""
3. The machine translation says ""was temporarily suspended"" while the reference translation says ""temporarily prohibited.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""a royal proclamation"" in the reference translation is more accurate than ""the appointed royal announcement"" in the machine translation, as a proclamation is a more specific term for a formal announcement made by a ruler.
2. The phrase ""western settlements in the Appalachian Mountains"" in the reference translation is more accurate than ""the western colonies of the Appalachian Mountains"" in the machine translation, as ""settlements"" refers to the establishment of communities, while ""colonies"" refers to territories under the control of a foreign power.
3. The phrase ""temporarily prohibited"" in the reference translation is more accurate than ""temporarily suspended"" in the machine translation, as ""prohibited"" specifically refers to the act of forbidding something, while ""suspended"" implies a temporary halt or interruption.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation more accurately conveys the meaning of the source text by using more specific terms and phrases.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- Machine translation: A range of advanced individuals who have been welcomed for their contributions have missed this.
- Reference translation: Many of the elite who were thus recognized for their contributions have thus missed out.

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""advanced individuals"" while the reference translation uses ""elite.""

3. The machine translation uses ""missed this"" while the reference translation uses ""missed out.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. ""Advanced individuals"" vs. ""elite"": The term ""elite"" is more appropriate in this context, as it refers to a select group of people who have achieved a high status or recognition. ""Advanced individuals"" is a more general term and does not convey the same meaning.
2. ""Welcomed for their contributions"" vs. ""recognized for their contributions"": The reference translation more accurately captures the idea that these individuals were acknowledged for their contributions. ""Welcomed"" implies a more general acceptance, while ""recognized"" implies a specific acknowledgment of their contributions.
3. ""Missed this"" vs. ""missed out"": The reference translation's use of ""missed out"" is more idiomatic and conveys the idea that these individuals did not benefit from or experience something they should have. ""Missed this"" is less clear and does not convey the same meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of high quality, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and idiomatic, making it a better translation.

- Machine translation: ""disconnected scientists""
- Reference translation: ""scholars""
- Machine translation: ""portrayal""
- Reference translation: ""Varahamihira""
- Machine translation: ""aryan""
- Reference translation: ""Aryabhata""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation has some significant differences from the reference translation:

1. ""disconnected scientists"" vs. ""scholars"": The term ""disconnected scientists"" is not accurate, as the source text refers to scholars, not necessarily disconnected ones.
2. ""portrayal"" vs. ""Varahamihira"": The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Varahamihira"" as ""portrayal,"" which is not a proper noun and does not make sense in this context.
3. ""aryan"" vs. ""Aryabhata"": Similarly, the machine translation incorrectly translates ""Aryabhata"" as ""aryan,"" which is not a proper noun and does not make sense in this context.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the inaccuracies in translating proper nouns and the misinterpretation of the term ""scholars."" The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text, and the translation errors significantly impact the overall quality.

Machine translation: They received wide powers for automatic control over the previous agreement.
Reference translation: The above agreement gave them broad powers for self-government.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- Machine translation: ""automatic control""
- Reference translation: ""self-government""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the phrase used to describe the powers received. The reference translation uses ""self-government,"" which accurately conveys the idea of the subject having the authority to govern themselves. In contrast, the machine translation uses ""automatic control,"" which implies a more passive and automated form of control, rather than active self-governance.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The quality of the machine translation is poor because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The use of ""automatic control"" instead of ""self-government"" changes the meaning of the sentence and does not align with the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not of good quality, as it does not accurately represent the meaning of the source text.

Machine translation: These often can participate in low levels of fish, but if factors such as weak pools or poor food are influenced by melanoma, the uterus is not infected.
Reference translation: These can often involve low levels of fish , but acute infections do not occur unless they are affected by factors such as poor pools or poor diet .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""melanoma"" while the reference translation does not. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer and is not relevant to the context of the source text.
2. The machine translation states ""the uterus is not infected,"" which is not present in the reference translation. The reference translation talks about acute infections not occurring unless affected by certain factors.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate in this case. It introduces irrelevant information (melanoma) and makes a statement about the uterus that is not present in the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate and better captures the meaning of the source text.

Machine translation: Performing Holy Al Khur Aan was a problematic and embarrassing task at all times.
Reference translation: Translating the Holy Qur 'an has always been a problematic and difficult task.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""Performing Holy Al Khur Aan"" while the reference translation mentions ""Translating the Holy Qur 'an.""
2. The machine translation describes the task as ""embarrassing"" while the reference translation describes it as ""difficult.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The subject of the machine translation is incorrect. The correct subject should be ""Translating the Holy Qur 'an"" instead of ""Performing Holy Al Khur Aan.""
2. The use of the word ""embarrassing"" instead of ""difficult"" changes the tone and meaning of the sentence. The reference translation accurately conveys the challenge of translating the Holy Qur 'an, while the machine translation focuses on the embarrassment aspect, which is not relevant to the context.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of low quality due to the incorrect subject and the use of an irrelevant adjective. The reference translation is more accurate and conveys the intended meaning of the source text.

Machine translation: If it's so harsh, the Metropolitan King, this was a fatal problem.
Reference translation: It was so bad that it was a big problem for the King of Kandy too.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""the Metropolitan King"" while the reference translation mentions ""the King of Kandy."" The source text refers to ""මහනුවර රජතුමා"" which translates to ""King of Kandy."" The machine translation has incorrectly translated this as ""the Metropolitan King.""
2. The machine translation adds the phrase ""If it's so harsh,"" which is not present in the source text or the reference translation. This phrase is not necessary for the translation and adds an unnecessary assumption.
3. The machine translation uses the word ""fatal"" while the reference translation uses ""big."" The source text uses the word ""ගැටලුව"" which can be translated as ""problem"" or ""difficulty."" Both ""fatal"" and ""big"" are possible translations, but ""big"" is more appropriate in this context as it conveys the severity of the problem without implying a life-threatening situation.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

The machine translation has some inaccuracies and adds unnecessary information. The translation of ""මහනුවර රජතුමා"" as ""the Metropolitan King"" is incorrect, and the addition of ""If it's so harsh,"" is not present in the source text. The use of ""fatal"" instead of ""big"" also changes the meaning of the sentence.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor due to inaccuracies and the addition of unnecessary information. The reference translation is more accurate and captures the meaning of the source text better.

Reference translation: Galtam Yaya can be identified as the temple of the ancient Kurudiyawala.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

In the source text, the main subject is the identification of something related to the ancient Kurudiyawala. The machine translation, however, talks about the identification of larvae of an old bird as the galtam. This is a significant difference from the reference translation, which mentions the identification of Galtam Yaya as the temple of the ancient Kurudiyawala.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate in this case, as it does not correctly convey the meaning of the source text. The reference translation, on the other hand, accurately captures the intended meaning of the source text.

Step 4: Provide a conclusion.

The quality of the Sinhala-English translation is poor in this case, as the machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The reference translation, however, is accurate and provides a clear understanding of the source text's meaning.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it mentions ""sugar potatoes"" instead of ""sugarcane production."" This difference in translation can lead to confusion, as ""sugar potatoes"" are not the same as sugarcane, which is the correct term for the source material used in sugar production.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is poor due to the incorrect translation of ""sugar potatoes"" instead of ""sugarcane production."" This error changes the meaning of the sentence and does not accurately represent the source material.

Machine translation: Allium cepa is a peculiar species known by the genus Allium.
Reference translation: Allium cepa is a unique variety known for its cultivation.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""peculiar species known by the genus Allium.""
- Reference translation: ""unique variety known for its cultivation.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation uses the term ""peculiar"" while the reference translation uses ""unique."" The term ""peculiar"" can have a negative connotation, while ""unique"" is more positive.
- The machine translation mentions ""known by the genus Allium,"" which is not present in the reference translation. This part of the sentence is redundant, as Allium cepa is already specified as a species within the genus Allium.
- The reference translation mentions ""known for its cultivation,"" which is not present in the machine translation. This part of the sentence is important to understand the context of the source, as it highlights the significance of Allium cepa in cultivation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
Based on the analysis, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The use of ""peculiar"" instead of ""unique"" and the inclusion of redundant information detract from the overall quality of the translation.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. Machine translation: ""genetic silence""
   Reference translation: ""gene mitigation""
2. Machine translation: ""that contributed to human Huntington patents""
   Reference translation: ""involving human Huntington patients""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The phrase ""genetic silence"" is not an accurate translation of ""ජාන නිහඬකරණ"" (gene mitigation). ""Genetic silence"" implies the complete removal or suppression of a gene, while ""gene mitigation"" implies a reduction or lessening of the gene's effects.
2. The machine translation adds the phrase ""that contributed to human Huntington patents,"" which is not present in the source or reference translation. This phrase suggests that the experiment led to patents related to human Huntington diseases, which is not mentioned in the source or reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. The translation of ""ජාන නිහඬකරණ"" (gene mitigation) as ""genetic silence"" is incorrect, and the addition of the phrase ""that contributed to human Huntington patents"" is not supported by the source or reference translation.

Machine translation: In 1627, an army of 30,000 troops from jürchen, nürki's nephew amin's leader, defeated the joseon army.

Reference translation: In 1627 , a Jurchen army of 30,000 troops , led by Nurhaki 's son - in - law , defeated Joseon 's army .

Now, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""jürchen"" is used instead of ""Jurchen.""
2. In the machine translation, ""nürki's nephew amin's leader"" is used instead of ""Nurhaki 's son - in - law.""

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has some errors in the names and the relationship between the characters. The reference translation provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

340	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: •ආණ්ඩුකාරවරයා සතු අවධාරිත හා නිෂේධ බලය නිසා ඔහුගේ බලය වර්ධනය වීම.
Machine translation: • The Governor has the ability to develop his powers due to concentration and inhibition.
Reference translation: Growing power of the Governor due to his emphasized and veto power.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""concentration and inhibition"" while the reference translation mentions ""emphasized and veto power.""
2. The machine translation states that the Governor has the ability to develop his powers, while the reference translation focuses on the growing power of the Governor.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. It misses the key concepts of ""emphasized"" and ""veto power"" and instead focuses on ""concentration and inhibition."" Additionally, the machine translation does not accurately capture the idea of the growing power of the Governor.

Step 4: Provide a final evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation quality.

The quality of the Sinhala-English translation is poor. The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and misses important concepts. A more accurate translation would be: ""The growing power of the Governor due to his emphasized and veto authority.""
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

341	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Sinhala-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: එමෙන්ම වාෂ්ප නැව් නිපදවීමත් සමග තෙල් කර්මාන්තය පවත්වාගෙන යාම සඳහා වාෂ්ප බලය නැතුවම බැරි බලශක්තියක් වී තිබුණි.
Machine translation: Also with the construction of steamships, the oil industry was an impossible energy without steam power.
Reference translation: Also , with the construction of steam ships , steam power became an indispensable force for sustaining the oil industry .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation says ""the oil industry was an impossible energy without steam power,"" while the reference translation says ""steam power became an indispensable force for sustaining the oil industry.""
2. The machine translation omits the phrase ""Also,"" which is present in the reference translation.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The machine translation misinterprets the meaning of the source text. The source text states that steam power is essential for the oil industry, while the machine translation suggests that the oil industry was impossible without steam power.
2. The omission of ""Also"" in the machine translation changes the meaning slightly, as it implies that the construction of steamships is the reason for the oil industry's existence, rather than just emphasizing the importance of steam power in the oil industry.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of low quality because it misinterprets the meaning of the source text and omits important information. The reference translation is more accurate and conveys the intended meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: මේ අතර ජර්මන් සම්භවයක් ඇති බෞද්ධ භික්ෂුවක් 'සතුරු හමුදාවේ' යයි සැක කොට සිර ගත කරන ලදී.
Machine translation: Meanwhile, a Buddhist monk in the German s ' hostile army was suspected of being imprisoned.
Reference translation: Meanwhile , a Buddhist monk of German descent was imprisoned on suspicion of being in the ' enemy army ' .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation has a grammatical error: ""German s ' hostile army"" should be ""German descent"".
2. The machine translation has a different sentence structure: ""a Buddhist monk in the German s ' hostile army was suspected of being imprisoned"" vs ""a Buddhist monk of German descent was imprisoned on suspicion of being in the ' enemy army '"".

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation has a grammatical error and a different sentence structure, which makes it less accurate than the reference translation. The reference translation is clearer and more accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is lower than the reference translation due to the grammatical error and different sentence structure.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.
