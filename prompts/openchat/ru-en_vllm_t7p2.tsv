Source: Л. Петрушевская в гостях у В.Познера ::
Machine translation: L. Petrushevskaya on a visit to V.Pozner::
Reference translation: L. Petrushevskaya visiting V.Pozner : :

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses the phrase ""on a visit to"" while the reference translation uses ""visiting.""
2. The machine translation includes a double colon (::) at the end, while the reference translation does not.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The phrase ""on a visit to"" is a more literal translation of the Russian phrase ""в гостях у,"" while ""visiting"" captures the essence of the interaction more accurately. The reference translation is more concise and conveys the intended meaning more effectively.
2. The double colon in the machine translation is not necessary and does not add any meaningful information to the sentence. The reference translation is more concise and easier to understand.

Machine translation: With a harrow on the water I went, and with a chain the fish will die.
Reference translation: I went with a harrow on the water , and fished with a flail .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""With a harrow on the water I went, and with a chain the fish will die.""
- Reference translation: ""I went with a harrow on the water , and fished with a flail .""

Differences:
1. The machine translation mentions ""a chain"" while the reference translation mentions ""a flail.""
2. The machine translation says ""the fish will die"" while the reference translation says ""fished.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The difference in the tool used: ""a chain"" vs. ""a flail.""
   - The source text uses ""цепом"" which can be translated as ""chain"" or ""flail."" However, the reference translation uses ""flail,"" which is more appropriate in this context. A ""chain"" is not a tool used for fishing, while a ""flail"" is a type of fishing tool. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""цепом"" as ""chain,"" which leads to a less accurate translation.

2. The difference in the action: ""the fish will die"" vs. ""fished.""
   - The source text uses ""рыбу удит"" which means ""fishing with a flail"" or ""catching fish with a flail."" The machine translation incorrectly interprets this as ""the fish will die,"" which is not the intended meaning. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of the source text by using ""fished.""

Conclusion: The machine translation is of low quality because it incorrectly translates ""цепом"" as ""chain"" and misinterprets the action in the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and captures the intended meaning of the source text.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Гендиректор - Ни литра молока не пропало
Machine translation: CEO - Not a Liter of Milk Lost
Reference translation: CEO - Not a Liter of Milk was Lost

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of the verb ""was lost"" in the reference translation, while the machine translation uses ""Lost"" without the auxiliary verb ""was.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is slightly different from the reference translation in terms of grammar. The use of ""was lost"" in the reference translation is more grammatically correct in English, as it indicates a past perfect tense, which implies that the action (losing a liter of milk) has been completed in the past and is related to a previous action or situation. The machine translation, on the other hand, uses the simple past tense ""Lost,"" which is less precise and may not convey the same meaning as the reference translation.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.

The overall quality of the machine translation is moderate. While it conveys the main idea of the source text, it lacks the precision and grammatical correctness of the reference translation. The use of the past perfect tense in the reference translation is more appropriate for the context and helps to clarify the relationship between the actions described in the source text.

In conclusion, the machine translation is a reasonable approximation of the source text, but it could be improved by using the past perfect tense to better convey the meaning and maintain grammatical accuracy.

The machine translation omits the word ""but,"" which changes the emphasis of the sentence. The reference translation emphasizes that it will be what God gives, while the machine translation simply states that it will be what God gives.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences in meaning due to the omission of the word ""but"" and the slightly different phrasing. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by more closely matching the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: The Yid feasts on weekdays, the Russian feasts, and burns on holidays.
Reference translation: The Jew also feasts on weekdays , the Russian grieves even on holidays .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- In the machine translation, ""The Yid feasts on weekdays, the Russian feasts, and burns on holidays.""
- In the reference translation, ""The Jew also feasts on weekdays , the Russian grieves even on holidays.""

Differences:

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- ""petrified neck"" vs ""cursed neck""
- The addition of ""yes"" in the machine translation

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

- The addition of ""yes"" in the machine translation is unnecessary and does not add any value to the translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not of high quality because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The translation of ""окаянной шее"" as ""petrified neck"" is incorrect, and the addition of ""yes"" is unnecessary.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: За морем веселье, да чужое, а у нас и горе, да своё.
Machine translation: Beyond the sea is merriment, but we have sorrow, and our own.
Reference translation: Overseas there is someone else 's fun , and here we have our own grief .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: ""Beyond the sea is merriment, but we have sorrow, and our own.""
- Reference translation: ""Overseas there is someone else 's fun , and here we have our own grief .""

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""Beyond the sea"" while the reference translation uses ""Overseas.""
2. The machine translation uses ""merriment"" while the reference translation uses ""fun.""
3. The machine translation uses ""we have sorrow"" while the reference translation uses ""we have our own grief.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. ""Beyond the sea"" and ""Overseas"" are synonymous and can be considered equivalent in meaning.
2. ""Merriment"" and ""fun"" are also synonymous and can be considered equivalent in meaning.
3. The machine translation omits the possessive pronoun ""someone else 's"" which is present in the reference translation. This omission changes the meaning slightly, as the reference translation emphasizes that the fun belongs to someone else, while the machine translation does not make this distinction.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, with only a slight difference in meaning due to the omission of the possessive pronoun. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but not perfect.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Я просто стояла и молчала пока он орал за столиком на весь магазин остальные гадости про меня.
Machine translation: I just stood there and kept silent while he was shouting all over the shop about me.
Reference translation: I just stood there and kept silent while at the table he was shouting the rest of the nasty things about me all over the shop.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""at the table"" and ""the rest of the nasty things.""

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences on the overall meaning and quality of the translation.
- The omission of ""at the table"" changes the context of the sentence, as it is now unclear where the shouting took place.
- The omission of ""the rest of the nasty things"" makes the translation less specific about the content of the shouting, which could potentially change the reader's understanding of the situation.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.
- The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation, as it omits important details that contribute to the overall meaning of the sentence.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation due to the omission of important details that impact the context and understanding of the situation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Меш-сети и мессенджеры ::
Machine translation: Mesh networks and messengers::
Reference translation: Mesh networks and messengers : :

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation is ""Mesh networks and messengers::"" while the reference translation is ""Mesh networks and messengers : :"". The only difference is the presence of a colon in the reference translation, which is not present in the machine translation.

Step 3: Analyze the significance of the difference.

The presence of a colon in the reference translation suggests that there might be additional information or context following the phrase. However, in this case, there is no additional information or context provided. The colon may have been included in the reference translation for stylistic reasons or to maintain consistency with the source text.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. The only difference is the absence of a colon, which does not significantly impact the overall meaning or quality of the translation. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is high.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: 12 февраля - день почитания святого Чарльза Дарвина, покровителя медленного, постепенного изменения и приспособления
Machine translation: February 12 is the day of veneration of St. Charles Darwin, patron saint of slow, gradual change and adjustment
Reference translation: February 12 - the day of veneration of Saint Charles Darwin , patron saint of slow , gradual change and adaptation

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""святого Чарльза Дарвина"" is translated as ""St. Charles Darwin,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""Saint Charles Darwin."" The reference translation is more accurate, as it includes the ""Saint"" part, which is a more common way to refer to saints in English.
2. In the machine translation, ""покровителя медленного, постепенного изменения и приспособления"" is translated as ""patron saint of slow, gradual change and adjustment."" In the reference translation, it is translated as ""patron saint of slow , gradual change and adaptation."" The reference translation is more accurate, as it uses the word ""adaptation"" instead of ""adjustment,"" which is a more appropriate term in the context of Charles Darwin's work.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has two minor inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The first inaccuracy is the omission of the ""Saint"" part in the translation of ""святого Чарльза Дарвина."" The second inaccuracy is the use of the word ""adjustment"" instead of ""adaptation."" These inaccuracies slightly affect the overall quality of the translation, but the machine translation still conveys the main idea of the source text.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement to make it more accurate and consistent with the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: To whom to live, and to whom to rot; to whom to work, to whom to sleep.
Reference translation: You get what you deserve.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation is a literal translation of the source text, attempting to convey the meaning of each individual word or phrase. The reference translation, on the other hand, is a more idiomatic translation that captures the overall meaning of the source text in a more natural and concise manner.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not of high quality because it does not convey the overall meaning of the source text in a natural and concise manner. It is a literal translation that focuses on individual words and phrases, rather than capturing the overall meaning of the source text.

Step 4: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation.

The reference translation, ""You get what you deserve,"" is a more idiomatic and concise translation of the source text. It captures the overall meaning of the source text in a more natural and understandable way.

Step 5: Determine the quality of the Russian-English translation.

Based on the analysis, the quality of the Russian-English translation is low. The machine translation is a literal translation that does not convey the overall meaning of the source text in a natural and concise manner.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Одежда — наш компас земной
Machine translation: Clothes are our compass
Reference translation: Clothes are our compass on Earth

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation is ""Clothes are our compass"" while the reference translation is ""Clothes are our compass on Earth."" The difference lies in the addition of the phrase ""on Earth"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the meaning and context of the differences.

The addition of ""on Earth"" in the reference translation provides a more specific context for the statement, implying that the clothes serve as a compass specifically for navigating on Earth. The machine translation, on the other hand, is more general and could be interpreted as a metaphorical statement about the importance of clothes in one's life.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

The machine translation is not entirely incorrect, but it lacks the specificity and context provided by the reference translation. The addition of ""on Earth"" in the reference translation makes the statement more clear and precise, which is important for accurate translation.

Step 5: Provide a conclusion based on the evaluation.

The quality of the machine translation is somewhat lower than the reference translation due to the lack of context and specificity. While the machine translation is still understandable, it could be improved by including the phrase ""on Earth"" to better match the meaning of the source text.

- The machine translation mentions the belly splitting, which is not present in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences to evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text is an idiomatic expression in Russian, which means ""You can't have too much of a good thing."" The machine translation, however, translates the words literally, resulting in a translation that does not make sense in English.
- The machine translation also adds an unrelated idea (the belly splitting) that is not present in the source text or the reference translation.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and adds unrelated ideas.

Machine translation: As a US citizen, on the advice of her Old Believers relatives, she came to see Russia and became a prisoner of a taiga monastery for 15 years
Reference translation: How US citizen came to see Russia following the advice of her old belief relatives and became a prisoner of a taiga monastery for 15 years

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation includes the phrase ""As a US citizen,"" while the reference translation does not.
2. The machine translation uses the term ""Old Believers,"" while the reference translation uses ""old belief.""
3. The machine translation uses the phrase ""on the advice of her Old Believers relatives,"" while the reference translation uses ""following the advice of her old belief relatives.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

1. The inclusion of ""As a US citizen"" in the machine translation adds unnecessary information and does not improve the clarity of the sentence. The reference translation is more concise and to the point.
2. The use of ""Old Believers"" in the machine translation is more accurate than ""old belief"" in the reference translation. ""Old Believers"" refers to a specific religious group, while ""old belief"" is a more general term. However, this difference does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
3. The phrase ""on the advice of her Old Believers relatives"" in the machine translation is more specific than ""following the advice of her old belief relatives"" in the reference translation. The machine translation clearly states that it was her Old Believers relatives who gave her advice, while the reference translation could be interpreted as her relatives in general giving her advice based on their old belief. This difference slightly impacts the overall quality of the translation, as the machine translation is more accurate in conveying the source of the advice.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality, with only minor differences from the reference translation.

- ""Пикабу"" is translated as ""Picabu"" in the machine translation and ""Peekaboo"" in the reference translation.
- ""на"" is translated as ""on"" in the machine translation and ""to"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the translation of ""Пикабу"" could be due to the fact that ""Picabu"" is not a real website or platform, and the machine translation might have made an error in recognizing the correct name. The reference translation correctly identifies ""Peekaboo"" as the correct name of the platform.
- The difference in the translation of ""на"" to ""on"" and ""to"" could be due to the fact that ""на"" can be translated as either ""on"" or ""to"" depending on the context. However, in this case, the context suggests that ""to"" is the more appropriate translation, as the original is being taken to the platform, rather than being placed on it.

Source: Не нашего сукна епанча.
Machine translation: Not our cloth.
Reference translation: Not our level.

Step 2: Identify the key differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
In this case, the key difference is the word ""епанча"" in the source text, which is translated as ""cloth"" in the machine translation and ""level"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Determine the meaning of the word ""епанча"" in the source text.
""Епанча"" is a Russian word that can have multiple meanings, depending on the context. In this case, it seems to be used as a metaphor or idiomatic expression.

Step 4: Analyze the context of the source text to determine the most appropriate translation.
The source text appears to be using ""епанча"" as a metaphor or idiomatic expression, which is not easily translatable into English. However, considering the context, it seems that the speaker is expressing that something is not up to their standards or expectations.

Step 5: Compare the machine translation to the reference translation and determine the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation, ""Not our cloth,"" does not accurately capture the intended meaning of the source text. The reference translation, ""Not our level,"" is more appropriate, as it conveys the idea that something is not up to the speaker's standards or expectations.

The source text simply says ""Молодец, хоть во дворец,"" which can be translated as ""Well done, even in the palace."" The machine translation, however, changes the meaning by saying ""Well done, at least to the palace.""

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not accurate because it adds extra information that is not present in the source text. The reference translation is more accurate as it only includes the phrase ""Well done"" which is present in the source text.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor because it adds extra information that is not present in the source text, making it less accurate than the reference translation.

Machine translation: In some ways, it's not about us.
Reference translation: Once in a long time , still not about us .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""In some ways"" while the reference translation uses ""Once in a long time.""
- The machine translation uses ""it's not about us"" while the reference translation uses ""still not about us.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation captures the general meaning of the source text, which is that something is not about the speaker or their concerns. However, the machine translation is less specific than the reference translation, which uses ""Once in a long time"" to convey the idea that this event or situation is rare.
- The machine translation uses ""In some ways"" which is a more general phrase and may not convey the same level of emphasis on the rarity of the event as the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""it's not about us"" which is a more casual and informal way of expressing the idea, while the reference translation uses ""still not about us,"" which is more formal and emphasizes the continuity of the situation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate but lacks the specificity and emphasis on the rarity of the event found in the reference translation. The casual and informal phrasing of the machine translation also differs from the more formal tone of the reference translation.

 To evaluate the quality of the Russian-English translation, I will compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify the differences.

Source: Это все вещи в одном ряду с запретом спектакля ""Чиполлино"" . Калька 1970-х годов!"" - пояснил он.
Machine translation: These are all things in line with the ban on the performance of ""Cipollino."" Calca of the 1970s! ""he explained.
Reference translation: These are all things in line with the ban on the performance of "" Cipollino "" . The repetition of the 1970s , he explained .

Differences:
1. The machine translation does not include the phrase ""The repetition of the 1970s"" which is present in the reference translation. This phrase is important as it adds context to the explanation.
2. The machine translation uses ""Calca of the 1970s"" instead of ""The repetition of the 1970s."" ""Calca"" is not a proper translation of the original Russian word ""Калька"" and does not convey the same meaning.
3. The machine translation does not use quotation marks around ""Cipollino,"" which is not a significant error but does make the reference translation more clear.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a clearer and more complete understanding of the source text. The machine translation has some errors in translation and omits important context.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Пздц какой ленивый
Machine translation: What a lazy man
Reference translation: Fck what a lazy man

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of the word ""Fck"" in the reference translation. This word is a profanity and is not present in the machine translation.

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is missing the profanity present in the reference translation. This could be due to the translation algorithm not recognizing the profanity or not being programmed to include it. However, the overall meaning of the sentence is still conveyed accurately in the machine translation, as both translations express frustration or annoyance with someone being lazy.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Considering the context and the overall meaning of the sentence, the machine translation is of good quality. The omission of the profanity does not significantly impact the understanding of the sentence, and the translation is accurate in conveying the intended emotion.

- The machine translation uses ""Cross the Yid"" while the reference translation uses ""Baptize the Yid.""
- The machine translation uses ""drown it"" while the reference translation uses ""drown them.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the first part of the sentence (""Cross the Yid"" vs. ""Baptize the Yid"") is significant. ""Cross"" is not an accurate translation of ""перекрестить,"" which means ""baptize"" or ""christen."" This error changes the meaning of the sentence.
- The difference in the second part of the sentence (""drown it"" vs. ""drown them"") is less significant. Both phrases convey the idea of drowning someone, but ""drown them"" is more accurate because the source uses the plural form ""их"" (them), which is not reflected in the machine translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is of low quality because it inaccurately translates the verb ""перекрестить"" as ""cross"" instead of ""baptize"" or ""christen.""

- The machine translation talks about what has happened and what will happen, while the reference translation focuses on what will happen next.

Step 3: Analyze the differences in terms of accuracy and quality.
- The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The source text seems to be a Russian proverb, which roughly translates to ""What has been seen by our ancestors, will be seen by our descendants.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.
- The use of ""August the priest"" instead of ""Father August"" is a minor error, as ""August"" is still a title for a priest. However, ""Father"" is more commonly used in English.
- The use of ""the peasant"" instead of ""the common folk"" is a more significant error, as ""the peasant"" is a more specific term and may not accurately represent the broader group of people being referred to in the source.
- The inclusion of ""care"" in addition to ""work"" is a minor error, as ""labor"" in the reference translation can encompass both care and work. However, it may slightly change the meaning of the sentence.

 To evaluate the quality of the Russian-English translation, I will compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify the differences.

1. Source: Она нашла себе нового парня, с ним же и живет, но все еще продолжает писать мне о том как ей без меня плохо и она не знает что с собой делать, потому что просто не хочет полноценно влюбляться в нового молодого человека, так как боится забыть меня.

2. Machine translation: She has found a new boyfriend, and she lives with him, but she still keeps writing to me about how bad she is without me, and she doesn't know what to do with herself, because she just doesn't want to fall fully in love with a new young man, because she's afraid to forget me.

3. Reference translation: She has found a new boyfriend , and she lives with him , but she still keeps writing to me about how she misses me , and she 'd doesn 't know what to do with herself , because she just doesn 't want to fall fully in love with a new young man , because she 's afraid to forget me .

Differences:
- The machine translation uses ""bad"" while the reference translation uses ""misses"" to describe the girl's feelings without the other person.
- The machine translation uses ""doesn't know what to do with herself"" while the reference translation uses ""doesn't know what to do with herself"" to describe the girl's uncertainty.
- The machine translation uses ""afraid to forget me"" while the reference translation uses ""afraid to forget me"" to describe the girl's fear.

Analysis:
The machine translation is mostly accurate and captures the overall meaning of the source text. However, there are some minor differences in word choice that may slightly affect the meaning. The machine translation uses ""bad"" instead of ""misses,"" which may not convey the same level of emotional longing as the reference translation. Additionally, the machine translation uses ""doesn't know what to do with herself"" instead of the more specific ""doesn't know what to do with herself"" from the reference translation. These differences may result in a slightly less accurate translation, but the overall meaning is still clear.

The presence of the comma in the reference translation creates a slight pause, which may emphasize the importance of the anti-social sources of crime in the context of the sentence. However, the overall meaning of the sentence remains the same in both translations.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is of high quality, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is only slightly different from the reference translation. The difference in punctuation does not significantly impact the overall meaning or quality of the translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Жукова судят, точно так же склеивая факты и обвинение.
Machine translation: Zhukov is tried in the same way that facts and charges are glued together.
Reference translation: Zhukov is tried in the same way by sticking together facts and charges.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""in the same way that"" while the reference translation uses ""by sticking together.""
- The machine translation uses ""facts and charges are glued together"" while the reference translation uses ""facts and charges.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in phrasing between ""in the same way that"" and ""by sticking together"" does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both phrases convey the idea that the facts and charges are being combined in a way that is not necessarily logical or fair.
- The difference between ""facts and charges are glued together"" and ""facts and charges"" is more significant. The machine translation implies that the facts and charges are physically glued together, while the reference translation simply states that they are combined. This difference in meaning could potentially impact the understanding of the sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of the same quality as the reference translation. While the differences in phrasing do not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence, the difference in the description of how the facts and charges are combined does. The machine translation could potentially lead to a misunderstanding of the sentence's meaning.

Machine translation: The Yekaterinburg graffiti festival ""Stenography"" will coordinate the work with the ROC.
Reference translation: The Yekaterinburg graffiti festival "" Stenography "" will coordinate its work with the Russian Orthodox Church .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""ROC"" as an abbreviation for the Russian Orthodox Church, while the reference translation spells out the full name.
2. The machine translation uses ""its"" to refer to the festival, while the reference translation uses the possessive form ""work.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

1. The use of ""ROC"" as an abbreviation is acceptable, as it is a commonly used abbreviation for the Russian Orthodox Church. However, it may not be immediately clear to all readers what ""ROC"" stands for.
2. The use of ""its"" in the machine translation is grammatically correct, but the possessive form ""work"" in the reference translation is more specific and clear.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.

Reference translation: Please support me ? At 22 years old , I don 't feel loved and I feel a weak girl who also needs to be taken care of .

Differences:

1. The machine translation omits the phrase ""I don't feel loved"" from the source, which is present in the reference translation. This omission changes the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the speaker feels loved in the machine translation, while they do not in the reference translation.

2. The machine translation translates ""слабой девушкой"" as ""a loved and weak girl,"" while the reference translation translates it as ""a weak girl."" The machine translation combines ""loved"" and ""weak"" into one phrase, which is not accurate. The reference translation separates the two adjectives, making it clear that the speaker feels weak but not necessarily loved.

3. The machine translation adds the word ""also"" before ""needs to be taken care of,"" which is not present in the reference translation. This addition changes the meaning slightly, as it emphasizes that the speaker needs to be taken care of in the same way as other people.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The differences in translation affect the meaning of the sentence and make the machine translation less clear.

- The use of ""is stronger than the law"" in the machine translation includes the definite article ""the"" which is not present in the reference translation. This is also a minor difference and does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is very close to the reference translation in terms of meaning and structure. The only differences are the inclusion of articles, which are minor and do not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.
- The machine translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source text, which is the primary goal of translation.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is high. It is very close to the reference translation in terms of meaning and structure, and effectively conveys the meaning of the source text.

- The difference in the translation of ""Федот"" is minor, as ""Fedotov"" is a common Russian last name derived from ""Федот."" However, the source text does not provide enough context to determine if this is the correct translation.
- The difference in the translation of ""да не тот"" is more significant. The machine translation uses ""not that one,"" which is a more direct translation, while the reference translation uses ""but not that one,"" which adds a contrasting element to the sentence. The machine translation may be less accurate in this case, as it does not fully capture the meaning of the source text.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
- The overall quality of the machine translation is moderate. While it is mostly accurate, it does not fully capture the meaning of the source text in one instance. The translation could be improved by adding the contrasting element to better match the reference translation.

Machine translation: Many are not even given a crumb.
Reference translation: Many are even deprived of the crumbs.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""not even given"" while the reference translation uses ""even deprived of.""
- The machine translation uses ""a crumb"" while the reference translation uses ""the crumbs.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in phrasing (""not even given"" vs. ""even deprived of"") changes the emphasis of the sentence. The reference translation emphasizes that many people are deprived of even the smallest amount, while the machine translation focuses on the fact that they are not given anything at all.
- The difference in the use of ""a crumb"" vs. ""the crumbs"" is a minor difference in meaning. ""A crumb"" refers to a single small piece, while ""the crumbs"" refers to multiple small pieces. In this context, both translations convey the same general meaning.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some differences in phrasing that change the emphasis of the sentence. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by more accurately conveying the meaning of the source text.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation has a slightly different sentence structure compared to the reference translation.
2. The machine translation has a comma after ""At the same time"" and ""the empire was divided into 4 parts"" which is not present in the reference translation.
3. The machine translation has a comma after ""the real initiator of the persecution was the Emperor Galerius"" which is not present in the reference translation.
4. The machine translation has a comma after ""the persecution was first in the east"" which is not present in the reference translation.
5. The machine translation has a comma after ""and then, under the successor Galerius in general"" which is not present in the reference translation.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. However, there are some minor differences in punctuation and sentence structure that make the machine translation slightly less clear than the reference translation. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement in terms of punctuation and sentence structure.

Source: Житель Бердска предстанет перед судом за фото ВКонтакте
Machine translation: A resident of Berdsk will appear in court for a photo VKontakte
Reference translation: A resident of Berdsk will appear in court for a photo uploaded in VKontakte

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation is: ""A resident of Berdsk will appear in court for a photo VKontakte""
The reference translation is: ""A resident of Berdsk will appear in court for a photo uploaded in VKontakte""

The difference between the two translations is the presence of the word ""uploaded"" in the reference translation, which is not present in the machine translation.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the difference on the overall quality of the translation.

The presence of the word ""uploaded"" in the reference translation provides more context and clarity to the reader, as it specifies that the photo in question was uploaded to the VKontakte platform. The machine translation, without the word ""uploaded,"" is less clear and may leave the reader wondering where the photo was taken or posted.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

The quality of the machine translation is lower than the reference translation due to the omission of the word ""uploaded."" This omission results in a less clear and less accurate translation, which may cause confusion for the reader.

Overall, the machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation due to the difference in the presence of the word ""uploaded.""

- The machine translation correctly captures the main idea of the source text, which is that Patriarch Kirill blessed the crew of a sailboat on a sea procession.
- However, the machine translation has some minor inaccuracies, such as translating ""парусника"" as ""sailboat"" instead of keeping it in the original language. Additionally, the translation of ""Peace"" as a standalone English word instead of using the original Russian word with quotation marks and capitalization is also a minor inaccuracy.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is mostly accurate and captures the main idea of the source text. However, there are some minor inaccuracies in the translation of specific words. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by addressing these minor inaccuracies.

Machine translation: I'll teach you how to love, bitch!
Reference translation: I 'll teach you how to love ambon , bitch !

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation has ""how to love"" while the reference translation has ""how to love ambon.""
- The machine translation does not include the word ""ambon.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is missing the word ""ambon,"" which is an important part of the source text. This omission changes the meaning of the sentence.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Шахтинцы делали радугу и нюхали дождь
Machine translation: Miners made a rainbow and sniffed the rain
Reference translation: The residents of Shakhty made a rainbow and sniffed the rain

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""Miners"" while the reference translation uses ""The residents of Shakhty.""
- The machine translation does not include the word ""The.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it does not correctly translate the subject of the sentence. ""Miners"" is not the correct translation for ""Шахтинцы"" (Shakhty residents).
- The machine translation is missing the article ""The"" at the beginning of the sentence, which makes the sentence sound less natural in English.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.
The overall quality of the machine translation is low. It does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and lacks proper grammar and structure. The reference translation is more accurate and natural in English.

Machine translation: The cost of the tours is 1.95 thousand dollars (about 125,000 roubles), excluding the cost of air tickets from Kilimanjaro and 107,500 roubles from Miracle, including the cost of tickets.
Reference translation: The cost of the tours is 1.95 thousand dollars ( about 125 thousand rubles ) excluding the cost of air tickets from the Kilimanjaro company and 107.5 thousand rubles from Miracle , including the cost of tickets .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, the company name ""Килиманджаро"" is translated as ""Kilimanjaro,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""Kilimanjaro company.""
2. In the machine translation, the amount ""107,5 тысячи рублей"" is translated as ""107,500 roubles,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""107.5 thousand rubles.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The translation of the company name is accurate, so this difference does not affect the quality of the translation.
2. The translation of the amount is not accurate, as ""107,5 тысячи рублей"" should be translated as ""107.5 thousand rubles"" instead of ""107,500 roubles."" This inaccuracy affects the quality of the translation.

Machine translation: A Christian must correct his sins and influence others by personal example.
Reference translation: A Christian must amend his sins and influence others by personal example.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses the word ""correct"" while the reference translation uses the word ""amend.""
- The machine translation uses the word ""influence"" while the reference translation uses the word ""affect.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences in meaning and context.
- ""Correct"" and ""amend"" both convey the idea of making something right or improving it, but ""amend"" has a more specific connotation of making changes to something, often in a formal or official capacity. In this context, ""amend"" is more appropriate, as it relates to the idea of a Christian changing their own behavior and actions.
- ""Influence"" and ""affect"" both relate to the idea of having an impact on others, but ""influence"" implies a more deliberate and direct impact, while ""affect"" can be more indirect or subtle. In this context, ""influence"" is more appropriate, as it relates to the idea of a Christian actively shaping the behavior of others through their actions.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it contains two minor inaccuracies in word choice. The use of ""correct"" instead of ""amend"" and ""influence"" instead of ""affect"" slightly alters the meaning of the sentence, although the overall message is still clear.

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation and reference translation are almost identical, with only a minor difference in punctuation. The reference translation has an apostrophe after ""Putin"" and a space before the comma after ""censorship,"" while the machine translation does not.

2. The machine translation correctly translates the source text, maintaining the meaning and context.

Based on this analysis, I would say that the machine translation is of high quality, as it accurately translates the source text and is only slightly different from the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: According to the authors of the bill, such a norm will be attractive to consumers, because when buying foreign devices, they will immediately receive programs developed with the Russian market in mind.
Reference translation: According to the authors of the bill , such a norm will be attractive to consumers , because when buying foreign devices , they will immediately get programs developed with the Russian market in mind .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation and the reference translation are almost identical, with only one minor difference:

Machine translation: ""...they will immediately receive programs developed with the Russian market in mind.""
Reference translation: ""...they will immediately get programs developed with the Russian market in mind.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The only difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of ""receive"" in the machine translation and ""get"" in the reference translation. Both words can be used to convey the same meaning in this context, so the difference is minimal and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is very close to the reference translation. The minor difference in word choice does not detract from the overall quality of the translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: То и дело читаю в ФБ и ЖЖ:
Machine translation: Time and again I read in the FB and LJ:
Reference translation: Every now and then I come across the following in the FB and LJ :

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""Time and again"" vs. ""Every now and then"": These phrases have similar meanings, but they are not exactly the same. ""Time and again"" implies that the action happens repeatedly, while ""every now and then"" implies that the action happens occasionally.
2. ""I read"" vs. ""I come across"": These verbs have slightly different meanings. ""I read"" implies that the speaker is actively reading the content, while ""I come across"" implies that the speaker accidentally discovered the content.
3. ""in the FB and LJ"" vs. ""in the FB and LJ"": The wording is the same in both translations.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it uses ""Time and again"" instead of ""Every now and then"" and ""I read"" instead of ""I come across."" However, the overall meaning of the translation is still understandable, and the differences are minor.

Step 4: Provide a final assessment of the machine translation quality.

The quality of the machine translation is mostly good, with only minor differences from the reference translation. The translation is understandable and conveys the intended meaning, but it could be improved by using more accurate phrasing.

 To evaluate the quality of the Russian-English translation, I will compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify any differences.

1. Both the machine translation and the reference translation accurately convey the main idea of the source text, which is about a one-and-a-half-minute video that appeared online in late June and was analyzed by the expert group Conflict Intelligence Team.

2. The machine translation and the reference translation are almost identical in terms of wording and structure. The only difference is that the machine translation has a slightly different punctuation in the first sentence: ""The one-and-a-half-minute video, which Maryin writes about, appeared online in late June."" vs. ""The one-and-a-half-minute video, which Maryin writes about, appeared online in late June.""

3. Both translations accurately represent the source text, with no significant omissions or distortions.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Живёт — не тужит, никому не служит.
Machine translation: He lives, he doesn't live, he doesn't serve anyone.
Reference translation: Не dances well to whom fortune pipes .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation is: ""He lives, he doesn't live, he doesn't serve anyone.""
The reference translation is: ""Не dances well to whom fortune pipes.""

The differences are:
- The machine translation is about someone living and not serving anyone, while the reference translation is about someone not dancing well when fortune plays.
- The machine translation is in English, while the reference translation is in Russian.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate because it does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The source text in Russian is ""Живёт — не тужит, никому не служит,"" which can be translated to ""He lives, he doesn't suffer, he doesn't serve anyone."" This is closer to the meaning of the reference translation, ""Не dances well to whom fortune pipes.""

The machine translation is also not in the correct language, as it should be in Russian to match the source text.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and is in the wrong language.

617	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Славны бубны за горами (а к нам придут — как лукошко).
Machine translation: Glorious tambourines are around the corner (and they will come to us like bulbs).
Reference translation: Distance lends enchantment to the view.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

The machine translation is about glorious tambourines being around the corner and coming to us like bulbs. The reference translation is about distance lending enchantment to the view.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. The source text is a Russian proverb that means ""Distance makes the heart grow fonder."" The machine translation does not capture this meaning and instead focuses on the literal translation of the words, which results in a nonsensical translation.

Step 4: Determine the quality of the machine translation.

The quality of the machine translation is poor because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The machine translation is a literal translation of the words, which results in a translation that does not make sense. The reference translation, on the other hand, accurately captures the meaning of the source text and is a high-quality translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: Well, yes, geopolitics is.
Reference translation: Well , yes , geopolitics , let 's say .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation omits the phrase ""let 's say"" which is present in the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses the word ""is"" while the reference translation uses the word ""let's say"" to express a similar meaning.

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.
- The omission of the phrase ""let 's say"" in the machine translation results in a slight loss of meaning compared to the reference translation.
- The use of the word ""is"" in the machine translation is grammatically correct but does not convey the same nuance as the phrase ""let 's say"" in the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it loses some of the nuance present in the reference translation due to the omission of the phrase ""let 's say"" and the use of the word ""is"" instead.

 To evaluate the quality of the Russian-English translation, I will compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify the differences.

Source: Адвокат Шварева Владимир Жеребенков считает обвинение надуманным, а уголовное преследование журналиста заказным.

Machine translation: Shvarev's lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, considers the charge far-fetched, and the criminal prosecution of the journalist ordered.

Reference translation: Shvarev 's lawyer , Vladimir Zherebenkov , considers the charge far-fetched , and the criminal prosecution of the journalist pre-programmed .

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, the phrase ""the criminal prosecution of the journalist ordered"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""the criminal prosecution of the journalist pre-programmed."" The machine translation implies that someone has given an order for the criminal prosecution, while the reference translation suggests that the criminal prosecution is a pre-planned or pre-determined event.

2. The machine translation omits the Russian character ""ь"" in ""Шварева"" and ""Жеребенков,"" which are essential for proper pronunciation in the English transliteration. The reference translation includes these characters.

3. The machine translation uses the word ""far-fetched"" to translate the Russian word ""надуманным,"" while the reference translation uses the word ""far-fetched"" as well. Both translations are accurate in this case.

4. The machine translation uses the word ""ordered"" to translate the Russian word ""заказным,"" which means ""contracted"" or ""arranged."" The reference translation uses the word ""pre-programmed"" to convey the same meaning. Both translations are accurate in this case.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some differences compared to the reference translation. The main difference is in the interpretation of the phrase ""уголовное преследование журналиста заказным."" The machine translation implies an order for the criminal prosecution, while the reference translation suggests a pre-planned event. This difference in interpretation may change the overall meaning of the sentence.

Reference translation: Don 't mess with a fool.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: Fool me, spit me out.
- Reference translation: Don 't mess with a fool.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation is a literal translation of the source text, which results in a somewhat awkward and unnatural-sounding phrase in English.
- The reference translation is a more idiomatic and natural-sounding English phrase that conveys the same meaning as the source text.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is not of high quality because it does not convey the meaning of the source text in a natural and idiomatic way in English.
- The reference translation is of high quality because it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text in a natural and idiomatic way in English.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is low because it does not convey the meaning of the source text in a natural and idiomatic way in English. The reference translation is of high quality because it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text in a natural and idiomatic way in English.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: Overwatch 2 – Разработчики дали интервью, в котором рассказали о планах
Machine translation: Overwatch 2: Developers give interview about plans
Reference translation: Overwatch 2 - The developers gave an interview in which they talked about the plans

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""give"" while the reference translation uses ""gave.""
2. The machine translation uses ""about plans"" while the reference translation uses ""in which they talked about the plans.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""give"" vs. ""gave"" does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence. Both are grammatically correct, but ""gave"" is more appropriate in this context since the interview has already taken place.
2. The machine translation is less specific than the reference translation. The phrase ""about plans"" does not convey the same level of detail as ""in which they talked about the plans."" The reference translation provides a clearer understanding of the context of the interview.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the specificity and clarity of the reference translation. The use of ""gave"" instead of ""give"" is a minor issue, but the difference in phrasing between ""about plans"" and ""in which they talked about the plans"" is more significant. The machine translation conveys the main idea of the source text, but it could be improved to better match the quality of the reference translation.

Machine translation: 2-Question who has already bought a helmet how do you think you spent the money there or is it all a fig leaf and not worth the money
Reference translation: 2-The question is : who has already bought a helmet , do you think it was worth it or you wasted your money

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""Question"" while the reference translation uses ""The question is"".
2. The machine translation uses ""how do you think you spent the money there"" while the reference translation uses ""do you think it was worth it"".
3. The machine translation uses ""or is it all a fig leaf and not worth the money"" while the reference translation uses ""or you wasted your money"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The opening ""Question"" in the machine translation is a more direct translation of the Russian word ""Вопрос"", but the reference translation's ""The question is"" provides a smoother and more natural English phrasing.
2. The machine translation's ""how do you think you spent the money there"" is a more literal translation of the Russian text, while the reference translation's ""do you think it was worth it"" is a more idiomatic and natural way of expressing the same idea in English.
3. The machine translation's ""or is it all a fig leaf and not worth the money"" is a more literal translation of the Russian text, and ""fig leaf"" is an idiomatic expression for something that is meant to cover up or hide something. However, the reference translation's ""or you wasted your money"" is a more straightforward and easily understood way of expressing the same idea in English.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of the highest quality.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: Что есть — вместе, а чего нет — пополам.
Machine translation: What we eat together and what we don't eat is cut in half.
Reference translation: What we have - we have together , but what we don 't have - is split between us .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""eat"" while the reference translation uses ""have.""
2. The machine translation says ""is cut in half"" while the reference translation says ""is split between us.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""eat"" in the machine translation is not accurate, as the source does not specifically mention eating. The reference translation correctly uses ""have"" to encompass a broader range of possessions or shared items.
2. The phrase ""is cut in half"" in the machine translation is not an accurate representation of the source. The reference translation ""is split between us"" more accurately conveys the idea of dividing something between multiple people.

Step 4: Conclude the evaluation of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not of high quality, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The use of ""eat"" instead of ""have"" and ""cut in half"" instead of ""split between us"" lead to a loss in translation accuracy. The reference translation is a more accurate representation of the source text, making it a higher quality translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: чтобы погасить одни долги, люди залезают в новые, и все чаще берут деньги в конторах микрозаймов.
Machine translation: To pay off some debts, people climb into new ones, and increasingly borrow money from micro-loan offices.
Reference translation: people get into new debt to pay off other debts , and increasingly borrow money from micro-loan offices .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""To pay off some debts"" while the reference translation uses ""people get into new debt to pay off other debts.""
- The machine translation uses ""climb into new ones"" while the reference translation uses ""get into new debt.""
- The machine translation uses ""increasingly borrow money"" while the reference translation uses ""increasingly borrow money.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation captures the main idea of the source text, which is about people getting into new debts to pay off old ones and borrowing money from micro-loan offices.
- However, the machine translation is less precise in conveying the meaning of the source text. For example, it uses ""climb into new ones"" instead of ""get into new debt,"" which is less clear and less accurate.
- The machine translation also omits the word ""other"" in ""pay off other debts,"" which slightly changes the meaning of the sentence.

Step 4: Conclude the evaluation of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate in capturing the main idea of the source text, but it is less precise and slightly changes the meaning of the source text. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is moderate.

Source: Сколько волка ни корми — он всё в лес смотрит.
Machine translation: No matter how much the wolf feeds, he looks out into the forest.
Reference translation: Give the wolf the best food , but he would hanker for the wood .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation is a literal translation of the source text, while the reference translation is a more idiomatic and poetic translation.
- The machine translation does not convey the meaning of the source text as effectively as the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is a direct translation of the source text and does not take into account the idiomatic expressions and nuances of the language.
- The reference translation captures the essence of the source text by using an idiomatic expression (""hanker for the wood"") to convey the wolf's longing for the forest.
- The machine translation is not as effective in conveying the meaning of the source text as the reference translation.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Купить кота в мешке.
Machine translation: Buy a cat in a bag.
Reference translation: Buy a pig in a poke.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation says ""cat"" while the reference translation says ""pig.""
- The machine translation says ""in a bag"" while the reference translation says ""in a poke.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the animal mentioned (cat vs. pig) changes the meaning of the phrase. In Russian folklore, buying a ""кота в мешке"" (cat in a bag) is a cautionary tale against making impulsive decisions without fully understanding what you are getting into. In English, the phrase ""buy a pig in a poke"" serves the same purpose. However, the machine translation misses this cultural nuance by translating ""кота"" as ""cat"" instead of ""pig.""
- The difference in the container mentioned (bag vs. poke) also changes the meaning of the phrase. A ""poke"" is a specific type of bag or sack, often used in the past to carry items. The machine translation uses the more general term ""bag,"" which may not convey the same level of caution as the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not of high quality because it misses the cultural nuance of the source phrase and uses a more general term that does not convey the same level of caution as the reference translation. The machine translation is also not a direct translation of the source phrase, as it uses ""cat"" instead of ""pig.""

Reference translation: It 's not even boring to yawn in good company .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""cheerful company"" while the reference translation uses ""good company.""
- The machine translation omits the word ""even"" which is present in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the adjective used to describe the company (cheerful vs. good) may change the meaning slightly. ""Cheerful"" emphasizes the happiness and liveliness of the company, while ""good"" emphasizes the overall positive quality of the company.
- The omission of the word ""even"" changes the emphasis of the sentence. In the reference translation, the use of ""even"" emphasizes that yawning is not boring at all in good company. In the machine translation, the emphasis is slightly different, as it simply states that yawning is not boring in cheerful company.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

727	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: «Конечно он всё растреплет,» думал Господь, удаляясь, «хорошо, что я не рассказал ему про воздушные шарики, мороженое и так далее… И что все дети смогут покататься на слоне…» © Книга Натаниэля
Machine translation: Of course he's going to melt, God thought as he walked away, ""it's good I didn't tell him about balloons, ice cream, and so on, and that all the kids can ride an elephant."" © Nathaniel's book
Reference translation: "" Of course he 's going to tell everything , "" God thought as he walked away , "" it 's good I didn 't tell him about balloons , ice cream , and so on , and that all the kids can ride an elephant . "" © Nathaniel 's book

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the source, the phrase ""Конечно он всё растреплет"" is translated as ""Of course he's going to melt"" in the machine translation and ""Of course he 's going to tell everything"" in the reference translation. The machine translation is different from the reference translation in this part.
2. In the source, the phrase ""думал Господь"" is translated as ""God thought"" in both the machine translation and the reference translation.
3. In the source, the phrase ""удаляясь"" is translated as ""as he walked away"" in both the machine translation and the reference translation.
4. In the source, the phrase ""хорошо, что я не рассказал ему про воздушные шарики, мороженое и так далее"" is translated as ""it's good I didn't tell him about balloons, ice cream, and so on"" in both the machine translation and the reference translation.
5. In the source, the phrase ""И что все дети смогут покататься на слоне"" is translated as ""and that all the kids can ride an elephant"" in both the machine translation and the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze where the machine translation is different from the reference translation.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is in the translation of the phrase ""Конечно он всё растреплет."" The machine translation translates it as ""Of course he's going to melt,"" while the reference translation translates it as ""Of course he 's going to tell everything."" This difference in translation changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""melt"" implies that the subject will be destroyed or dissolved, while ""tell everything"" implies that the subject will reveal all information.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

The quality of the machine translation is not very high, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The translation of the phrase ""Конечно он всё растреплет"" is particularly problematic, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation provides a more accurate translation of the source text, which makes it a better representation of the original meaning.

- The phrase ""I don't care about information"" is a more polite and formal way of expressing the same idea as ""I don't give a damn about the information."" The reference translation uses a more informal and colloquial expression, which might be more appropriate in some contexts.
- The difference between ""I'm in the service of another country"" and ""I am in the service of another country"" is minimal and does not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence. Both phrases convey the same idea, and the difference in verb form is a matter of style rather than accuracy.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by using a more informal and colloquial expression to match the reference translation. The difference in verb form does not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence, so the machine translation is still of high quality.

- The machine translation does not mention ""пивал"" (swill) while the source and reference translation do.
- The machine translation does not mention ""гладок бывал"" (it was smooth) while the source and reference translation do.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""бык"" (bull) as ""pit bull,"" which is a specific breed of dog, not a bull. This is a significant error in the translation.
- The machine translation omits the mention of ""пивал"" (swill), which is an important detail in the source text. This omission changes the meaning of the sentence.
- The machine translation correctly translates ""гладок бывал"" (it was smooth) but the overall translation is still incorrect due to the errors mentioned above.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the incorrect translation of ""бык"" (bull) and the omission of ""пивал"" (swill). The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text.

Reference translation: KGB agent "" Veronika "" since 1987 , aka Mother Superior of the Serafimo-Diveevsky Monastery of the Nizhny Novgorod Diocese .

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""Abbess"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""Mother Superior."" Both terms refer to the head of a convent or monastery, so this difference is not significant.
2. The machine translation uses ""Seraphim-Diveevsky Monastery,"" while the reference translation uses ""Serafimo-Diveevsky Monastery."" This difference is due to the transliteration of the Russian name. The machine translation is more accurate, as ""Seraphim"" is the correct transliteration of the Russian name.
3. The machine translation uses ""Nizhny Novgorod Diocese,"" while the reference translation uses ""Nizhny Novgorod Diocese."" Both translations are correct and convey the same meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is of high quality and accurately conveys the meaning of the source text. The only difference is the use of ""Abbess"" instead of ""Mother Superior,"" which is a minor difference and does not affect the overall quality of the translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Не всё сбывается, что желается.
Machine translation: Not everything comes to pass as desired.
Reference translation: Not everything you wish for comes true.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: Not everything comes to pass as desired.
- Reference translation: Not everything you wish for comes true.

Difference 1: ""Not everything you wish for comes true"" vs ""Not everything comes to pass as desired""
Difference 2: ""you wish for"" vs no equivalent phrase in the machine translation

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Difference 1: The machine translation uses ""as desired"" instead of ""you wish for"" in the reference translation. While both phrases convey a similar meaning, the reference translation is more specific and personal, as it directly addresses the reader. The machine translation is slightly less personal and may not convey the same level of empathy as the reference translation.

Difference 2: The machine translation omits the phrase ""you wish for,"" which is an important part of the reference translation. This omission may cause the machine translation to be less clear and less engaging than the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation captures the general meaning of the source text but lacks the specificity and personal touch found in the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: На кривой суд образца нет.
Machine translation: There is no pattern on the curve.
Reference translation: There is no pattern for the bad trial.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: There is no pattern on the curve.
- Reference translation: There is no pattern for the bad trial.

The main difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the context in which the phrase ""no pattern"" is used. In the machine translation, it refers to a curve, while in the reference translation, it refers to a bad trial.

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.
The machine translation is not entirely accurate because it does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The source text seems to be talking about a ""bad trial"" rather than a curve. The machine translation misses this context and translates the phrase literally, which results in a less accurate translation.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.
The overall quality of the machine translation is poor because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The translation is too literal and does not take into account the context of the source text.

829	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Гальюнный Инцидент - лучше ожиданий
Machine translation: The Gallic Incident Is Better Than Expectations
Reference translation: The Incident of Hull Is Better Than Expected

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation has ""The Gallic Incident"" while the reference translation has ""The Incident of Hull.""
- The machine translation has ""Is Better Than Expectations"" while the reference translation has ""Is Better Than Expected.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the incident name is significant. ""Гальюнный"" (Gallic) is not a proper noun in English, and it is not clear what it refers to. ""Hull"" is a proper noun and refers to a specific location or event.
- The difference in the phrase ""Is Better Than Expectations"" vs. ""Is Better Than Expected"" is a minor grammatical error. The machine translation is not incorrect, but the reference translation is more grammatically accurate.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not entirely accurate due to the incorrect translation of the incident name. However, the overall meaning is still understandable. The quality of the machine translation is fair, but it would benefit from further refinement, especially in the translation of proper nouns and names.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Она отрицает, что уколола мальчика, и утверждает, что он сделал это сам.
Machine translation: She denies stabbing the boy and claims he did it himself.
Reference translation: She denies giving an injection to the boy and claims he did it himself.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses the word ""stabbing"" while the reference translation uses ""giving an injection.""
- The machine translation uses the word ""it"" while the reference translation uses ""an injection.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the verb used to describe the action (stabbing vs. giving an injection) changes the meaning of the sentence. In the source, the action is related to giving an injection, not stabbing.
- The difference in the object of the action (it vs. an injection) also changes the meaning of the sentence. In the source, the object is an injection, not a general object.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not accurate because it changes the meaning of the source by using different verbs and objects. The reference translation is more accurate as it maintains the original meaning of the source. The quality of the machine translation is low.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Шилом моря не нагреешь.
Machine translation: You can't heat the sea.
Reference translation: You cannot catch the wind in the palm of your hand.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: You can't heat the sea.
- Reference translation: You cannot catch the wind in the palm of your hand.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:
- The machine translation talks about heating the sea, while the reference translation talks about catching the wind in the palm of your hand.
- The reference translation uses a metaphor to convey the idea that some things are too difficult or impossible to control, while the machine translation does not convey this metaphorical meaning.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. It misses the metaphorical meaning and focuses on a literal interpretation of the words. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the intended meaning of the source text.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is low, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is a better representation of the intended meaning.

- The machine translation says ""I'm Not Eighteen"" while the reference translation says ""I'm not eighteen yet""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of ""Trick Me"" instead of ""Fuck me"" makes the machine translation less explicit and potentially less accurate in conveying the intended meaning.
- The machine translation omits the word ""yet"" which is important for understanding the meaning of the sentence as it implies that the speaker is not yet eighteen years old.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation. It is less explicit and omits an important word that changes the meaning of the sentence.

851	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: От любви до ненависти — один шаг.
Machine translation: From love to hate, one step.
Reference translation: There is one step from love to hate .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses a comma to separate the two phrases ""From love to hate"" and ""one step,"" while the reference translation uses a period.
- The reference translation has a slightly different word order, placing ""There is one step"" before ""from love to hate.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of a comma in the machine translation makes the sentence feel more like a list or a series of phrases, rather than a complete thought. The period in the reference translation gives the sentence a more definitive statement.
- The word order in the reference translation is more natural in English, making it easier to understand.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not of the highest quality. While it conveys the general meaning of the source text, it lacks the clarity and natural word order of the reference translation. The use of a comma instead of a period also detracts from the overall quality of the translation.

- The machine translation uses the word ""by"" while the reference translation uses the word ""similar to.""
- The machine translation does not include the word ""work"" which is present in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is not entirely accurate as it does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The reference translation implies that the work is similar in style or quality to that of Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, while the machine translation suggests that the work is done by Tarantino and Guy Ritchie themselves.
- The omission of the word ""work"" in the machine translation also affects the overall meaning and quality of the translation.

Step 4: Provide a conclusion based on the analysis.
The machine translation is not of high quality as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and has omitted important information. The reference translation is more accurate and better captures the intended meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 To evaluate the quality of the Russian-English translation, I will compare the machine translation to the reference translation and identify the differences.

Source: После появления сообщений о помиловании россиян директор Службы внешней разведки Сергей Нарышкин пообещал, что Москва примет зеркальные меры.

Machine translation: Following reports of pardons for Russians, Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergei Naryshkin, promised that Moscow would take mirror measures.

Reference translation: Following reports of pardons for Russians , Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service , Sergei Naryshkin , promised that Moscow would take tit for tat measures .

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""mirror measures"" while the reference translation uses ""tit for tat measures."" The phrase ""tit for tat measures"" is more accurate as it conveys the idea of a reciprocal action in response to a specific event or action.

2. The machine translation does not include the word ""pardons"" in the beginning, which is present in the source and reference translation. This omission may lead to confusion for the reader.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The main issue is the use of ""mirror measures"" instead of ""tit for tat measures,"" which changes the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, the omission of the word ""pardons"" in the beginning of the sentence is another point of inaccuracy.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

898	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Russian-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Не зря его учеников одного называли Симон Зелот… То есть зелоты – это тогда и были люди, которые, собственно, бегали с ножами.
Machine translation: Not for nothing were his pupils called Simon Zelotes - that is, the zelots - who were actually running around with knives.
Reference translation: No wonder one of his students was called Simon Zealot ... So the Zealots were then the people who , in fact , ran with knives .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. The machine translation uses ""his pupils"" while the reference translation uses ""one of his students.""
2. The machine translation uses ""Simon Zelotes"" while the reference translation uses ""Simon Zealot.""
3. The machine translation uses ""the zelots"" while the reference translation uses ""the Zealots.""
4. The machine translation uses ""who were actually running around with knives"" while the reference translation uses ""who , in fact , ran with knives.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The difference in the subject (""his pupils"" vs. ""one of his students"") is minor and does not significantly impact the meaning.
2. The difference in the proper noun (""Simon Zelotes"" vs. ""Simon Zealot"") is a minor error, as ""Simon Zelotes"" is likely a typo and should be ""Simon Zealot.""
3. The difference in the capitalization of ""the zelots"" vs. ""the Zealots"" is a minor formatting error and does not impact the meaning.
4. The difference in the phrasing (""who were actually running around with knives"" vs. ""who , in fact , ran with knives"") is a minor stylistic difference and does not impact the meaning.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality, with only minor differences from the reference translation that do not significantly impact the meaning. The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.
