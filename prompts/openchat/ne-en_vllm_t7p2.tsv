 To evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation, I will first read and understand the source text, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation to determine the quality of the translation.

Source: २६ र २७ गते दुर्इदिनसम्म सत्याग्रह चलेपछि राजकीय परिषदबाट मागहरू पूरा गरिदिने स्वीकृति प्राप्त भएकाले नेपाली कांग्रेसका अध्यक्ष वी.पी.

Machine translation: W. P., chairman of the Nepali Congress, who obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council after a satellite run of 26 and 27.

Reference translation: B. P., the chairman of the Nepali Congress , who obtained a permit to complete demands from the royal council after a Satyagrah run of 26 and 27 .

Differences between machine translation and reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, the name of the chairman is written as ""W. P."" while in the reference translation, it is written as ""B. P."". This is a minor difference, and it is possible that the machine translation has a typo or an incorrect name.
2. The machine translation mentions ""a satellite run"" while the reference translation mentions ""a Satyagrah run."" This is a significant difference as ""Satyagrah"" refers to a nonviolent resistance movement, and ""satellite"" is not relevant in this context.

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not accurate and does not convey the correct meaning of the source text. The translation has errors in the name of the chairman and the context of the ""run."" Therefore, the quality of the Nepali-English translation is poor.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: पछि गरिएका अनुसन्धानहरुबाट उनको जन्म दक्षिण भारतमा भएको जानकारी प्राप्त हुन्छ ।
Machine translation: His birthday from later investigations is obtained in South India.
Reference translation: From later investigations , this information is obtained that he was born in South India .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation starts with ""His birthday from later investigations is obtained in South India,"" while the reference translation starts with ""From later investigations.""
2. The machine translation uses ""this information is obtained that he was born in South India,"" while the reference translation uses ""this information is obtained that he was born in South India.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The machine translation starts with ""His birthday from later investigations is obtained in South India,"" which is less clear and less natural than the reference translation's ""From later investigations.""
2. The machine translation uses ""this information is obtained that he was born in South India,"" which is slightly less clear than the reference translation's ""this information is obtained that he was born in South India.""

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is not as clear and natural as the reference translation. The differences in the beginning of the sentences and the structure of the sentence make the machine translation less effective. The overall quality of the Nepali-English translation is not very high.

Source: त्यस बराबरी खेलको दुई हप्तापछि उनीहरू बीच पुन खेल भयो तर खेल पहिलाको जस्तै बराबरीमा समाप्त भएको थियो।
Machine translation: After two weeks of that equal game, they were rebounded between them, but the game ended as before.
Reference translation: Two weeks after that draw , they played again , but the game ended in a draw like the previous game .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""rebounded"" instead of ""played again"" from the reference translation.
- The machine translation says ""the game ended as before"" instead of ""the game ended in a draw like the previous game"" in the reference translation.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not entirely accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. The use of ""rebounded"" is not appropriate in this context, and the ending of the game is not clearly stated as a draw like the previous game.

Step 4: Provide a corrected machine translation.
A corrected machine translation would be: ""Two weeks after that draw, they played again, but the game ended in a draw like the previous game.""

Source: सङ्घीयताको आधुनिक अवधारणा संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिकामा सन् १७७६ देखि १७८९ बीचमा भएको मानिन्छ।
Machine translation: The modern concept of federalism is considered to have been between 1776 and 1789 in the United States.
Reference translation: The modern concept of federalism is considered to have originated in the United States between 1776 and 1789 .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses the word ""been"" while the reference translation uses the word ""originated.""
- The machine translation does not include the word ""originated"" from the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences on the quality of the translation.
- The use of ""been"" in the machine translation is not incorrect, but it does not convey the same meaning as ""originated"" in the reference translation.
- The omission of ""originated"" from the machine translation results in a less precise translation compared to the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the precision of the reference translation due to the omission of the word ""originated"" and the use of ""been"" instead.

Conclusion: The quality of the Nepali-English machine translation is good but not perfect. It is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by including the word ""originated"" and using the word ""originated"" instead of ""been.""

Machine translation: But nonprofit taxable assets will be considered a working investment.
Reference translation: But keeping non-commercial taxable assets will be considered an investment .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""nonprofit"" while the reference translation uses ""non-commercial.""
- The machine translation uses ""working investment"" while the reference translation uses ""an investment.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The use of ""nonprofit"" and ""non-commercial"" are synonymous in this context, so this difference does not significantly impact the quality of the translation.
- The use of ""working investment"" versus ""an investment"" is a more significant difference. ""Working investment"" implies that the investment is being actively used or managed, while ""an investment"" is a more general term that does not necessarily imply active use or management. This difference could impact the quality of the translation, as the original source may not have intended to convey the idea of an actively managed investment.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
Based on the analysis, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has a slight difference in meaning compared to the reference translation. The difference in meaning could potentially impact the overall quality of the translation. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is mostly good but could be improved by aligning it more closely with the reference translation.

This difference may affect the meaning slightly, as ""has given"" implies a specific point in time when the authority was granted, while ""has"" could be interpreted as the center always having this authority.

Difference 2: The use of ""on the command"" in the machine translation implies that the units are following the command, while ""under the command"" in the reference translation implies that the units are operating within the command structure. This difference may affect the meaning slightly, as ""under the command"" suggests a more direct relationship between the units and the center.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in meaning due to the choice of words. The reference translation is clearer in conveying the relationship between the center and the units. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement in capturing the nuances of the original text.

Machine translation: Office on policy and circumstances not to integrate or divide the base
Reference translation: Office in relation to unification or division on the basis of policy and circulars etc.

Differences:

1. The machine translation omits the word ""in relation to"" present in the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""taking the name of the drug"" while the reference translation mentions ""putting the name of the medicine.""
2. The machine translation says ""took this candlestick"" while the reference translation does not mention a candlestick.
3. The machine translation says ""as a reason for a disease"" while the reference translation says ""while explaining the cause of another disease.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation's use of ""taking the name of the drug"" is not as clear as the reference translation's ""putting the name of the medicine.""
2. The mention of ""taking this candlestick"" in the machine translation is not present in the source or reference translation and is irrelevant to the context.
3. The machine translation's ""as a reason for a disease"" is less accurate than the reference translation's ""while explaining the cause of another disease.""

Step 4: Conclusion

The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the unclear phrasing, irrelevant mention of a candlestick, and less accurate representation of the source material. The reference translation is more accurate and clear in conveying the meaning of the source text.

 To evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation, I will compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify the differences.

Source: अहिले यसलाई देउडा गीत, देउडा संस्कृती, देउडा भाषा, देउडा खेल आदि नामले  चिनिन्छ ।
Machine translation: Nowadays it is known by the name deoda song, deoda culture, deoda language, deuda games, etc.
Reference translation: Now it is known as the name Deuda song , Deuda culture , Deuda language , Deuda game , etc .

Differences:
1. In the machine translation, ""deuda"" is written as ""deouda"" in the phrase ""deouda song"" and ""deouda games."" This is likely a typo and should be corrected to ""deuda.""
2. In the machine translation, ""deuda"" is written as ""deouda"" in the phrase ""deouda language."" This is likely a typo and should be corrected to ""deuda.""
3. The machine translation uses ""etc."" to indicate the end of the list, while the reference translation uses a comma followed by ""etc.""

Considering these differences, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has a few typos and a slight difference in punctuation. The overall quality of the translation is good, but it could be improved by correcting the typos and following the reference translation's punctuation.

Machine translation: And I will make the city steadfast by the way which I have done.
Reference translation: I will make the city stable from the virtue which I have done.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""steadfast"" while the reference translation uses ""stable.""
- The machine translation uses ""by the way which I have done"" while the reference translation uses ""from the virtue which I have done.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The word ""steadfast"" is a more literal translation of the Nepali word ""स्थिर"" (sthir), which means stable or firm. However, ""stable"" is a more appropriate choice in this context, as it conveys the idea of making the city strong and secure.
- The phrase ""by the way which I have done"" is a less accurate translation of the Nepali phrase ""पुण्यद्वारा"" (punyadwara), which means ""from the virtue which I have done."" The reference translation more accurately captures the idea of the city's stability being derived from the speaker's virtuous actions.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. While it captures the general meaning of the source text, it does not convey the specific idea of the city's stability being derived from the speaker's virtuous actions.

Machine translation: The twins tree is referred to as a symbol of the gender nonsense, and the person who is born in this nonsense is a variant of worshiping the twins.
Reference translation: The twin tree is referred as the symbol of Bharani constellation and it is customary for a person born in this constellation to worship the twin tree .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation refers to the symbol as ""gender nonsense"" while the reference translation correctly identifies it as the ""Bharani constellation.""
- The machine translation mentions ""a variant of worshiping the twins,"" which is not present in the reference translation. The reference translation simply states that it is customary for a person born in this constellation to worship the twin tree.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. It incorrectly translates the symbol as ""gender nonsense"" instead of the correct ""Bharani constellation."" Additionally, the machine translation adds an unnecessary detail about a ""variant of worshiping the twins"" that is not present in the reference translation.

Step 4: Provide a conclusion.
The quality of the Nepali-English machine translation is poor. It does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and introduces unnecessary details. A better translation would be: ""The twin tree is referred to as a symbol of the Bharani constellation, and it is customary for a person born in this constellation to worship the twin tree.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- ""word"" vs. ""term"": In this context, both ""word"" and ""term"" can be considered accurate translations of the Nepali word ""शब्द"". However, ""term"" is more appropriate in this context, as it refers to a specific expression or phrase with a particular meaning.
- ""will not indicate"" vs. ""does not refer to"": Both phrases convey the same meaning, but ""does not refer to"" is more concise and accurate in this context.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences in word choice and phrasing compared to the reference translation. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using more accurate and concise language.

Source: सामान्यतया जुनसुकै वर्षमा माघ ११ गतेदेखि माघ २३ गतेसम्म सूर्यले यस नक्षत्रको भ्रमण गरेको देख्न सकिन्छ।

Translation: Generally, in any year, from January 24 to February 5, the Sun can be seen visiting this constellation.

Now, I will analyze the differences between the source text and the machine translation.

Machine translation: Normally, the sun can be seen visiting this northern territory from late 11th to early 23rd centuries.

The machine translation has some inaccuracies:

1. ""late 11th to early 23rd centuries"" is incorrect. The correct time frame should be ""from January 24 to February 5"".
2. ""northern territory"" is not the correct translation for ""नक्षत्रको भ्रमण"" (constellation's journey).

The reference translation is more accurate:

Reference translation: Generally, in any year, from January 24 to February 5, the Sun can be seen visiting this constellation.

The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of the source text and is more accurate than the machine translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation has some inaccuracies and does not fully capture the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and should be considered the better translation.

- The machine translation says ""the same creature is sanctified in our sight,"" while the reference translation says ""the same sense makes us pure.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation captures the general idea of the source text, but it is not as accurate as the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses the phrase ""the same creature"" instead of ""the same sense,"" which changes the meaning slightly.
- The machine translation also uses the phrase ""sanctified in our sight"" instead of ""makes us pure,"" which again changes the meaning slightly.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It captures the general idea of the source text, but it is not as precise in conveying the meaning. The differences in phrasing and word choice between the machine translation and the reference translation result in a slightly different meaning.

Machine translation: On October 8 and one episode of the show, cm punk had his encounter with ii while mcmen spoke.
Reference translation: In a series on October 8 , CM Punk confronted McMahon while he was speaking .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""one episode of the show,"" while the reference translation simply states ""a series.""
2. The machine translation uses ""ii"" instead of ""McMahon.""
3. The machine translation uses ""cm punk had his encounter with ii"" instead of ""CM Punk confronted McMahon.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The mention of ""one episode of the show"" adds unnecessary information that is not present in the reference translation.
2. The use of ""ii"" instead of ""McMahon"" is incorrect and changes the meaning of the sentence.
3. The phrase ""cm punk had his encounter with ii"" is not as clear or concise as ""CM Punk confronted McMahon.""

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the incorrect use of names, unnecessary information, and lack of clarity in the phrasing. The reference translation is more accurate and concise.

The source text seems to be talking about something growing by increasing its radical roots and plum buds after being planted in water or soil.

Machine translation: After planting it in water, or in clay, the radical roots increase, and the plumulus dacla.

The machine translation is somewhat accurate in conveying the idea of something growing by increasing its radical roots after being planted in water or clay. However, it has some issues:

1. The term ""plumulus dacla"" is not clear and seems to be a mistranslation or a mistake. The reference translation uses ""plum buds,"" which makes more sense in this context.
2. The machine translation does not mention the growth of plum buds, which is an essential part of the source text.

Reference translation: When it is soaked in water or planted in the soil , it grows by radical roots and plum buds .

The reference translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text. It mentions the growth of the subject by increasing its radical roots and plum buds when planted in water or soil.

In conclusion, the machine translation is partially accurate but has some issues, such as the unclear term ""plumulus dacla"" and the omission of the growth of plum buds. The reference translation is more accurate and better conveys the meaning of the source text. Therefore, the quality of the Nepali-English translation in the machine translation is not as good as the reference translation.

- Machine translation: ""this time of the eastern plain"" vs. Reference translation: ""this period of the Eastern epic""
- Machine translation: ""has been recognized as a depreciation"" vs. Reference translation: ""is known as the declining period""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation correctly captures the overall meaning of the source text, which is about recognizing a certain time period as a depreciation.
- However, the machine translation is less accurate in terms of specific word choices and phrasing. For example, ""this time of the eastern plain"" is not as precise as ""this period of the Eastern epic.""

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. ""Cedarlokes"" in the machine translation is not a correct translation of ""देवलोकहरू"" (higher worlds) in the source.
2. ""Punya"" in the reference translation is not translated in the machine translation.
3. ""Sadhana"" is translated correctly in both the machine and reference translations.

The source text is talking about a situation where a research problem cannot be resolved. In this case, the observation and review of literature help to focus attention.

Now, let's analyze the machine translation:

Machine translation: Or if the suspension problem cannot be resolved, the observation and review of the course helps to focus attention.

The machine translation is different from the source text in two ways:
1. It translates ""शोध समस्या"" as ""suspension problem"" instead of ""research problem.""
2. It translates ""साहित्यको अवलोकन र पुनरावलोकन"" as ""observation and review of the course"" instead of ""observation and review of the literature.""

Now, let's compare the machine translation with the reference translation:

Reference translation: Or if the research problem cannot be resolved, the observation and review of the literature helps to concentrate the attention.

The reference translation is more accurate than the machine translation because it correctly translates ""शोध समस्या"" as ""research problem"" and ""साहित्यको अवलोकन र पुनरावलोकन"" as ""observation and review of the literature.""

In conclusion, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation because it misinterprets the meaning of some key phrases in the source text. The reference translation provides a more accurate representation of the source text's meaning.

Source: मार्च १९९६मा शकीरा ""टूर पीएस देस्काल्जोस"" नामको आफ्नो पहिलो अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय यात्रामा निस्किईन।
Machine translation: In March 1996, Shakira went out on her first international journey under the name ""TUR PS Duscaljos"".
Reference translation: In March 1996 , Shakira embarked on her first international tour , the "" Tour Pies Descalzos "" .

Analysis:
1. Both the machine translation and reference translation correctly identify the month and year of the event (March 1996).
2. Both translations correctly identify the subject of the sentence, Shakira.
3. Both translations correctly identify the main action of the sentence, which is Shakira's first international journey or tour.
4. The machine translation uses the term ""international journey"" while the reference translation uses ""international tour."" Both terms are accurate, but the reference translation is more specific to the context of Shakira's music career.
5. The machine translation uses the name ""TUR PS Duscaljos"" for the tour, which is incorrect. The reference translation correctly translates the tour name as ""Tour Pies Descalzos.""
6. The machine translation uses the word ""went out"" to describe Shakira's action, while the reference translation uses ""embarked on."" Both phrases are accurate, but the reference translation is more fitting for the context of a tour.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has some errors in translating the tour name and using a less appropriate phrase for describing Shakira's action. The reference translation is more accurate and better suited to the context of Shakira's music career. Therefore, the quality of the Nepali-English translation is moderate, with room for improvement.

The source text is talking about the Sun's movement in a particular constellation during a specific time period.

Machine translation: Normally, the sun can be seen visiting this non - sun between 1st to 14th year of scientific interest.

Source: उनले देवकोटाको परिचयसहित यस उपन्यासको संरचनागत अध्ययन गरेका छन् ।
Machine translation: He has studied the structural theory of this novel, with the introduction of the codex.
Reference translation: He has done a structural study of this novel including the introduction of Devkota .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation mentions ""the introduction of the codex,"" while the reference translation mentions ""the introduction of Devkota.""
- The machine translation uses ""studied the structural theory,"" while the reference translation uses ""done a structural study.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""देवकोटा"" (Devkota) as ""the codex."" This is a significant error, as Devkota is a famous Nepali writer, and the codex is a term related to books.
- The machine translation also changes the verb phrase from ""done a structural study"" to ""studied the structural theory."" This changes the meaning slightly, as ""done a structural study"" implies a more comprehensive analysis, while ""studied the structural theory"" focuses on the theoretical aspects.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has some issues with accuracy and meaning. It incorrectly translates ""देवकोटा"" (Devkota) and changes the verb phrase, which affects the overall meaning. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is not high.

Reference translation: These Central Indian Hindu tribal systems are believed to be based on the lineage of the four sages Marichi , Angira , Atri and Vashishta .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""middle Indian"" while the reference translation uses ""Central Indian.""
2. The machine translation uses ""Hindu gotra laws"" while the reference translation uses ""Hindu tribal systems.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""middle Indian"" vs. ""Central Indian"" does not significantly impact the meaning, but ""Central Indian"" is more accurate.
2. The use of ""Hindu gotra laws"" vs. ""Hindu tribal systems"" changes the focus of the sentence. ""Hindu gotra laws"" refers to specific rules or laws, while ""Hindu tribal systems"" refers to a broader social or cultural system. This difference in focus may impact the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. The use of ""tribal traditions of marichi, Angira, Atri and vashishtha four debates"" vs. ""lineage of the four sages Marichi , Angira , Atri and Vashishta"" changes the context of the sentence. The machine translation refers to ""debates"" while the reference translation refers to ""sages."" This difference in context may impact the overall meaning of the sentence.

- The machine translation focuses on ""religious studies"" while the reference translation mentions ""literature"" and ""materials.""
- The machine translation uses ""To focus solely on"" while the reference translation uses ""By bearing this in mind.""
- The machine translation uses ""must be collected"" while the reference translation uses ""should be collected.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation misses the context of ""bearing this in mind,"" which is important in understanding the source's intention.
- The machine translation is more specific in mentioning ""religious studies,"" while the reference translation is broader by mentioning ""literature.""
- The machine translation uses ""must"" while the reference translation uses ""should,"" which changes the level of certainty in the translation.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is not of high quality because it misses the context of ""bearing this in mind"" and is more specific in mentioning ""religious studies"" instead of the broader ""literature."" Additionally, the use of ""must"" instead of ""should"" changes the level of certainty in the translation. The reference translation better captures the original meaning and context of the source.

Machine translation: The nearby community worships such as Jewshom, which is worshipped in the name of the goddess, dry, drought, and famine.

The machine translation is different from the source text in several ways. First, it incorrectly translates ""देवीदेवता"" as ""Jewshom,"" which is not a proper translation. Second, it does not mention the Newar community. Third, it does not mention the specific ritual called ""यज्ञहोम"" (Yagyahome). Lastly, it does not mention the times of drought, dryness, and famine when the ritual is performed.

1. The machine translation uses ""And it came to pass"" while the reference translation uses ""The people endured.""
2. The machine translation uses ""when the people had drawn up a year"" while the reference translation uses ""for a year.""
3. The machine translation omits ""looked forward and waited"" which is present in the reference translation.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The machine translation starts with ""And it came to pass,"" which is a less natural way to begin a sentence compared to ""The people endured.""
2. The use of ""drawn up a year"" in the machine translation is less clear than ""for a year"" in the reference translation.
3. The omission of ""looked forward and waited"" in the machine translation makes the translation less complete and less accurate compared to the reference translation.

Source: हाम्रो समाजमा अन्धविश्वास व्याप्त भएकाले सर्पले टोकेमा यस्ता कार्य गर्नुहुँदैन
Machine translation: That such action should not be done in the serpent token because of the blind interests in our society
Reference translation: As superstition is prevalent in our society , one should not do these types of things if a snake bites .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""serpent token"" while the reference translation uses ""if a snake bites.""
- The machine translation says ""because of the blind interests in our society"" while the reference translation says ""As superstition is prevalent in our society.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of ""serpent token"" is not clear and does not convey the same meaning as ""if a snake bites."" This makes the machine translation less accurate.
- The machine translation does not mention ""superstition"" which is an important aspect of the reference translation. This omission makes the machine translation less comprehensive.

Step 4: Conclusion
The quality of the machine translation is not very good. It does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and omits important information. The reference translation is more accurate and comprehensive in its translation.

Reference translation: The next night of that game , Ambrose played the first game since his 2017 , in which he managed to defeat Zigler .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation says ""Ambrose played the first game since his 2017 defeat to ziegler,"" while the reference translation says ""Ambrose played the first game since his 2017, in which he managed to defeat Zigler.""
2. The machine translation uses ""successfully lost"" while the reference translation uses ""managed to defeat.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The machine translation implies that Ambrose lost the game to Zigler in 2017, which is not accurate according to the source. The source states that Ambrose successfully defeated Zigler in the game.
2. The machine translation's use of ""successfully lost"" is a contradiction, as it implies that Ambrose both won and lost the game. The reference translation's use of ""managed to defeat"" accurately conveys that Ambrose was able to win against Zigler.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is of low quality because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The translation is confusing and contradictory, which can lead to misunderstandings. The reference translation is more accurate and clear in its meaning.

Machine translation: During Rana's reign, the question of language, religion, culture, and the question of development was a serious crime.
Reference translation: During the Rana rule , the question of preservation and development of language , religion , literature and culture was similar to grave crime .

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""Rana's reign"" while the reference translation uses ""Rana rule.""
2. The machine translation says ""the question of development"" while the reference translation says ""the question of preservation and development.""
3. The machine translation says ""was a serious crime"" while the reference translation says ""was similar to grave crime.""

Analysis:
The machine translation captures the general idea of the source text but has some inaccuracies. The use of ""Rana's reign"" instead of ""Rana rule"" is a minor difference in phrasing. The machine translation omits the aspect of ""preservation"" in the context of language, religion, literature, and culture, which is an important part of the source text. Additionally, the machine translation uses ""was a serious crime"" instead of ""was similar to grave crime,"" which slightly changes the emphasis of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has some minor inaccuracies and omissions compared to the reference translation.

Machine translation: So all the scenes were turning into the growth of Nepal.
Reference translation: Therefore , everyone 's eyes were on the prosperity of Nepal Mandal .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation says ""So all the scenes were turning into the growth of Nepal,"" while the reference translation says ""Therefore, everyone's eyes were on the prosperity of Nepal Mandal.""
- The machine translation omits the word ""therefore"" and the phrase ""everyone's eyes"" from the reference translation.
- The machine translation also omits the word ""Mandal"" from the source, which is present in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation captures the general idea of the source, which is about everyone's attention being on the growth or prosperity of Nepal.
- However, the machine translation omits some important details from the reference translation, such as ""therefore,"" ""everyone's eyes,"" and ""Mandal.""
- The omission of these details makes the machine translation less accurate and less faithful to the reference translation.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is not very high, as it omits important details from the reference translation. It captures the general idea of the source, but the omissions make it less accurate and less faithful to the reference translation.

Source: ऋग्वेदमा खास गरी औषधीको वर्णन गरिएको हुनाले यसलाई आयुर्वेद पनि भनिएको छ ।
Machine translation: Because the drug was described particularly in negotiations, it has also been called an aerial drug.
Reference translation: Because the drug was described particularly in Rigveda , it has also been called the Ayurveda .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""negotiations"" while the reference translation mentions ""Rigveda.""
2. The machine translation refers to the drug as an ""aerial drug,"" while the reference translation refers to it as ""Ayurveda.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""ऋग्वेद"" as ""negotiations"" instead of ""Rigveda."" This is a significant error, as Rigveda is a sacred text in Hinduism and is the primary source of information about the drug in the source text.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""औषधी"" as ""drug"" instead of ""Ayurveda."" This is another significant error, as Ayurveda is a system of traditional medicine originating in India and is the subject of the source text.
3. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""छ"" as ""has also been called"" instead of ""also been called."" This is a minor error, but it does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation has several significant errors that affect the overall quality of the translation. The incorrect translations of ""ऋग्वेद"" and ""औषधी"" lead to a loss of meaning and context in the translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: नेशनल रेस्लिङ एलायन्स देशभरका सबै क्षेत्रीय क्षेत्रहरु र टाढाको क्षेत्रमा जापानको पनि यो शासकीय निकाय रहेको थियो।
Machine translation: The National Reisling Alliance was also headquartered in this principality of Japan in all regional regions of the country and in a remote region.
Reference translation: The National Wrestling Alliance was also Japan 's governing body in all regions of the country and in remote areas .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""National Reisling Alliance"" while the reference translation mentions ""National Wrestling Alliance"".
2. The machine translation says the organization was ""headquartered"" in Japan, while the reference translation says it was Japan's ""governing body"".
3. The machine translation mentions ""all regional regions of the country"" while the reference translation simply says ""all regions of the country"".
4. The machine translation mentions a ""remote region"" while the reference translation mentions ""remote areas"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The name of the organization is incorrect in the machine translation. It should be ""National Wrestling Alliance"" instead of ""National Reisling Alliance"". This is a significant error as it changes the subject of the sentence.
2. The term ""headquartered"" does not accurately convey the idea of the organization being the governing body of Japan. The reference translation more accurately captures this idea with ""governing body"".
3. The phrase ""all regional regions of the country"" is redundant and less clear than ""all regions of the country"". The reference translation is more concise and clear.
4. The term ""remote region"" is less specific than ""remote areas"". The reference translation more accurately conveys the idea that the organization had authority in multiple remote areas.

Conclusion: The machine translation has several inaccuracies and lacks clarity compared to the reference translation. The quality of the machine translation is poor.

Machine translation: The Tamangs would make a name of the dead after his siege on someone's death vault, and as such the tamang village appears abundantly on the sides of the mountain.
Reference translation: Tamangs build chaityas in the name of the deceased after their death and such chaityas can be found in abundance in the hills surrounding Tamang village .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""someone's death vault"" while the reference translation mentions ""the deceased."" The reference translation is more accurate as it refers to the person who has passed away, not someone else's death vault.
2. The machine translation uses the phrase ""his siege"" which is not accurate. The correct term should be ""their death"" as mentioned in the reference translation.
3. The machine translation mentions ""the tamang village appears abundantly on the sides of the mountain,"" which is not accurate. The correct phrase should be ""such chaityas can be found in abundance in the hills surrounding Tamang village,"" as mentioned in the reference translation.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation has several inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The use of incorrect terms and phrases, such as ""someone's death vault"" and ""his siege,"" make the machine translation less accurate than the reference translation. Additionally, the machine translation does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation regarding the location of the chaityas.

Machine translation: These agencies should not be registered as separate agencies in participation.
Reference translation: These bodies do not need to be registered with the department as exempt bodies .

Step 2: Identify the key differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""agencies"" while the reference translation uses ""bodies.""
2. The machine translation says ""should not be registered as separate agencies in participation"" while the reference translation says ""do not need to be registered with the department as exempt bodies.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""agencies"" and ""bodies"" can be considered a minor difference, as both terms refer to organizations or groups. However, ""bodies"" is more specific in the context of the source, as it refers to organizations within a specific department.
2. The machine translation's phrasing ""should not be registered as separate agencies in participation"" is less clear than the reference translation's ""do not need to be registered with the department as exempt bodies."" The machine translation does not convey the idea that these organizations are exempt from registration.

Machine translation: However, Gandhi has said in his obituary that he was never worthy of this honour.
Reference translation: However , Gandhi said in his autobiography that he never felt that he was worthy of this honor .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""obituary"" while the reference translation uses ""autobiography.""
2. The machine translation says ""he was never worthy of this honour"" while the reference translation says ""he never felt that he was worthy of this honor.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""obituary"" instead of ""autobiography"" changes the context of the statement. An obituary is a brief biographical notice of a deceased person, while an autobiography is a self-written account of one's life. This difference in context may lead to confusion for the reader.
2. The machine translation's phrasing ""he was never worthy of this honour"" is more definitive than the reference translation's ""he never felt that he was worthy of this honor."" The latter phrasing suggests that Gandhi had doubts about his worthiness, while the former suggests that he was objectively unworthy. This difference in tone and certainty may also lead to confusion for the reader.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of high quality because it introduces confusion by using the wrong term (obituary instead of autobiography) and by changing the tone and certainty of Gandhi's statement.

 To evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation, we need to compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify the differences.

Source: मन्दिरको निमार्ण सम्बत १८८२मा भएको कुरा मन्दिरमा रहेको शिलापत्रमा उल्लेख छ।
Machine translation: The Temple is mentioned in the shrine at the temple which was inaugurated in 1882.
Reference translation: It is mentioned in the inscription od the temple that the construction of the temple was done in 1882 AD .

Differences:
1. The machine translation mentions ""the shrine at the temple"" while the reference translation mentions ""the inscription of the temple."" The source text does not explicitly mention ""shrine"" or ""inscription,"" so this difference is not due to a direct translation error.
2. The machine translation states that the temple was ""inaugurated"" in 1882, while the reference translation states that the ""construction of the temple was done"" in 1882. The source text does not explicitly mention ""inauguration"" or ""construction,"" so this difference is not due to a direct translation error.
3. The machine translation does not mention ""1882 AD,"" which is present in the reference translation. This omission may be due to the machine translation not capturing the exact meaning of the source text.

Overall, the machine translation is not entirely accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. It has some differences in phrasing and omits important information (1882 AD). The quality of the Nepali-English translation can be considered poor.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: यी जन्जिरबाट मुक्ति पाउनको लागि एक मात्र तरिका छ कि हामी प्राकृतिक आदिम अवस्था व्यवस्थामा फर्कौ ।
Machine translation: Only one way to get rid of these births is that we return to the natural etymological conditions.
Reference translation: The only way to get rid of these chains is to return to the natural primitive state system.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation says ""get rid of these births"" while the reference translation says ""get rid of these chains."" The source text uses the word ""जन्जिर"" which can mean ""chains"" or ""bonds"" in English, but the machine translation incorrectly translates it as ""births.""
- The machine translation says ""natural etymological conditions"" while the reference translation says ""natural primitive state system."" The source text uses the words ""प्राकृतिक"" and ""आदिम अवस्था व्यवस्था,"" which can be translated as ""natural primitive state system."" The machine translation incorrectly translates ""प्राकृतिक"" as ""etymological,"" which is not accurate.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not accurate because it misinterprets the meaning of the source text. It incorrectly translates ""जन्जिर"" as ""births"" and ""प्राकृतिक"" as ""etymological."" The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the meaning of the source text.

Quality evaluation: The machine translation is of low quality because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is of high quality as it correctly interprets the meaning of the source text.

Machine translation: Although he was chosen from the Midwest for the National Sports, he lost the opportunity after a problem with health.
Reference translation: Although he was chosen in Volleyball from the Midwest for the National Sports , he lost the opportunity after a problem with health .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation does not mention the sport (Volleyball) that the person was chosen for.
2. The machine translation uses ""he"" while the reference translation uses ""he"" and ""the opportunity"" to refer to the person.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it omits the specific sport (Volleyball) that the person was chosen for. This omission makes the machine translation slightly less informative than the reference translation. Additionally, the machine translation's use of ""he"" and ""the opportunity"" to refer to the person is not as clear as the reference translation's use of ""he"" and the specific sport.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good but could be improved by including the specific sport and using clearer pronoun references.

468	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: प्रकृति र भौतिकता फरक ध्रुवका पदार्थ भएको हुनाले प्रकृतिको गतिअनुरूप भौतिकता परिवर्तन हुन सक्दैन ।
Machine translation: Because Nature and physiology are different polarities, physiology cannot be changed by the speed of nature.
Reference translation: Because nature and materiality are substance of different poles , materiality cannot change according to the motion of nature .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""physiology"" while the reference translation uses ""materiality.""
2. The machine translation says ""physiology cannot be changed by the speed of nature"" while the reference translation says ""materiality cannot change according to the motion of nature.""
3. The machine translation uses ""different polarities"" while the reference translation uses ""substance of different poles.""

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.

1. The use of ""physiology"" instead of ""materiality"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""physiology"" refers to the physical and functional aspects of an organism, while ""materiality"" refers to the substance or matter of something.
2. The machine translation's phrasing suggests that physiology is unchangeable due to nature's speed, while the reference translation emphasizes that materiality cannot change in accordance with nature's motion. The machine translation's phrasing is less accurate and less clear than the reference translation.
3. The use of ""different polarities"" instead of ""substance of different poles"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""polarities"" refers to opposing forces or extremes, while ""substance of different poles"" refers to different types of matter or material.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of lower quality than the reference translation due to the differences in meaning and clarity. The machine translation's use of ""physiology,"" ""different polarities,"" and its phrasing about the relationship between nature and physiology/materiality result in a less accurate and less clear translation.

Source: रोमन क्याथोलिक चर्चको दवावपूर्ण विरोध हुँदाहुँदै स्पेनले वैवाहिक समानतालाई मान्यता दिने गरी कानुन बनायो ।
Machine translation: During the suppression of the Roman Catholic Church, Spain made laws regarding religious equality.
Reference translation: Spain made a law to give equal recognition to marriage despite strong criticism of Roman Catholic churches.

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""suppression of the Roman Catholic Church,"" while the reference translation mentions ""strong criticism of Roman Catholic churches."" The source text does not explicitly mention suppression or criticism, so both translations are making assumptions.
2. The machine translation focuses on ""religious equality"" as the main theme, while the reference translation emphasizes ""equal recognition to marriage."" The source text does not explicitly mention marriage, so the reference translation is making an assumption.
3. The machine translation does not mention the specific law that was made, while the reference translation does. The source text does not provide enough information to determine if a specific law was made, so both translations are making assumptions.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not entirely accurate, as it makes assumptions about the suppression of the Roman Catholic Church and the focus on religious equality. Additionally, it does not mention the specific law that was made. However, it does capture the general idea of Spain making laws during a time of conflict with the Roman Catholic Church.

Step 5: Provide a final evaluation.

The quality of the machine translation is moderate. It captures the general idea of the source text but makes assumptions and omits important details. The reference translation is more accurate, as it focuses on the equal recognition of marriage and mentions the specific law made by Spain.

Machine translation: Registrar of the department within seven days of registration of liquidator appointments
Reference translation: Registrar of the Department within seven days of registration of application for appointment of Liquidator

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""department"" while the reference translation uses ""Department.""
2. The machine translation uses ""liquidator appointments"" while the reference translation uses ""application for appointment of Liquidator.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The difference in capitalization of ""department"" does not significantly impact the meaning or quality of the translation.
2. The machine translation omits the phrase ""for appointment of Liquidator"" which is present in the reference translation. This omission changes the meaning of the sentence, as it does not specify that the registrar is responsible for registering the application for the appointment of a liquidator.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation because it omits important information that changes the meaning of the sentence. The quality of the machine translation is therefore lower than the reference translation.

541	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: २०१२ माघ १० र ११मा विरगन्जमा सुवर्णशमशेरलाई सभापति बनाई नेपाली कांग्रेसको छैठौँ महाअधिवेशन सम्पन्न भयो।
Machine translation: In 2012, 10 and 11 were elected to the sixth Congress of the Nepali Congress, making goldsmiths chair in wirganj.
Reference translation: The 6th General Convention of the Nepali Congress was held in Birgunj on 10 and 11 Magh 2012 with Suvarna Shumsher as the chairman .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""goldsmiths chair in wirganj"" while the reference translation mentions ""Suvarna Shumsher as the chairman.""
2. The machine translation says ""2012, 10 and 11"" while the reference translation says ""10 and 11 Magh 2012.""
3. The machine translation uses ""wirganj"" while the reference translation uses ""Birgunj.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""सुवर्णशमशेर"" (Suvarna Shumsher) as ""goldsmiths chair,"" which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly identifies Suvarna Shumsher as the chairman.
2. The machine translation incorrectly translates the date format. The reference translation correctly mentions ""10 and 11 Magh 2012.""
3. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""विरगन्जमा"" (in Birgunj) as ""wirganj,"" which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly identifies the location as Birgunj.

Conclusion: The machine translation has several inaccuracies and is not of high quality. The reference translation is more accurate and should be considered the better translation.

Machine translation: Both of these changes can result in an increase in pulmonary rhythms, which can generate a core pulmonel.
Reference translation: These two changes results in increased blood pressure in pulmunary valves , which creates core pulmonale .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""pulmonary rhythms"" while the reference translation mentions ""blood pressure in pulmunary valves.""
2. The machine translation uses the term ""core pulmonel"" while the reference translation uses ""core pulmonale.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The mention of ""pulmonary rhythms"" instead of ""blood pressure in pulmunary valves"" is a significant error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. Pulmonary rhythms refer to a variation in blood pressure and heart rate, while blood pressure in pulmunary valves is more specific to the context of the source.
2. The term ""core pulmonel"" is incorrect and does not match the reference translation. The correct term is ""core pulmonale,"" which refers to a condition where the pressure in the pulmonary circulation is elevated, leading to right-sided heart failure.

Step 4: Conclusion

The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the significant errors in meaning and terminology. The machine translation does not accurately convey the information from the source and is different from the reference translation in terms of both meaning and terminology.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: भनिन्छ कि हैहयवंशको अन्त गर्नाको लागी स्वयं भगवानले परशुरामको रूपमा अंशावतार ग्रहण गरेका थिए ।
Machine translation: It is said that the cost of ending the haihyavats itself was accepted by the goddess as a tradition.
Reference translation: It is said that in order to end Haihayabansa , God himself had incarnated in the form of Parshuram .

Step 2: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""the cost of ending the haihyavats"" while the reference translation mentions ""in order to end Haihayabansa"". The machine translation seems to misinterpret the source text, as it does not mention the cost but rather the incarnation of God.
2. The machine translation mentions ""the goddess"" while the reference translation mentions ""God himself"". The source text does not specify the gender of the deity, so both translations are not entirely accurate in this regard.
3. The machine translation mentions ""accepted as a tradition"" while the reference translation mentions ""had incarnated in the form of Parshuram"". The machine translation seems to misinterpret the source text, as it does not mention incarnation but rather acceptance as a tradition.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is not accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. It misinterprets the source text in several ways, leading to a translation that is not consistent with the original meaning.

Step 4: Provide a recommendation for improvement.

A better machine translation would be: ""It is said that in order to end Haihayabansa, God himself incarnated in the form of Parshuram."" This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is consistent with the reference translation.

 To evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation, I will first read and understand the source text, then compare it with the machine translation and reference translation.

Source: संस्कृत भाषा बाहुनले मात्र पढ्ने भाषा नभएर सबै जातजातिले पढ्ने व्यवस्था समेत भयो।

Translation: There was a provision where Sanskrit was not only a language to be studied by the Brahmins only but also by all ethnicities.

Now, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

Machine translation: The colloquial language excluded not only the reading language, but all the ethnic languages included the law of reading.

Reference translation: Provision was made where Sanskrit was not only a language to be studied by the Brahmins only but also by all ethnicity.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the following ways:

1. The machine translation mentions ""colloquial language"" while the reference translation talks about ""Sanskrit.""
2. The machine translation states that the colloquial language excluded not only the reading language but also all the ethnic languages, which is not mentioned in the source text or the reference translation.
3. The machine translation does not mention the provision being made for Sanskrit to be studied by all ethnicities.

Based on these differences, the machine translation does not accurately represent the source text and is not as close to the reference translation as it should be. The quality of the Nepali-English translation in this case is poor.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: श्रीस्थान पञ्चकोशी अंतर्गत पर्ने पाँच स्थान मध्यको एक स्थान हो।
Machine translation: Mr. Space is a place among the five places to be under the panchkoshi agency.
Reference translation: Shristhan is one of the place among the five places of panchakoshi .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation has ""Mr. Space"" while the reference translation has ""Shristhan"".
- The machine translation has ""to be under the panchkoshi agency"" while the reference translation has ""of panchakoshi"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""श्रीस्थान"" as ""Mr. Space"" instead of ""Shristhan"". This is a significant error as it changes the meaning of the sentence.
- The machine translation adds unnecessary information with ""to be under the panchkoshi agency"" which is not present in the source or reference translation. This makes the machine translation less accurate.

Step 4: Conclusion
The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the incorrect translation of ""श्रीस्थान"" and the addition of unnecessary information. The reference translation is more accurate and closer to the source.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: While normally held, some activity of the moon is likely to be arranged.
Reference translation: In general , some of Rup Chandra 's activities seem anarchist .

Step 2: Identify the key differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""some activity of the moon"" while the reference translation mentions ""some of Rup Chandra 's activities.""
2. The machine translation uses the phrase ""likely to be arranged"" while the reference translation uses ""seem anarchist.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""रूपचन्द्रका केही क्रियाकलाप"" as ""some activity of the moon"" instead of ""some of Rup Chandra 's activities."" This is a significant error as it changes the subject of the sentence from Rup Chandra's activities to the moon's activities.
2. The machine translation uses ""likely to be arranged"" which is a more passive and uncertain phrase compared to the reference translation's ""seem anarchist."" The reference translation conveys a stronger sense of the activities being anarchist, while the machine translation is less assertive.

Step 4: Conclusion

The quality of the machine translation is poor due to the incorrect translation of the subject and the use of a less assertive and less accurate phrase. The reference translation more accurately captures the meaning of the source text.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: तर, धेरै सामाजिक मूल्य, मान्यतामा सामिप्यता रहेको छ।
Machine translation: Nevertheless, many social prices, have been sampered in the assumption.
Reference translation: However , there is similarity in many social values ​ ​ and beliefs .

Step 2: Identify the key differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- The machine translation uses the term ""social prices"" instead of ""social values.""
- The machine translation uses the term ""sampered"" instead of ""similarity.""
- The machine translation uses the term ""assumption"" instead of ""beliefs.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

- The use of ""social prices"" instead of ""social values"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""prices"" refers to the cost of something, while ""values"" refer to the importance or worth of something.
- The use of ""sampered"" instead of ""similarity"" is incorrect, as ""sampered"" is not a word in English and does not convey the intended meaning.
- The use of ""assumption"" instead of ""beliefs"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""assumption"" refers to a statement or proposition that is accepted as true without proof, while ""beliefs"" refer to the opinions or convictions that someone has.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Based on the analysis, the machine translation is of low quality because it contains multiple inaccuracies and changes the intended meaning of the source text. The translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text, and the use of incorrect or unclear words further detracts from the quality of the translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: माघे सङ्क्रान्तिको अघिल्लो दिन अर्थात् पुसको अन्तिम दिन घर घरमा सुँगुर काट्ने चलन छ, जसलाई 'जिता मरना दिन' भनिन्छ ।
Machine translation: The previous day of the demolition, or the last day of the push, is a variant of the pig cut into the house, which is called 'Zita Merana day'.
Reference translation: On the last day of Maghe Sankranti , i.e. the last day of Poush , it is customary to slaughter pigs at home , which is called ' Jita Marana Din ' .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation mentions ""the previous day of the demolition"" and ""the last day of the push,"" which are not present in the source or reference translation.
2. The machine translation uses the term ""Zita Merana day"" instead of ""Jita Marana Din.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The mention of ""the previous day of the demolition"" and ""the last day of the push"" is incorrect and not present in the source or reference translation. This shows that the machine translation has misunderstood the context of the source text.
2. The use of ""Zita Merana day"" instead of ""Jita Marana Din"" is a mistranslation. This shows that the machine translation has not accurately translated the term from the source language to the target language.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor, as it has misunderstood the context of the source text and has mistranslated certain terms. The reference translation is more accurate and provides a better representation of the source text.

Source: त्यसैले उनलाई वैद्धिक कालमा मन्त्रद्रष्टा भनेर चिनिन्थ्यो ।
Machine translation: So he was known as a mechanic in the philosophical era.
Reference translation: Therefore , he was known as a mantra seer in the Vedic period .

Step 2: Identify the key differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. Machine translation: mechanic - Reference translation: mantra seer
2. Machine translation: philosophical era - Reference translation: Vedic period

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The term ""mechanic"" is not an accurate translation of ""मन्त्रद्रष्टा"" (mantra seer) in the context of the source. A mantra seer is someone who has knowledge of and can recite mantras, which is not the same as a mechanic.
2. The term ""philosophical era"" is not an accurate translation of ""वैद्धिक काल"" (Vedic period). The Vedic period refers to a specific time period in ancient Indian history, while the philosophical era is a more general term that could refer to any time period with a focus on philosophy.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is not accurate in capturing the meaning of the source text. The key differences in the translation (mechanic vs. mantra seer and philosophical era vs. Vedic period) result in a translation that does not convey the intended meaning of the source text. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is poor.

739	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: परशुरामले रचना गरेको धनुष चन्द्रोदय नाम गरेको ग्रन्थमा ६० हजार श्लोक छन् ।
Machine translation: There are 60 thousand shloks in a grant named bow chandroshan, constructed by parshuram.
Reference translation: There are 60 thousand verses in the book called Dhanush Chandrodaya composed by Parashuram.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses the term ""grant"" instead of ""book.""
- The machine translation uses the term ""constructed"" instead of ""composed.""
- The machine translation uses the term ""shloks"" instead of ""verses.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The term ""grant"" is not appropriate in this context, as the source is referring to a book, not a land or property grant.
- The term ""constructed"" is not appropriate, as it implies that Parashuram built something physical, while the source is referring to a literary work.
- The term ""shloks"" is a more accurate translation of ""श्लोक"" than ""verses,"" as ""श्लोक"" specifically refers to a couplet in Sanskrit poetry. However, the term ""verses"" is more commonly used in English to refer to lines of poetry or sections of a religious text.

Step 4: Determine the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is partially accurate, as it correctly identifies the number of ""shloks"" and the author, Parashuram. However, it contains several inaccuracies in the choice of words, which affect the overall quality of the translation. The machine translation would benefit from using more appropriate terms such as ""book"" instead of ""grant,"" ""composed"" instead of ""constructed,"" and ""verses"" instead of ""shloks.""
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: पुनरुक्तिहरू र मात्रागत विचलनलाई पनि शैली विज्ञानले सकारात्मक विशेषताका रूपमा लिएको
Machine translation: Restorations and amount of deficiency also taken by style science as a positive feature
Reference translation: Repetitions and quantitative deviations are also taken as positive features by stylistics

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses the term ""Restorations"" while the reference translation uses ""Repetitions.""
2. The machine translation uses the term ""amount of deficiency"" while the reference translation uses ""quantitative deviations.""
3. The machine translation uses the term ""style science"" while the reference translation uses ""stylistics.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The term ""Restorations"" is not an accurate translation of ""पुनरुक्तिहरू"" (repetitions) in the source. The machine translation should have used ""Repetitions"" instead.
2. The term ""amount of deficiency"" is not an accurate translation of ""मात्रागत विचलन"" (quantitative deviations) in the source. The machine translation should have used ""quantitative deviations"" instead.
3. The term ""style science"" is not a standard term in English. The reference translation uses ""stylistics,"" which is a more accurate and standard term in English for the study of literary style.

Step 4: Conclusion

The machine translation is not of high quality because it does not accurately translate the source text into English. The machine translation should have used ""Repetitions"" instead of ""Restorations,"" ""quantitative deviations"" instead of ""amount of deficiency,"" and ""stylistics"" instead of ""style science.""

Reference translation: Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was married to Saiwai Nimbaler on 14 May 1640 at Lalmahal .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation mentions ""the sixth shivaji maharaj"" while the reference translation simply says ""Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.""
- The machine translation says ""was held in lalmah with siwai following"" while the reference translation says ""was married to Saiwai Nimbaler on 14 May 1640 at Lalmahal.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The mention of ""the sixth shivaji maharaj"" in the machine translation is incorrect as Shivaji Maharaj was the first Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire and there is no mention of him being the sixth in the source.
- The phrase ""was held in lalmah with siwai following"" in the machine translation is unclear and does not accurately convey the information from the source. The reference translation, on the other hand, clearly states that Shivaji Maharaj was married to Saiwai Nimbaler on 14 May 1640 at Lalmahal.

- The machine translation uses ""aaphne company"" while the reference translation uses ""his own company.""
- The machine translation uses ""echo era"" while the reference translation uses ""competitor's area.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of ""illustrated"" instead of ""admitted"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""illustrated"" implies creating a visual representation, while ""admitted"" implies allowing someone to join or enter.
- The use of ""aaphne company"" instead of ""his own company"" is a mistranslation. ""Aaphne"" is not a correct translation for ""his own"" in this context.
- The use of ""echo era"" instead of ""competitor's area"" is also a mistranslation. ""Echo era"" does not convey the same meaning as ""competitor's area.""

- The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text is discussing the moisture content of grain, not the type of grain or the smell of a spark.
- The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text is discussing the smell of fat in grain with low moisture content, not the smell of a spark.
- The machine translation omits important information from the source text, such as ""moisture content.""

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
Based on the analysis, the quality of the machine translation is poor. It does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and omits important information.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

757	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 To evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation, we need to compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify the differences.

1. Source: सन् १९८८मा मेजर पदमा बढुवा भएपछि एक उच्च पदमा रहेका जनरल रोड्रिगेज ओचोआले चाभेजलाई मन पराउन थाले र काराकसमा आफ्नो सहयोगीको रूपमा नियुक्त गरे ।

Machine translation: After growing up in a major post in 1988, a highly regarded junior Rodrigues Ochoa began to favor chávez and was appointed as his assistant at caracus.

Reference translation: After being promoted to position of major in 1988 , General Rodrigej Ochao who is in higher position started liking Chavez and was appointed as his assitant at Carcus .

2. Differences:

a. ""Growing up in a major post"" vs. ""being promoted to the position of major"": The machine translation uses ""growing up in a major post"" which is not accurate. The correct phrase is ""being promoted to the position of major"" as mentioned in the reference translation.

b. ""A highly regarded junior Rodrigues Ochoa"" vs. ""General Rodrigej Ochao who is in a higher position"": The machine translation uses ""a highly regarded junior Rodrigues Ochoa"" which is not accurate. The correct phrase is ""General Rodrigej Ochao who is in a higher position"" as mentioned in the reference translation.

c. ""Began to favor chávez"" vs. ""started liking Chavez"": The machine translation uses ""began to favor chávez"" which is not accurate. The correct phrase is ""started liking Chavez"" as mentioned in the reference translation.

d. ""Was appointed as his assistant at caracus"" vs. ""was appointed as his assitant at Carcus"": The machine translation uses ""caracus"" instead of ""Carcus."" The correct spelling is ""Carcus"" as mentioned in the reference translation.

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not accurate and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The quality of the Nepali-English translation is poor.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

758	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the Nepali-English translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: डाँडी गीतमा वाक्क दिक्क भएर बसेकाहरू झुमरी गीतको नाच आरम्भ गर्ने बित्तिकै फेरी तरङ्गित हुन थाल्छन् ।
Machine translation: The waking in the mountain song is waved again as they initiate the dance of the bhumari song.
Reference translation: Those fed up with Dandi song get excited immediately after beginning of dance of Jhumari song .

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

- Machine translation: ""The waking in the mountain song is waved again as they initiate the dance of the bhumari song.""
- Reference translation: ""Those fed up with Dandi song get excited immediately after beginning of dance of Jhumari song.""

Differences:
1. The machine translation mentions ""waking in the mountain song"" while the reference translation mentions ""Dandi song.""
2. The machine translation mentions ""bhumari song"" while the reference translation mentions ""Jhumari song.""
3. The machine translation says ""waved again"" while the reference translation says ""get excited immediately after beginning.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The mention of ""waking in the mountain song"" is not accurate as the source text does not mention anything about a mountain song. The reference translation correctly identifies the Dandi song.
2. The mention of ""bhumari song"" is not accurate as the source text does not mention anything about a bhumari song. The reference translation correctly identifies the Jhumari song.
3. The machine translation's use of ""waved again"" does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text, which is about people getting excited immediately after the beginning of the dance.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and has significant differences from the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 To evaluate the quality of the Nepali-English translation, I will first read and understand the source text, then compare the machine translation and reference translation to identify any differences.

Source: बज्रांग र बाझांग एकै भए जस्तै ताराकसुर र खपरे/दाड़ेमष्ट एकै हुन् ।
This sentence in Nepali is talking about the similarity between two pairs of words: Bajrang and Bajhang, and Taraksur and Khapare / Dademasht.

Machine translation: Bajrang and bajhang are the same as starakshur and dhupre / Dadhimast.
In the machine translation, the sentence structure is slightly different, and it has translated ""starakshur"" and ""dhupre"" instead of ""Taraksur"" and ""Khapare / Dademasht"".

Reference translation: As Bajrang and Bajhang are the same , Taraksur and Khapare / Dademasht are the same .
The reference translation correctly identifies the similarity between the two pairs of words and maintains the same sentence structure as the source text.

Analysis:
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of sentence structure and the translation of the words ""Taraksur"" and ""Khapare / Dademasht"". The machine translation has translated ""starakshur"" and ""dhupre"" instead of the correct words from the source text. This difference in translation may lead to confusion for the reader.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is not as good as the reference translation. The reference translation is more accurate and maintains the same sentence structure as the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.
