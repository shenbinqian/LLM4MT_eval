 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, I will first read the source, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation to determine the quality of the machine translation.

Source: Jerry York, 71, American businessman, Executive Director of Apple Inc., cerebral hemorrhage.
Machine translation: 71 岁的杰瑞 · 约克, 美国商人, 苹果公司执行董事, 脑出血.
Reference translation: 71岁的杰瑞·约克,美国商人,苹果公司执行董事,脑出血.

Upon reading the source, machine translation, and reference translation, I can see that the machine translation is almost identical to the reference translation. The only difference is the use of a space before the comma in the machine translation, which is not a significant error.

Therefore, I would say that the quality of the English-Chinese translation is high, as the machine translation is very close to the reference translation and accurately conveys the meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

1	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: On 7 September Necker forbade the export of grain.
Machine translation: 9 月 7 日 ， 内克禁止粮食出口。
Reference translation: 9月7日，内克（Necker）禁止谷物的出口。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""9 月 7 日"" while the reference translation uses ""9月7日"" for the date.
- The machine translation uses ""内克禁止粮食出口"" while the reference translation uses ""内克（Necker）禁止谷物的出口"" for the main action.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the date format is minor and does not affect the overall meaning of the sentence.
- The difference in the main action is more significant. The machine translation uses ""粮食"" (grain) while the reference translation uses ""谷物"" (grain/cereal) and includes Necker's name in parentheses. This difference makes the machine translation less accurate than the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor issues that make it less accurate than the reference translation. The date format and the main action are slightly different, which could cause confusion for some readers. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by following the reference translation more closely.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, we need to compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify the differences.

Source: Ruler of Italy since 493, Theoderic became king of the Visigoths in 511 and exerted hegemony over the Vandals in North Africa between 521 and 523.

Machine translation: 自 493 年以来 ， 意大利统治者西奥德里克于 511 年成为维希戈特人的国王 ， 并在 521 年至 523 年期间对北非的破坏者实行霸权。

Reference translation: Theoderic自493年起成为意大利的统治者，于511年成为西哥特人的国王，并在521年至523年之间霸占了北非的Vandals。

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""破坏者"" (destroyers) to refer to the Vandals, while the reference translation uses ""Vandals"" directly. The machine translation is less accurate in this case, as it does not use the proper name for the group.

2. The machine translation uses ""对北非的破坏者实行霸权"" (exerted hegemony over the destroyers in North Africa) while the reference translation uses ""霸占了北非的Vandals"" (occupied the Vandals in North Africa). The machine translation is less accurate here, as it does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation.

3. The machine translation uses ""521 年至 523 年期间"" (during the period of 521 to 523) while the reference translation uses ""521年至523年之间"" (between 521 and 523). Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation is more concise.

Overall, the machine translation is less accurate than the reference translation, as it does not use the proper name for the Vandals and does not convey the same meaning in the second difference. However, the machine translation is still understandable and conveys the main ideas of the source text.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: The Tihamah ends abruptly at the escarpment of the western highlands.
Machine translation: 提哈玛河突然在西部高地的吞没处结束.
Reference translation: 提哈玛河（Tihamah）在西部高地的陡峭处突然终止。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""提哈玛河"" (Tihamah) directly, while the reference translation uses ""提哈玛河（Tihamah）"" with parentheses.
- The machine translation uses ""吞没处"" (in a swallowed place) for ""escarpment,"" while the reference translation uses ""陡峭处"" (in a steep place).
- The machine translation uses ""结束"" (end) for ""ends abruptly,"" while the reference translation uses ""突然终止"" (suddenly terminate).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of ""提哈玛河"" without parentheses is a minor issue, as it does not change the meaning of the sentence.
- The use of ""吞没处"" instead of ""陡峭处"" is a more significant issue, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. ""吞没处"" implies that the Tihamah ends in a place that has been swallowed or swallowed up, which is not the intended meaning. ""陡峭处"" more accurately conveys the idea that the Tihamah ends abruptly at the edge of a steep cliff.
- The use of ""结束"" instead of ""突然终止"" is a minor issue, as both phrases convey the idea of the Tihamah ending abruptly. However, ""突然终止"" more accurately captures the sense of suddenness in the source text.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has some issues with word choice that affect the meaning of the sentence. The quality of the machine translation is moderate.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Reference translation: 1916年7月，金凯德（Kinkaid）向海军最新的战列舰报导，担任枪炮侦察员。

Differences:
1. The machine translation omits the name ""Kinkaid"" in the sentence, while the reference translation includes it.
2. The machine translation uses ""战舰"" (battleship) to translate ""battleship,"" while the reference translation uses ""战列舰"" (battleship) to translate ""battleship.""
3. The machine translation uses ""炮火的发现者"" (gunfire spotter) to translate ""gunfire spotter,"" while the reference translation uses ""枪炮侦察员"" (artillery spotter) to translate ""gunfire spotter.""

Analysis:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences compared to the reference translation. The omission of the name ""Kinkaid"" is a minor issue, but the difference in the translation of ""battleship"" and ""gunfire spotter"" could lead to some confusion. The machine translation uses ""战舰"" (battleship) instead of ""战列舰"" (battleship), which might not be as specific as the reference translation. Additionally, the machine translation uses ""炮火的发现者"" (gunfire spotter) instead of ""枪炮侦察员"" (artillery spotter), which could lead to a slight difference in meaning. Overall, the machine translation is of good quality, but there are some minor inaccuracies compared to the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: The crust of limestone of Beauce ends with a ledge at the edge of the Bois de Verrières.
Machine translation: 波斯石灰石的结壳在贝里耶尔河的边缘有一个石块。
Reference translation: 博斯（Beauce）的石灰岩外壳在BoisdeVerrières的边缘处有一个壁架。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 波斯石灰石的结壳在贝里耶尔河的边缘有一个石块。
- Reference translation: 博斯（Beauce）的石灰岩外壳在BoisdeVerrières的边缘处有一个壁架。

Differences:
1. Machine translation uses 波斯 (Bos) while the reference translation uses 博斯 (Beauce) for the name of the region.
2. Machine translation uses 贝里耶尔河 (Bois de Verrières River) while the reference translation uses BoisdeVerrières (name of the location).
3. Machine translation uses 一个石块 (a stone block) while the reference translation uses 一个壁架 (a ledge).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The name of the region: This is a minor difference, as 波斯 (Bos) is a phonetic approximation of 博斯 (Beauce). The machine translation is still understandable.
2. The name of the location: This is a significant difference, as the machine translation incorrectly identifies Bois de Verrières as a river instead of a location. This affects the overall meaning of the sentence.
3. The description of the feature: This is a minor difference, as both translations convey the same meaning, but the machine translation uses a less specific term (石块, stone block) while the reference translation uses a more specific term (壁架, ledge).

Conclusion: The machine translation is of moderate quality. It captures the general meaning of the source text but has some inaccuracies in the specific details. The name of the location and the description of the feature are not translated correctly, which affects the overall quality of the translation.

Reference translation: 1938年3月，希特勒吞并了奥地利，这使哈利法克斯热衷于重整军备。

Now let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""希特勒 1938 年 3 月吞并奥地利使哈利法克斯更加热衷于重新武装"" which translates to ""Hitler's annexation of Austria in March 1938 made Halifax keener on rearmament."" The reference translation uses ""1938年3月，希特勒吞并了奥地利，这使哈利法克斯热衷于重整军备"" which translates to ""In March 1938, when Hitler annexed Austria, Halifax became eager to rearm.""

2. The machine translation places the subject ""哈利法克斯"" (Halifax) after the verb ""更加热衷于"" (keener on), while the reference translation places it after the verb ""热衷于"" (eager to).

3. The machine translation uses ""重新武装"" (rearmament) which is a direct translation of the English term, while the reference translation uses ""重整军备"" (reorganize military preparations), which is a more accurate translation of the original source.

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation has slightly different wording for the time and location, but the meaning is still clear.
2. The machine translation uses the verb ""参加了比赛"" (participated in the competition) to describe Tweddle's action, while the reference translation uses the verb ""参加了"" (participated in) without specifying the competition. This is a minor difference, and both translations convey the same meaning.
3. The machine translation uses ""希腊沃洛斯的"" (in Volos, Greece) to describe the location, while the reference translation uses ""在希腊沃洛斯举行的"" (held in Volos, Greece). This is a slight difference in phrasing, but both translations convey the same meaning.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, we need to compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify the differences.

Source: Fisher never responds verbally, but at one point unfastens a clasp over his mouth from which green ooze bubbles and drips to the floor.

Machine translation: 费舍尔从不口头回答 ， 但有一次他的嘴巴上松开了一个扣子 ， 绿色的水泡从上面滴到了地上。

Reference translation: 费舍尔（Fisher）从不口头回应，但在某一时刻他的嘴上解开了一个钩扣，绿色的气泡从钩扣滴落到地板上。

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, ""Fisher"" is not mentioned, while it is mentioned in the reference translation.
2. In the machine translation, ""从不口头回答"" is used to translate ""never responds verbally,"" while ""从不口头回应"" is used in the reference translation. The difference is the use of ""回答"" (answer) in the machine translation instead of ""回应"" (response) in the reference translation.
3. In the machine translation, ""绿色的水泡"" is used to translate ""green ooze bubbles,"" while ""绿色的气泡"" is used in the reference translation. The difference is the use of ""水泡"" (water bubbles) in the machine translation instead of ""气泡"" (bubbles) in the reference translation.
4. In the machine translation, ""从上面滴到了地上"" is used to translate ""drips to the floor,"" while ""从钩扣滴落到地板上"" is used in the reference translation. The difference is the use of ""从上面滴到了地上"" (from above dripped to the ground) in the machine translation instead of ""从钩扣滴落到地板上"" (from the clasp dripped to the floor) in the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in the choice of words and phrasing compared to the reference translation. The machine translation could be improved by including ""Fisher,"" using ""回应"" instead of ""回答,"" using ""气泡"" instead of ""水泡,"" and using ""从钩扣滴落到地板上"" instead of ""从上面滴到了地上.""

Reference translation: 2006年底，《年轻和骚动不安的一族》重演了日间人气女反派希拉·卡特的角色。

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""无休止者"" (Endless) instead of ""骚动不安的一族"" (Restless Family) to translate ""The Young and the Restless."" This is a minor difference, but the reference translation is more accurate.
2. The machine translation uses ""白天恶毒的角色"" (daytime evil role) instead of ""日间人气女反派"" (daytime popular villainess) to translate ""popular daytime villainess."" This is a significant difference, as the reference translation captures the specific term ""villainess"" (反派), while the machine translation only mentions ""evil"" (恶毒).
3. The machine translation uses ""希拉卡特"" (Sheila Carter) instead of ""希拉·卡特"" (Sheila Carter) for the name of the character. This is a minor difference, but the reference translation includes the middle name, which is more accurate.

Source: From 1887, anarchists began to outnumber socialists in the Socialist League.

Machine translation: 从 1887 年开始 ， 无政府主义者开始超过社会主义者。

Reference translation: 从1887年开始，无政府主义者在社会主义同盟中的人数开始超过社会主义者。

Now let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""社会主义联盟"" (Socialist League) directly from the source, while the reference translation uses ""社会主义同盟"" (Socialist Alliance). The difference in the translation of ""League"" and ""Alliance"" may cause confusion for Chinese readers. The reference translation is more accurate in this case.

2. The machine translation omits the word ""在"" (in) from the phrase ""无政府主义者在社会主义同盟中的人数"" (the number of anarchists in the Socialist Alliance). This omission changes the meaning of the sentence, as it now implies that anarchists simply outnumber socialists, rather than specifying that this occurs within the context of the Socialist Alliance. The reference translation is more accurate in this regard.

Based on the analysis, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation is more precise in conveying the meaning of the source text and is more suitable for Chinese readers.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 这座低矮的大厦从周围的房间内启航.
- Reference translation: 低矮的大厦从周围的物业单位更为突显。

Differences:
1. Machine translation uses ""房间内"" (inside rooms) while the reference translation uses ""物业单位"" (property units).
2. Machine translation uses ""启航"" (set sail) while the reference translation uses ""更为突显"" (more prominent).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""房间内"" (inside rooms) in the machine translation is not accurate, as the source text refers to the surrounding tenement, not the rooms inside the building. The reference translation correctly uses ""物业单位"" (property units) to convey the meaning of the source text.
2. The use of ""启航"" (set sail) in the machine translation is not appropriate, as it implies a journey or adventure, which is not the intended meaning of the source text. The reference translation correctly uses ""更为突显"" (more prominent) to convey the intended meaning of the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not accurate and does not convey the intended meaning of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and better captures the meaning of the source text. The quality of the machine translation is poor.

- In the machine translation, the phrase ""与白痴混在一起的水中"" (water mixed with stupidity) is used, while in the reference translation, the phrase ""掺有马鞭草的水"" (water mixed with vervain) is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the character's name is likely due to a typo or a different romanization of the same Chinese characters. This does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
- The difference in the pronoun ""他"" is a minor error and does not impact the overall quality of the translation.
- The use of ""淋浴"" (to shower) instead of ""给他洗澡"" (to give him a bath) changes the meaning slightly. In the source, it is clear that Elena is showering the person with water mixed with vervain, not just giving him a bath. This difference impacts the overall quality of the translation.
- The use of ""与白痴混在一起的水中"" (water mixed with stupidity) instead of ""掺有马鞭草的水"" (water mixed with vervain) changes the meaning significantly. In the source, vervain is a specific herb mentioned, and its inclusion in the water is important to the story. This difference greatly impacts the overall quality of the translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Guerrero feuded with Edge, to whom he lost at SummerSlam.
Machine translation: 格雷罗和艾格发生了争执, 他在夏季的比赛中输给了他.
Reference translation: 格雷罗和艾格发生了争执，他在SummerSlam输给了他。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. The machine translation uses ""夏季的比赛"" (summer's match) while the reference translation uses ""SummerSlam"" (a specific event).
2. The machine translation uses a comma (,) to separate the two clauses, while the reference translation uses a comma followed by a space (，).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""夏季的比赛"" (summer's match) is a less accurate translation of ""SummerSlam"" (a specific event). The machine translation does not capture the specific event's name, which may lead to confusion for readers who are familiar with SummerSlam.
2. The use of a comma followed by a space (，) in the reference translation is a more common punctuation style in Chinese, while the machine translation uses only a comma. This difference in punctuation may affect the readability of the machine translation.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation misses the specific event name ""SummerSlam"" and uses a less common punctuation style. These differences may affect the quality and readability of the machine translation.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and reference translation.
- Machine translation: 小猪被用树枝、草和叶子筑巢.
- Reference translation: 将小猪放在由树枝、草和树叶筑成的巢中。

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""被用"" (used) while the reference translation uses ""将...放在"" (put...in).
2. The machine translation uses ""树叶"" (tree leaves) while the reference translation uses ""树枝、草和树叶"" (twigs, grasses, and tree leaves).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""被用"" in the machine translation implies that the piglets are ""used"" for the nest, which is not the intended meaning. The reference translation more accurately conveys the idea that the piglets are ""put in"" the nest.
2. The machine translation omits the ""twigs"" and ""grasses"" from the list of materials used to construct the nest, only mentioning ""tree leaves."" This omission results in a less accurate translation.

2. In the machine translation, ""沿着 Rhaetian Limes"" is used instead of ""RhaetianLimes沿岸"" in the reference translation.

Analysis:

1. The use of ""新郎"" instead of ""马夫"" changes the meaning slightly, as ""新郎"" refers to newlyweds, while ""马夫"" specifically refers to grooms who take care of horses. This difference may not significantly impact the overall understanding of the sentence, but it is a minor discrepancy.

- 执政官 (consul suffectus)

Reference translation:
- LactucinusMaximus
- 公元前 437 年 (437 BC)
- 领事 (consul suffectus)

Step 4: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation.

- The name ""Lactucinus Maximus"" is translated differently in the machine translation (利斯特西努斯 · 马西穆斯) compared to the reference translation (LactucinusMaximus).
- The term ""consul suffectus"" is translated correctly in both the machine translation (执政官) and the reference translation (领事).
- The year ""437 BC"" is translated correctly in both the machine translation (公元前 437 年) and the reference translation (公元前 437 年).

Step 5: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is mostly accurate, with only a slight difference in the translation of the name ""Lactucinus Maximus."" The machine translation correctly translates the term ""consul suffectus"" and the year ""437 BC.""

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, I will first read the source, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation to determine the quality of the machine translation.

Source: Nicks also performed with Bob Dylan and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers during their tour in Australia.
Machine translation: 尼克斯还与鲍勃·迪兰和汤姆·佩蒂以及他们在澳大利亚之行的创意者一起演出。
Reference translation: 尼克斯在澳大利亚巡回演出中还与鲍勃·迪伦（BobDylan）和汤姆·佩蒂（TomPetty）以及“伤心者”（Heartbreakers）一起演出。

Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation does not include the name of the band ""Heartbreakers"" in parentheses after Tom Petty's name, while the reference translation does.
2. The machine translation uses ""他们在澳大利亚之行的创意者"" (their creators on their tour in Australia) to describe the band members, while the reference translation uses ""澳大利亚巡回演出中"" (during their tour in Australia) to describe the context of the performance.

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation provides more context and includes the name of the band, which is important for understanding the source text. The machine translation omits this information, which may lead to confusion for the reader. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation.

Machine translation: 她向哈努曼祝福说了许多好话和好话.
Reference translation: 她说了许多好话祝福哈努曼。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation has an extra ""和"" (and) between ""好话"" (kind words) and ""好话"" (good words).
- The order of the phrases is different in the machine translation compared to the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The extra ""和"" (and) in the machine translation is not needed, as it creates redundancy.
- The order of the phrases in the machine translation is not as clear as in the reference translation. The reference translation places ""说了许多好话"" (said many good words) before ""祝福哈努曼"" (blessing Hanuman), which makes it clear that the kind words are part of the blessing.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The extra ""和"" (and) and the different order of the phrases make the machine translation less clear and less natural. The reference translation is a better representation of the original source.

Source: She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes.
Machine translation: 她接上了响亮的公共电话, 就消失了.
Reference translation: 她接听正在振铃的公用电话，然后消失了。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""接上了"" (answered) while the reference translation uses ""接听"" (answered/picked up).
- The machine translation uses ""响亮的"" (loud) while the reference translation uses ""振铃的"" (ringing).
- The machine translation uses ""就消失了"" (disappeared right away) while the reference translation uses ""然后消失了"" (disappeared afterward).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of ""接上了"" instead of ""接听"" changes the meaning slightly, as ""接上了"" implies a more definitive action of answering the call, while ""接听"" implies a more passive action of picking up the call.
- The use of ""响亮的"" instead of ""振铃的"" changes the description of the telephone from ""ringing"" to ""loud,"" which is not an accurate description of a ringing telephone.
- The use of ""就消失了"" instead of ""然后消失了"" changes the pacing of the sentence, making it sound like she disappeared immediately after answering the phone, while the reference translation implies that she disappeared some time after answering the phone.

Overall, the machine translation is not of high quality, as it contains inaccuracies in both meaning and description. The translation is understandable, but the differences from the reference translation affect the overall quality.

Source: Karl Barth reinterpreted the Reformed doctrine of predestination to apply only to Christ.
Machine translation: 卡尔 · 巴思重新解释了改过自新的宿命论, 认为它只适用于基督.
Reference translation: 巴特(KarlBarth)重新解释了改革宗的宿命论，使之只适用于基督。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. The machine translation uses ""改过自新"" (change oneself anew) to translate ""Reformed,"" while the reference translation uses ""改革宗"" (Reformed/Protestant).
2. The machine translation uses ""认为"" (think/believe) to translate ""reinterpreted,"" while the reference translation uses ""重新解释了"" (reinterpreted).
3. The machine translation uses ""基督"" (Christ) for ""Christ,"" which is the same as the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""改过自新"" instead of ""改革宗"" changes the meaning of the sentence. ""改革宗"" specifically refers to the Reformed/Protestant tradition, while ""改过自新"" is a more general term for self-improvement or self-renewal. This difference affects the accuracy of the translation.
2. The use of ""认为"" instead of ""重新解释了"" changes the meaning of the sentence as well. ""重新解释了"" means ""reinterpreted,"" while ""认为"" means ""think"" or ""believe."" This difference also affects the accuracy of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation due to the differences in the choice of words and the change in meaning. The machine translation does convey the general idea of the source, but it is not as precise as the reference translation.

Source: Electric shuttles operated by MTD ferry tourists and shoppers up and down lower State Street and to the wharf.

Machine translation: 电力班车由旅游者和购物者运营 ， 往返于下州立大街和码头。
Reference translation: 电力班车由旅游者和购物者运营，往返于下州立大街和码头。

Upon reading the source text, I understand that it is talking about electric shuttles operated by MTD that transport tourists and shoppers between lower State Street and the wharf.

Now, let's compare the machine translation and reference translation:

Machine translation: 电力班车由旅游者和购物者运营 ， 往返于下州立大街和码头。
Reference translation: 电力班车由旅游者和购物者运营，往返于下州立大街和码头。

Both the machine translation and reference translation convey the same meaning, which is that electric shuttles operated by MTD transport tourists and shoppers between lower State Street and the wharf. The only difference between the two translations is the use of a comma in the reference translation, which is not present in the machine translation. This difference is minor and does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the translation.

In conclusion, the machine translation is of high quality and effectively conveys the meaning of the source text, with only a minor difference in punctuation compared to the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: 3, March 1950 ""Zorro Curbs a Riot"", West Magazine Vol.
Machine translation: 3, March 1950 ""Zorro Curbs a Riot"", West Magazine Vol.
Reference translation: 1950年3月3日，“Zorro遏制暴动”，《西部杂志》卷

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation is identical to the source text.
- The reference translation has the date in Chinese format (1950年3月3日) while the source and machine translation have it in English format (March 3, 1950).
- The reference translation uses Chinese characters for ""Zorro"" (Zorro遏制暴动) while the source and machine translation use the English name ""Zorro"".
- The reference translation uses Chinese characters for ""West Magazine"" (《西部杂志》卷) while the source and machine translation use the English name ""West Magazine Vol.""

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is identical to the source text, which means it is accurate in terms of content.
- The differences in the date format and the use of Chinese characters for ""Zorro"" and ""West Magazine"" are not significant errors, but they do make the machine translation less culturally appropriate and less fluent than the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is accurate in terms of content, but it lacks cultural appropriateness and fluency compared to the reference translation. The quality of the English-Chinese translation can be considered satisfactory, but there is room for improvement in terms of cultural adaptation and language fluency.

Reference translation: 守军在圣马丁斯门上布置了一支大的铁炮，将围攻者赶出了罗杰斯山。

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, ""伟大的铁道"" (great iron road) is used instead of ""大的铁炮"" (big iron cannon) in the reference translation. The machine translation incorrectly translates ""culverin"" as ""road,"" which changes the meaning of the sentence.
2. In the machine translation, ""防守人员"" (defenders) is used instead of ""守军"" (garrison) in the reference translation. The machine translation uses a more general term, while the reference translation uses a more specific term that refers to a military force stationed at a particular location.
3. In the machine translation, ""将围困者赶出了罗杰斯山"" (pushed the besiegers out of Rogers Hill) is used instead of ""将围攻者赶出了罗杰斯山"" (pushed the besiegers out of Rogers Hill) in the reference translation. The machine translation uses ""围困者"" (besiegers) instead of ""围攻者"" (besiegers), which is a slight difference in the description of the attackers.

Overall, the machine translation has some inaccuracies and differences compared to the reference translation. The translation of ""culverin"" as ""iron road"" is a significant error that changes the meaning of the sentence. The use of ""defenders"" instead of ""garrison"" is a minor difference in the description of the people placing the cannon. The difference in the description of the attackers is also a minor difference.

- Reference translation: 角龙 (horned dragon), 高脚龙 (high-crested dragon), 鸟脚亚目恐龙 (bird-footed ornithopods), 蜥脚类恐龙 (saurischian dinosaurs)

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation has some inaccuracies in translating the specific terms related to dinosaurs. For example, ""ceratopsians"" is translated as ""宫颈癌"" (throat cancer), which is not related to dinosaurs.
- ""Gorgosaurus"" is translated as ""大龙"" (big dragon), which is a vague translation and does not accurately represent the specific dinosaur species.
- ""Ornithopods"" is translated as ""兰花"" (orchid), which is not related to dinosaurs.
- ""Sauropods"" is translated as ""沙龙类动物"" (sand dragon type animals), which is a vague translation and does not accurately represent the specific group of dinosaurs.

Reference translation: 一些无神论者、自然神论者和怀疑论者认为宗教信仰是迷信。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
The machine translation uses ""理论家"" (theorist) while the reference translation uses ""自然神论者"" (deist).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
The term ""理论家"" (theorist) is a more general term that could encompass various types of theorists, while ""自然神论者"" (deist) is a specific type of theorist who believes in a supreme being but not in divine intervention. The source specifically mentions atheists, deists, and skeptics, so the reference translation is more accurate in capturing the intended meaning.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not entirely incorrect, but it is less accurate than the reference translation due to the use of a more general term. The machine translation does convey the overall meaning of the source, but it lacks the specificity of the reference translation.

Step 5: Provide a conclusion.
The quality of the machine translation is acceptable but not ideal.

123	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Axioms and correspond to ""disjunction introduction.""
Machine translation: 公理和对应于 ""解禁引言"".
Reference translation: 公理和对应于""分离引言"".

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
In the machine translation, the term ""解禁引言"" (disjunction introduction) is used, while in the reference translation, the term ""分离引言"" (separation introduction) is used.

Step 3: Analyze the meaning of the different terms.
""Disjunction introduction"" refers to a logical rule that allows a disjunction (a statement that can be either true or false) to be introduced into a proof. ""Separation introduction"" is another logical rule that allows a statement to be separated into two parts, each with its own truth value.

Step 4: Determine the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.
The machine translation is incorrect because it uses the term ""解禁引言"" (disjunction introduction) instead of the correct term ""分离引言"" (separation introduction). This difference in translation affects the meaning of the sentence, as the two logical rules are not the same.

Step 5: Provide a conclusion based on the analysis.
The quality of the English-Chinese translation is poor, as the machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The correct translation should use the term ""分离引言"" (separation introduction) instead of ""解禁引言"" (disjunction introduction).
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: 中队随后于 5 月 14 日抵达牙买加皇家港。
Reference translation: 该中队随后航行至牙买加皇家港口，于5月14日抵达。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""中队"" (squadron) while the reference translation uses ""该中队"" (that squadron).
- The machine translation uses ""抵达"" (arrive) while the reference translation uses ""抵达"" (arrive) as well.
- The machine translation uses ""牙买加皇家港"" (Jamaica Harbor) while the reference translation uses ""牙买加皇家港口"" (Port Royal, Jamaica).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the way the squadron is referred to (""中队"" vs. ""该中队"") is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall meaning.
- The use of ""抵达"" in both translations is correct and does not affect the quality.
- The difference in the way Port Royal, Jamaica is referred to (""牙买加皇家港"" vs. ""牙买加皇家港口"") is a more significant issue. The machine translation incorrectly refers to Port Royal as ""Jamaica Harbor,"" which is not the correct name. The reference translation correctly refers to it as ""Port Royal, Jamaica.""

Reference translation: 乐队成员包括歌手罗伯特·普兰特（RobertPlant），吉他手吉米·佩奇（JimmyPage），贝斯手/键盘手约翰·保罗·琼斯（JohnPaulJones）和鼓手约翰·邦汉（JohnBonham）。

2. Analyze the differences:
- In the machine translation, ""小组"" is used instead of ""乐队"" in the reference translation. ""小组"" means a small group, while ""乐队"" specifically refers to a music band.
- In the machine translation, ""乐团/键盘手约翰·保罗·琼斯"" is used instead of ""贝斯手/键盘手约翰·保罗·琼斯"" in the reference translation. ""乐团"" means band, which is not accurate in this context, as John Paul Jones is a bassist, not a band.
- In the machine translation, ""鼓手约翰·邦汉姆"" is used instead of ""鼓手约翰·邦汉"" in the reference translation. The name ""邦汉姆"" is incorrect, as it should be ""邦汉"" according to the source and reference translation.

2. The machine translation uses ""就会"" (will) while the reference translation uses ""将"" (would).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
1. The use of ""废墟"" (ruins) in the machine translation is incorrect because it implies that the kingdom would be destroyed and turned into ruins. In the source and reference translation, the kingdom is given back as a fief, which means it would be under the control of the Holy Roman Empire but still exist.
2. The use of ""就会"" (will) in the machine translation is not incorrect, but it is less formal and less accurate than the use of ""将"" (would) in the reference translation. The use of ""将"" (would) better conveys the conditional nature of the action.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some issues with the choice of words and the level of formality. The use of ""废墟"" (ruins) instead of ""封建地"" (fief) and ""就会"" (will) instead of ""将"" (would) affects the overall quality of the translation.

2. ""报仇"" means ""revenge"" in Chinese, which is similar in meaning to ""vengeance"". However, ""复仇"" is a more accurate translation of ""vengeance"" in this context. ""复仇"" implies taking action to get even or exact revenge, while ""报仇"" can also mean to bear a grudge or harbor resentment.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not of high quality because it contains errors in translating proper nouns and uses a less accurate word for ""vengeance"". The reference translation is more accurate and better captures the meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Greek and Roman mythology portray storks as models of parental devotion.
Machine translation: 希腊和罗马神话把小鸟描绘成父母忠诚的典范.
Reference translation: 希腊和罗马神话把鹳鸟描绘成父母奉献的典范。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 小鸟 (small bird)
- Reference translation: 鹳鸟 (stork)

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation uses ""小鸟"" (small bird) instead of ""鹳鸟"" (stork) as mentioned in the source and reference translation. This is a significant difference as it changes the subject of the sentence from a specific bird (stork) to a general term (small bird).
- The machine translation also uses ""父母忠诚"" (parental loyalty) instead of ""父母奉献"" (parental devotion). While both phrases convey a sense of loyalty and dedication, ""父母奉献"" (parental devotion) more accurately captures the meaning of ""parental devotion"" in the source.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation has some differences from the reference translation, which affect the accuracy of the translation. The machine translation does not accurately convey the specific subject (stork) and the exact meaning of ""parental devotion"" as mentioned in the source. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is not as high as the reference translation.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, I will first read and understand the source, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation to determine the quality of the machine translation.

Source: Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs.

Machine translation: 拥有自己幼崽的狮子座比没有幼崽的狮子座更有可能容忍另一个狮子座的幼崽。

Reference translation: 有自己幼崽的母狮比没有幼崽的母狮更容易容忍其他母狮的幼崽。

Analysis:

1. The machine translation and reference translation both convey the same meaning, which is that lionesses with their own cubs are more likely to be tolerant of other lionesses' cubs than those without cubs.

2. The machine translation uses ""狮子座"" (lioness) while the reference translation uses ""母狮"" (mother lioness). Both terms refer to the same subject, so this difference does not affect the overall meaning.

3. The machine translation uses ""更有可能"" (more likely) while the reference translation uses ""更容易"" (easier). Both phrases convey the same idea of a higher probability or likelihood.

4. The machine translation uses ""另一个狮子座的幼崽"" (another lioness's cubs) while the reference translation uses ""其他母狮的幼崽"" (other lionesses' cubs). Both phrases refer to the cubs of other lionesses, so this difference does not affect the overall meaning.

Conclusion:

The machine translation is of high quality, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is very similar to the reference translation. The differences between the machine translation and reference translation are minor and do not affect the overall meaning.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.

Source: The Tribunes worked together with many other Romans to overthrow those who sought to corrupt the Republic.
Machine translation: 法庭与许多其他罗马人合作 ， 推翻那些企图腐蚀共和国的人。
Reference translation: 护民官与许多其他罗马人合作，推翻那些企图破坏共和国的人。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""法庭"" (court) is used, while in the reference translation, ""护民官"" (tribune) is used.
2. In the machine translation, ""腐蚀"" (corruption) is used, while in the reference translation, ""破坏"" (destroy) is used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""法庭"" (court) instead of ""护民官"" (tribune) is a significant error, as the tribunes were specific officials in the Roman Republic responsible for protecting the rights of the citizens, not the court. This error changes the meaning of the sentence.
2. The use of ""腐蚀"" (corruption) instead of ""破坏"" (destroy) is a minor error, as both words convey the idea of harming the Republic, but ""破坏"" is more accurate in this context.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of low quality because it contains a significant error in the translation of ""tribune"" as ""court"" and a minor error in the translation of ""corrupt"" as ""corruption.""

4. The machine translation uses ""交织在一起"" (intertwine) while the reference translation uses ""弥漫在"" (pervade).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""通常的"" vs. ""像往常一样的"" is a minor difference, as both phrases convey the idea of ""usual."" However, the reference translation's phrase is more idiomatic in English.
2. The use of ""欢庆"" vs. ""欢乐情绪"" is a more significant difference. ""欢庆"" is a more specific term for ""celebrations,"" while ""欢乐情绪"" is a more general term for ""joyful mood."" The reference translation's choice of words better captures the meaning of the source text.
3. The use of ""密切的呼声"" vs. ""亲密通话"" is another significant difference. ""密切的呼声"" literally means ""close calls"" but is not idiomatic in English. ""亲密通话"" is a more accurate translation of ""intimate conversations"" and is more idiomatic in English.
4. The use of ""交织在一起"" vs. ""弥漫在"" is a minor difference. Both phrases convey the idea of something being interspersed or spread throughout. However, the reference translation's phrase is more idiomatic in English.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some differences from the reference translation, and some of these differences result in less accurate or idiomatic translations. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is not as high as the reference translation.

2. The machine translation uses ""各种申请人"" (various applicants), while the reference translation uses ""各种人"" (various people).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""仲裁"" (arbitration) in the machine translation is accurate, as it conveys the idea of Edward I of England acting as a neutral party to resolve disputes between claimants for the Scottish crown.
2. The use of ""各种申请人"" (various applicants) in the machine translation is also accurate, as it refers to the different people who were claiming the Scottish crown.

However, the use of ""周旋"" (maneuvering) in the reference translation adds a more dynamic and active aspect to the situation, suggesting that Edward I of England was actively navigating the various claims and claimants for the Scottish crown. This nuance is lost in the machine translation, which uses ""仲裁"" (arbitration), a more passive and formal term.

Additionally, the use of ""各种人"" (various people) in the reference translation is more general and inclusive, while the machine translation uses ""各种申请人"" (various applicants), which specifically refers to those who were making claims for the Scottish crown. This difference in word choice may slightly affect the overall meaning of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the main idea of the source text. However, it lacks the dynamic and active aspect present in the reference translation, and there is a slight difference in the word choice that may affect the overall meaning.

2. 重新油漆墙壁 (repainting walls) vs. 重新粉刷墙壁 (re-painting walls): The machine translation uses 重新油漆 (repainting) while the reference translation uses 重新粉刷 (re-painting). The reference translation is more accurate as 粉刷 (paint) is a more general term that can include both repainting and painting for the first time.

3. 改善地板 (refinishing floors) vs. 修复地板 (repairing floors): The machine translation uses 改善 (improve) while the reference translation uses 修复 (repair). The reference translation is more accurate as the source text mentions repairing floors, not just improving them.

4. 修复壁炉 (repairing fireplaces) vs. 修复壁炉 (repairing fireplaces): Both translations are the same and accurate.

5. 更换古董管道、窗户和电线 (replacing antique pipes, windows, and wires) vs. 更换古董管道，窗户和电线 (replacing antique pipes, windows, and wires): The machine translation adds a comma after 管道 (pipes), which is not present in the source text. However, the meaning is still clear.

Machine translation: 当洛克低头钻进井里时, 又有一道闪光吞没了岛上.
Reference translation: 当洛克低头钻进井里时，又有一道闪光吞没了小岛。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""岛上"" (island surface) while the reference translation uses ""小岛"" (small island).
- The machine translation uses ""又有一道闪光吞没了岛上"" (another flash engulfs the island surface) while the reference translation uses ""又有一道闪光吞没了小岛"" (another flash engulfs the small island).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the description of the island (小岛 vs. 岛上) may change the meaning slightly. ""小岛"" (small island) implies a smaller, possibly more specific location, while ""岛上"" (island surface) could refer to any part of the island.
- The difference in the description of the flash (another flash engulfs the island surface vs. another flash engulfs the small island) may also change the meaning slightly. The reference translation implies that the flash engulfs the entire small island, while the machine translation implies that the flash engulfs a part of the island's surface.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in the description of the island and the flash. These differences may change the meaning slightly and make the translation less precise than the reference translation. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Source: Made her final appearance in episode 7, at the bistro.
Machine translation: 她在第 7 集最后一次露面 ， 在专场。
Reference translation: 她最后一次出现在第七集的小酒馆里。

Step 2: Identify the key elements in the source.
- final appearance
- episode 7
- bistro

Step 3: Compare the key elements in the machine translation and reference translation.

Machine translation:
- final appearance: 最后一次露面
- episode 7: 第 7 集
- bistro: 专场

Reference translation:
- final appearance: 最后一次出现
- episode 7: 第七集
- bistro: 小酒馆

Step 4: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation.

1. ""final appearance"" vs. ""最后一次出现"" vs. ""最后一次露面""
The reference translation and source use ""最后一次出现"" (last time appeared), which is more accurate than the machine translation's ""最后一次露面"" (last time surfaced).

2. ""episode 7"" vs. ""第七集"" vs. ""第 7 集""
The reference translation and machine translation both accurately translate ""episode 7"" as ""第七集"" (seventh episode).

3. ""bistro"" vs. ""专场"" vs. ""小酒馆""
The reference translation and source use ""小酒馆"" (bistro), which is more accurate than the machine translation's ""专场"" (stage).

Step 5: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It has some errors in the translation of ""final appearance"" and ""bistro."" The overall quality of the machine translation is poor.

1. The machine translation uses ""6 个 RAR 公司"" (6 RAR companies) while the reference translation uses ""6个RAR"" (6 RAR). The reference translation is more accurate as it refers to a single company within the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR), rather than multiple companies.

2. The machine translation uses ""Nui Dat 2 巡逻"" (patrolled to Nui Dat 2) while the reference translation uses ""巡逻到NuiDat2"" (patrolled to Nui Dat 2). Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation is more concise.

3. The machine translation uses ""通过隆坦橡胶种植园返回"" (returned through the Long Tân rubber plantation) while the reference translation uses ""通过LongTân橡胶园返回"" (returned through Long Tân rubber plantation). Both translations convey the same meaning, but the reference translation is more accurate as it uses the correct Chinese name for the rubber plantation (Long Tân) instead of the machine translation's approximation (隆坦).

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has some minor inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The reference translation is more concise and accurate in some aspects, such as referring to a single company within 6 RAR and using the correct Chinese name for the rubber plantation.

Machine translation: 巴尔布拉在鬼魂中看到约翰尼, 被骑马人带走, 吃掉了.
Reference translation: 芭芭拉看到强尼在食尸鬼当中，被尸群带走并吞噬了。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. In the machine translation, ""鬼魂"" (ghosts) is used instead of ""食尸鬼"" (ghouls) in the reference translation.

3. In the machine translation, ""吃掉了"" (devoured) is used instead of ""吞噬了"" (devoured) in the reference translation.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""鬼魂"" instead of ""食尸鬼"" changes the meaning slightly, as ""鬼魂"" refers to ghosts, while ""食尸鬼"" specifically refers to ghouls, which are more accurately described as flesh-eating creatures. This difference affects the quality of the translation.
2. The use of ""骑马人"" instead of ""尸群"" also changes the meaning, as ""骑马人"" refers to horsemen, which is not the same as a horde of ghouls. This difference also affects the quality of the translation.
3. The use of ""吃掉了"" instead of ""吞噬了"" is a minor difference, as both phrases convey the idea of being devoured. However, ""吞噬了"" is more specific and vivid in describing the act of being devoured. This difference has a minimal impact on the quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some differences from the reference translation, which affect the quality of the translation. The use of ""鬼魂"" and ""骑马人"" instead of ""食尸鬼"" and ""尸群"" change the meaning and context of the sentence, leading to a less accurate translation.

Machine translation: 6 月 23 日 ， 里奇 · 哈顿在击倒何塞 · 路易斯 · 卡斯蒂略的时候为自己的环球轻量级冠军杯进行了防守。

Reference translation: 6月23日，里奇·哈顿（RickyHatton）击败淘汰赛的何塞·路易斯·卡斯蒂略（JoséLuisCastillo），卫冕擂台轻中量级冠军。

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""击倒"" (knock down) while the reference translation uses ""击败"" (defeat). The source text implies a victory by knockout, so ""defeat"" is more accurate.
2. The machine translation uses ""环球轻量级冠军杯"" (World Lightweight Championship Cup) while the reference translation uses ""擂台轻中量级冠军"" (Ring light welterweight crown). The source text mentions ""Ring light welterweight crown,"" so the reference translation is more accurate.
3. The machine translation uses ""为自己的环球轻量级冠军杯进行了防守"" (defended his World Lightweight Championship Cup) while the reference translation uses ""卫冕擂台轻中量级冠军"" (warded off the Ring light welterweight crown). The source text implies a defense of the title, so the reference translation is more accurate.

Based on these differences, the reference translation is more accurate and better captures the meaning of the source text. The machine translation has some errors in the choice of words and the representation of the original meaning.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Reference translation: 当他对她拒绝他的反应强烈时，她就把他解雇了。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
The only difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of the comma in the machine translation. The reference translation uses a comma after ""强烈时"" (when he reacts aggressively), while the machine translation does not.

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the difference on the overall quality of the translation.
The use of the comma in the reference translation helps to clarify the sentence structure and make the meaning clearer. Without the comma, the sentence might be interpreted as ""当他对她拒绝他的反应强烈时, 她就把他解雇了"" (When he reacts aggressively to her rejecting him, she fires him), which is not the intended meaning.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the omission of the comma affects the clarity of the sentence. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by including the comma for better clarity.

2. In the machine translation, the phrase ""首映式"" (premiere) is used, while the reference translation uses ""首映"" (premiere) without the ""式"" (style). The reference translation is more accurate, as ""首映"" is the common term used for premieres in Chinese.
3. The machine translation uses ""特别活动上演出"" (perform at special events) while the reference translation uses ""特别活动中演出"" (perform in special events). The reference translation is more accurate, as it correctly uses ""中"" (in) to indicate the location of the performance.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation omits the English names in parentheses, uses an unnecessary ""式"" (style) in the phrase ""首映式"" (premiere), and incorrectly uses ""上演出"" (at perform) instead of ""中演出"" (in perform) to describe the performance location.

- Subject: the Czechoslovaks and Southern Slavs
- Action: declared their independence

Step 2: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.

- Action: 宣布独立 (declared independence) vs. 宣布独立 (declared independence)

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation uses ""战争"" (war) while the reference translation uses ""战役"" (battles). The difference is subtle, but ""战役"" is more specific to the context of the source sentence, as it refers to specific battles within a war, rather than the entire war.
- The machine translation uses ""和"" (and) to connect the two subjects, while the reference translation uses ""人"" (people) to specify the nationality of the subjects. This difference changes the meaning slightly, as the reference translation is more specific about the nationalities of the people involved.
- The action in both translations is the same, so there is no difference here.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in the specificity of the time and subjects. The reference translation is slightly more accurate in these aspects. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement in capturing the specific details of the source sentence.

Source: Arnold Ehret's pseudoscientific Mucusless Diet Healing System espoused fasting.
Machine translation: 阿诺德·埃雷特的伪科学无角饮食治疗系统支持禁食。
Reference translation: 阿诺德·埃雷特（ArnoldEhret）的伪科学非黏液饮食治疗学系统支持禁食。

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, the name ""Arnold Ehret"" is written as ""阿诺德·埃雷特"" without the parentheses and the last name is written with a different pinyin (Ehret instead of Ehret). The reference translation correctly includes the parentheses and the correct pinyin for the last name.
2. In the machine translation, the term ""Mucusless Diet"" is translated as ""无角饮食"" which means ""no horn diet"" instead of ""no mucus diet."" The reference translation correctly translates it as ""非黏液饮食"" which means ""no mucus diet.""
3. The machine translation correctly translates ""Healing System"" as ""治疗系统"" and ""espoused fasting"" as ""支持禁食.""

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some errors in translating the name and the term ""Mucusless Diet."" The reference translation is more accurate in these areas. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is good but not perfect.

229	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Water from the mole drains seeps into the pipes and runs along them into a ditch.
Machine translation: 从摩尔排出的水渗入管子, 沿着管子跑到沟里.
Reference translation: 痣排泄物中的水渗入管道中，并沿着管道进入沟渠。

Step 2: Identify the key differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 从摩尔排出的水渗入管子, 沿着管子跑到沟里.
- Reference translation: 痣排泄物中的水渗入管道中，并沿着管道进入沟渠。

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation uses ""摩尔排出的水"" (water from the mole), while the reference translation uses ""痣排泄物中的水"" (water from the mole drainage). The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the context of ""mole"" as a living creature, while the reference translation correctly identifies it as a term for a drainage system.
- The machine translation uses ""管子"" (pipes) while the reference translation uses ""管道"" (pipes/tunnels). The machine translation is less specific in describing the type of pipes, which could lead to confusion.
- The machine translation uses ""沿着管子跑到沟里"" (along the pipes into a ditch), while the reference translation uses ""沿着管道进入沟渠"" (along the pipes into a ditch/tunnel). The machine translation is less accurate in describing the destination of the water (a ditch) compared to the reference translation (a ditch/tunnel).

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several aspects. It misunderstands the context of ""mole,"" uses less specific terminology for the pipes, and provides a less accurate description of the destination of the water. These differences indicate that the machine translation is not of high quality.

- The machine translation's choice of ""吓坏了"" does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text, which is about being nettled or annoyed, rather than being scared. The reference translation's ""激怒了"" accurately captures the feeling of being nettled.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not of high quality because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text and lacks the expressiveness of the reference translation. The differences in word choice and the inaccurate representation of the source text's meaning result in a lower quality translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Reference translation: 乔用""CoquinaClutch""来对付Reigns时，史特朗曼（Strowman）对Reigns进行了连续的前踢。

Analysis:
1. Both the machine translation and reference translation correctly convey the main actions in the source: Joe applying the ""Coquina Clutch"" on Reigns and Strowman performing an action on Reigns.
2. The machine translation uses ""前卫式击球"" (front ward strike) to describe Strowman's action, while the reference translation uses ""连续的前踢"" (continuous front kick). The machine translation is less accurate in this aspect, as it does not clearly convey the ""running"" aspect of the front dropkick.
3. The machine translation correctly translates ""Reigns"" as ""君主"" and ""Joe"" as ""乔,"" while the reference translation uses the names in English.
4. The machine translation does not mention Strowman's name, while the reference translation includes it. This is a minor issue, but it could cause confusion for readers who are not familiar with the context.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has some issues with conveying the specific action performed by Strowman. The reference translation is more accurate in this aspect. The machine translation also omits Strowman's name, which is a minor issue.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Later Disney Company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit Walt Disney alone.
Machine translation: 后来迪士尼公司重新发行早期动画片倾向于将沃尔特 · 迪士尼的声誉完全归功于自己.
Reference translation: 后来迪士尼公司重新发行早期动画片往往都归功于沃尔特·迪士尼自己。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 后来迪士尼公司重新发行早期动画片倾向于将沃尔特 · 迪士尼的声誉完全归功于自己.
- Reference translation: 后来迪士尼公司重新发行早期动画片往往都归功于沃尔特·迪士尼自己。

Difference 1: 倾向于将沃尔特 · 迪士尼的声誉完全归功于自己 (Machine translation) vs. 往往都归功于沃尔特·迪士尼自己 (Reference translation)
- The machine translation uses 倾向于 (tend to) while the reference translation uses 往往都 (often all).

Difference 2: 完全归功于自己 (Machine translation) vs. 自己 (Reference translation)
- The machine translation uses 完全归功于自己 (completely credit to himself) while the reference translation uses 自己 (himself).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is slightly different from the reference translation in terms of the choice of words and the structure of the sentence.
- The machine translation uses 倾向于 (tend to) which implies that it is not always the case, while the reference translation uses 往往都 (often all) which implies that it is usually the case.
- The machine translation uses 完全归功于自己 (completely credit to himself) which is a more specific way of saying it, while the reference translation uses 自己 (himself) which is more general.

Overall, the machine translation is not a perfect match for the reference translation, but it still conveys the same general meaning. The quality of the machine translation can be considered as acceptable, but there is room for improvement in terms of word choice and sentence structure.

Machine translation: 鲍尔曼把袋子塞进宇宙飞船的鼻子里, 宇宙飞船然后右转.
Reference translation: 鲍尔曼给航天器机头的袋子充气，然后航天器就归位了。

Step 2: Identify the key elements in the source.
- Borman
- inflated the bags
- in the nose of the spacecraft
- righted itself

Step 3: Compare the key elements in the machine translation and reference translation.

Machine translation:
- 鲍尔曼 (Borman)
- 把袋子塞进宇宙飞船的鼻子里 (inflated the bags in the nose of the spacecraft)
- 宇宙飞船然后右转 (the spacecraft then righted itself)

Reference translation:
- 鲍尔曼 (Borman)
- 给航天器机头的袋子充气 (inflated the bags in the nose of the spacecraft)
- 航天器就归位了 (the spacecraft then righted itself)

Step 4: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""把袋子塞进宇宙飞船的鼻子里"" (stuffed the bags into the nose of the spacecraft), while the reference translation uses ""给航天器机头的袋子充气"" (inflated the bags in the nose of the spacecraft). The machine translation is less accurate as it uses ""stuffed"" instead of ""inflated.""

2. The machine translation uses ""宇宙飞船然后右转"" (the spacecraft then righted itself), while the reference translation uses ""航天器就归位了"" (the spacecraft then righted itself). The machine translation is less accurate as it uses ""right turn"" instead of ""righted itself.""

Step 5: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.

The machine translation is less accurate than the reference translation due to the use of ""stuffed"" instead of ""inflated"" and ""right turn"" instead of ""righted itself."" The overall quality of the machine translation is poor.

Reference translation: 1956年12月2日，格兰玛号在洛斯凯伊洛斯附近粉红湖海滩的一个红树林沼泽中搁浅。

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, the name of the ship ""Granma"" is translated as ""奶奶"" which means ""grandma"" in Chinese. This is a significant error as it changes the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation correctly translates the name of the ship as ""格兰玛号"".

2. In the machine translation, the phrase ""Playa Las Coloradas"" is translated as ""Playa Las Coloradas 的一个红树林沼泽"" which means ""a mangrove swamp of Playa Las Coloradas"". This is a slight error as the correct translation should be ""一个红树林沼泽中的 Playa Las Coloradas"" which means ""a mangrove swamp at Playa Las Coloradas"". The reference translation correctly follows this structure.

Reference translation: 在罗莎的带领下，史高治变得更有道德感；虽然他从不作弊，但他会无情地利用任何漏洞。

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""罗莎的统治下"" (Rosa's rule) is used, while the reference translation uses ""罗莎的带领下"" (Under Rosa's guidance). The difference in phrasing does not significantly impact the meaning, but the reference translation is more natural in Chinese.
2. In the machine translation, ""更合乎道德了"" (more ethical) is used, while the reference translation uses ""更有道德感"" (more moral sense). The meaning is similar, but ""更有道德感"" is more accurate and conveys the idea of developing a stronger moral sense.
3. In the machine translation, ""毫不留情地利用任何漏洞"" (ruthlessly exploits any loopholes) is used, while the reference translation uses ""无情地利用任何漏洞"" (cruelly exploits any loopholes). The difference in adverbs (""毫不留情地"" vs. ""无情地"") does not significantly impact the meaning, but ""无情地"" is more appropriate in this context.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text.

Source: The chroniclers of Viking raids in Brittany and Normandy recounted that St Olaf raided the northern coast of Brittany in the area of the town of Dol.

Machine translation: 维京袭击布列塔尼和诺曼底的编年史者说圣奥拉夫袭击了多尔镇地区的布列塔尼北部海岸。

Reference translation: 维京袭击布列塔尼和诺曼底的编年史者记述，圣奥拉夫袭击了多尔镇地区的布列塔尼北部海岸。

Now let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""说"" (said) while the reference translation uses ""记述"" (recorded). The reference translation is more accurate as it conveys the idea that the chroniclers recorded the events, not just mentioned them.

2. The machine translation omits the word ""chroniclers"" (编年史者) from the beginning of the sentence, which is an important part of the source text. This omission makes the machine translation less accurate than the reference translation.

Based on these differences, the machine translation is less accurate than the reference translation. The reference translation more accurately captures the meaning of the source text and follows the original sentence structure more closely.

Source: Wilson's costar Kate Mansi told Soap Opera Digest about filming the scenes.
Machine translation: 威尔逊的主演凯特曼西告诉肥皂剧摘要关于拍摄场景.
Reference translation: 威尔逊的合演凯特曼西《肥皂剧摘》讲述了拍摄场景。

Now, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, the term ""主演"" (main actor) is used, while the reference translation uses ""合演"" (co-star). The correct term should be ""合演"" as mentioned in the reference translation, as it accurately reflects the relationship between Wilson and Kate Mansi.

2. In the machine translation, the term ""肥皂剧摘要"" (Soap Opera Digest summary) is used, while the reference translation uses ""肥皂剧摘"" (Soap Opera Digest). The correct term should be ""肥皂剧摘"" as mentioned in the reference translation, as it is the correct name of the publication.

3. In the machine translation, the phrase ""关于拍摄场景"" (about filming the scenes) is used, while the reference translation uses ""讲述了拍摄场景"" (told about the filming scenes). The correct phrase should be ""讲述了拍摄场景"" as mentioned in the reference translation, as it accurately reflects the content of Kate Mansi's statement.

Based on the analysis, the machine translation has some inaccuracies in terms of the relationship between Wilson and Kate Mansi, the name of the publication, and the content of Kate Mansi's statement. The reference translation is more accurate in these aspects. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is not as good as the reference translation.

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, ""绕道骑兵"" (bypassed the cavalry) is used instead of ""击退了骑兵"" (routed the cavalry) in the reference translation. This change alters the meaning slightly, as ""bypassed"" implies avoiding the cavalry rather than defeating it.
2. In the machine translation, ""雷恩斯基尔德"" is used instead of ""雷恩斯基特"" in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it is important to maintain consistency in the transliteration of names.
3. In the machine translation, ""撒克逊的正面进攻"" (Saxon's frontal assault) is used instead of ""撒克逊人的正面进攻"" (Saxon people's frontal assault) in the reference translation. This change is minor and does not significantly alter the meaning.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: so that a chaplain might sing Mass for him daily in St Peter's.
Machine translation: 这样一个牧师就可以每天在圣彼得教堂为他唱弥撒。
Reference translation: 这样牧师就每天可以在圣彼得大教堂为他唱歌。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 这样一个牧师就可以每天在圣彼得教堂为他唱弥撒。
- Reference translation: 这样牧师就每天可以在圣彼得大教堂为他唱歌。

Differences:
1. Machine translation uses ""一个牧师"" (one chaplain) while the reference translation uses ""牧师"" (priest) without specifying the number.
2. Machine translation uses ""唱弥撒"" (sing Mass) while the reference translation uses ""唱歌"" (sing a song).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""一个牧师"" (one chaplain) in the machine translation is more specific than ""牧师"" (priest) in the reference translation. However, the context of the sentence suggests that a chaplain is not necessary, as a priest can also sing Mass. This difference does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence.
2. The use of ""唱弥撒"" (sing Mass) in the machine translation is more accurate than ""唱歌"" (sing a song) in the reference translation. The term ""唱弥撒"" specifically refers to singing the Mass, which is a religious ceremony, while ""唱歌"" (sing a song) is a more general term that could refer to any type of singing. This difference does impact the overall meaning of the sentence, as the machine translation is more accurate in this regard.

Conclusion: The machine translation is generally accurate, but it could be improved by using the more general term ""牧师"" (priest) instead of ""一个牧师"" (one chaplain) and by using the more specific term ""唱弥撒"" (sing Mass) instead of ""唱歌"" (sing a song).

1. In the machine translation, the name of the Shenandoah River is translated as ""参大河"" (Shenandoah River is ""参大河"" in Chinese), while in the reference translation, it is correctly translated as ""谢南多厄河"" (Shenandoah River is ""谢南多厄河"" in Chinese).
2. The machine translation uses the simplified Chinese character ""大"" for ""river"" (大河), while the reference translation uses the traditional Chinese character ""大"" (大河).

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has two minor errors compared to the reference translation. The first error is the incorrect translation of the Shenandoah River's name, and the second error is the use of a simplified Chinese character instead of the traditional character. These differences may not significantly impact the overall meaning, but they do affect the accuracy of the translation.

Source: These ultimately imply that this allegory of Marie de' Medici is an apotheosis.
Machine translation: 这最终意味着玛丽·德·梅迪奇（Mariede'Medi）的这一寓言是一种道歉。
Reference translation: 这些最终意味着玛丽·德·梅迪奇（Mariede'Medi）的这一寓言是一种道歉。

Upon reading the source, machine translation, and reference translation, I notice that the machine translation is slightly different from the reference translation. The main difference is the use of the word ""道歉"" (apology) in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses the word ""道歉"" (apotheosis).

The source states that the allegory of Marie de' Medici is an apotheosis, which means it is a glorification or exaltation. The machine translation, however, translates it as an apology, which is a different meaning.

Considering the differences between the machine translation and reference translation, I would say that the quality of the English-Chinese translation is not very good. The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text, and the use of the wrong word (""道歉"" instead of ""道歉"") contributes to the misunderstanding. The reference translation, on the other hand, accurately captures the meaning of the source text.

Source: Egypt lies primarily between latitudes 22° and 32°N, and longitudes 25° and 35°E.
Machine translation: 埃及主要位于北纬 22 度至 32 度和东经 25 度至 35 度之间。
Reference translation: 埃及主要位于北纬22度至32度和东经25度至35度之间。

Step 1: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Both translations convey the same meaning: Egypt is primarily located between latitudes 22°N and 32°N and longitudes 25°E and 35°E.

Step 2: Identify any differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The only difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the use of spaces around the degree symbols in the machine translation (e.g., ""北纬 22 度"" vs. ""北纬22度"").

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the translation based on the differences identified.
- The difference in the use of spaces around the degree symbols is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation. The machine translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is very close to the reference translation.

Conclusion: The quality of the English-Chinese translation is high. The machine translation is accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text well, with only a minor difference in the use of spaces around the degree symbols.

Now, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, the number ""1, 113"" is written, while in the source and reference translation, the number ""11.13"" is used. This is a minor difference, and the machine translation still conveys the correct meaning.

2. The machine translation uses ""决赛"" (finale) while the reference translation uses ""该决赛"" (that finale). Both translations are correct, but the reference translation adds a bit more specificity by using the demonstrative ""that.""

3. The machine translation uses ""击败了"" (defeated) while the reference translation uses ""击败了"" (defeated) as well. Both translations are correct and convey the same meaning.

4. The machine translation uses ""1, 113 万观众"" (1,113 million viewers) while the reference translation uses ""1113万观众"" (11.13 million viewers). The machine translation has a minor error in the number format, but the meaning is still clear.

Now, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""walked the leadoff hitter"" is translated as ""走了前锋"" (walked the leadoff), while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""保送了第一击球手"" (sent the leadoff hitter). The reference translation is more accurate as it captures the meaning of ""walking"" a batter in baseball, which means the batter reaches base without hitting the ball.

2. In the machine translation, ""allowed a hit to the next"" is translated as ""并允许下一个击球"" (and allowed the next hit), while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""并让他打出一个安打"" (and let him hit a single). The reference translation is more accurate as it specifies that the hit was a single, which is a more precise description of the event.

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation.

- The machine translation uses ""非固化特性"" (non-fixed characteristics) instead of ""离散性"" (discreteness) to describe the delocalized character of the bonding or valence bands. This difference changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""非固化特性"" implies that the character is not fixed, while ""离散性"" implies that the character is discrete.
- The machine translation uses ""粘结"" (adhesive) instead of ""键化"" (keyed) to describe the bonding or valence bands. This difference changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""粘结"" implies that the bands are sticky or adherent, while ""键化"" implies that the bands are keyed or have a lock-and-key structure.

Source: In 1976 he starred as cashier Howard Prince in The Front, directed by Martin Ritt.
Machine translation: 1976 年, 他主演霍华德 · 普林斯的出纳员, 由马丁 · 里特领导.
Reference translation: 1976年，他在马丁·里特执导的《正面交锋》中饰演收银员霍华德·普林斯。

Differences:
1. The machine translation does not include the title of the movie, ""The Front.""
2. The machine translation uses ""领导"" (lead) instead of ""执导"" (direct) for Martin Ritt's role.
3. The machine translation uses ""主演"" (star) instead of ""饰演"" (play) for the actor's role.

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in several aspects. The machine translation omits important information such as the title of the movie and the actor's role. Additionally, it uses different terms to describe the director's role and the actor's role. These differences may lead to confusion or misunderstanding for the reader.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is not as high as the reference translation. The reference translation provides a more accurate and complete representation of the source text.

Source: 1 flute sonatas, published in Nürnberg in 1756, to Friedrich.
Machine translation: 1 长笛奏鸣曲 ， 1756 年在纽伦堡向弗里德里希出版。
Reference translation: 1长笛奏鸣曲，1756年在纽伦堡出版，致弗里德里希。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation has an extra ""向"" (to) before ""弗里德里希"" (Friedrich), while the reference translation has ""致"" (to) before ""弗里德里希"" (Friedrich).
- The machine translation has ""年"" (year) before ""1756"" and ""在"" (in) before ""纽伦堡"" (Nürnberg), while the reference translation has ""年"" (year) after ""1756"" and ""在"" (in) before ""纽伦堡"" (Nürnberg).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation has an extra ""向"" (to) before ""弗里德里希"" (Friedrich), which is not needed in this context. The reference translation uses ""致"" (to), which is more appropriate.
- The machine translation has ""年"" (year) before ""1756"" and ""在"" (in) before ""纽伦堡"" (Nürnberg), which is different from the reference translation. However, the meaning is still clear, and the difference does not significantly affect the overall quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences in word choice and word order compared to the reference translation. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by following the reference translation more closely.

- early in the first quarter: the beginning of the first quarter of the game

Step 3: Compare the machine translation with the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 红皮队一季度早些时候就被击落了.
- Reference translation: 红皮队在第一节早段就完成了一次达阵。

Step 4: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation uses ""被击落了"" (was intercepted) instead of ""完成了一次达阵"" (scored a touchdown). This changes the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the Redskins' play was intercepted rather than resulting in a touchdown.
- Machine translation uses ""一季度早些时候"" (early in the season) instead of ""第一节早段"" (early in the first quarter). This changes the time frame, making it sound like the event happened early in the season rather than early in the first quarter of the game.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Reference translation: 康拉德（Conrad）开始缓慢撤退，回到君士坦丁堡（Constantinople），他的军队每天遭到突厥人的骚扰，突厥人袭击了散兵并击败了后卫。

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""慢慢撤退"" (slow retreat) while the reference translation uses ""缓慢撤退"" (gradual retreat). The difference is subtle, but ""缓慢"" (gradual) implies a more extended period of retreat, while ""慢慢"" (slow) refers to the speed of the retreat.
2. The machine translation uses ""君士坦丁堡"" (Junshi Tingdong) for Constantinople, which is a transliteration of the city's name, while the reference translation uses the Chinese name ""君士坦丁堡"" (Junshi Tingdong) for Constantinople. The machine translation is correct in this case.
3. The machine translation uses ""他的军队每天都受到土耳其人的骚扰"" (his army is harassed every day by the Turks) while the reference translation uses ""他的军队每天遭到突厥人的骚扰"" (his army is harassed every day by the Turks). The difference is minor, but ""遭到"" (suffered) adds a more passive tone to the sentence.
4. The machine translation uses ""流浪者"" (stragglers) while the reference translation uses ""散兵"" (stragglers). Both translations are correct, but ""散兵"" is more specific to the military context.

Reference translation: 他在硬币上的肖像也有一个圆环、一把剑和一根权杖，并带有他的献身精神，即HerclisDespotePatrisPatriae。

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, the word ""怀疑论者"" (skeptic) is used instead of ""权杖"" (scepter) in the reference translation.
2. In the machine translation, the name ""HerclisDespotePatrisPatriae"" is written with spaces between each word, while in the reference translation, it is written without spaces.

Analysis:

1. The use of ""怀疑论者"" (skeptic) instead of ""权杖"" (scepter) is a significant error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. The source text mentions a scepter, not a skeptic.
2. The formatting of the name in the machine translation is not consistent with the reference translation. However, this is a minor issue and does not affect the overall meaning.

Conclusion:

The machine translation has a significant error in the meaning of the sentence due to the incorrect translation of ""scepter"" as ""skeptic."" This error affects the overall quality of the translation. The formatting of the name is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the quality.

Reference translation: 他们通常有三个故事，通常有一个栏杆封顶，投射在皮带上，并在每个角落延伸成圆形的顶塔。

Now, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, the word ""理发师"" (hairdresser) is used instead of ""顶塔"" (tower) in the reference translation. This is a significant difference as it changes the meaning of the sentence.
2. The machine translation uses the word ""角落"" (corner) to describe where the circular bartizans are located, while the reference translation uses ""每个角落"" (each corner) to describe the same thing. This is a minor difference and does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is of low quality because it contains a significant error in the translation of the word ""top tower"" as ""hairdresser."" This error changes the meaning of the sentence and makes the translation inaccurate.

Machine translation: 当体育场空无一人的时候, 在比赛结束后也演奏了一个钟声.
Reference translation: 随着体育场的清空，手铃声在收场后响起。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and reference translation.
- Machine translation: 当体育场空无一人的时候, 在比赛结束后也演奏了一个钟声.
- Reference translation: 随着体育场的清空，手铃声在收场后响起。

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""当体育场空无一人的时候"" (when the stadium is empty), while the reference translation uses ""随着体育场的清空"" (as the stadium empties).
2. The machine translation uses ""在比赛结束后"" (after the game ends), while the reference translation uses ""在收场后"" (after the close).
3. The machine translation uses ""演奏了一个钟声"" (played a bell), while the reference translation uses ""手铃声"" (handbell chime).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The difference in the expression of ""when the stadium is empty"" vs. ""as the stadium empties"" does not significantly impact the meaning, but the reference translation is more natural in English.
2. The difference in the expression of ""after the game ends"" vs. ""after the close"" does not significantly impact the meaning, but the reference translation is more natural in English.
3. The difference in the expression of ""played a bell"" vs. ""handbell chime"" impacts the meaning, as a ""bell"" is a general term, while a ""handbell chime"" is a specific type of bell. This difference may cause confusion for the reader.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in the expression that may cause confusion for the reader. The reference translation is more natural in English and provides a clearer meaning. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement.

Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation to determine the quality of the machine translation.

Source: Despite crashing at around 135 mi/h, Martin only sustained a bruised wrist.
Machine translation: 尽管马丁在每小时 135 米左右坠毁 ， 但他的手腕只受了伤。
Reference translation: 尽管马丁在每小时135米左右的速度坠毁，但他只有手腕有一块瘀伤。

Now, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. The machine translation correctly translates the main idea of the source text, which is that Martin crashed at around 135 mi/h and only sustained a bruised wrist.
2. The machine translation uses ""每小时 135 米左右坠毁"" to convey the idea of crashing at around 135 mi/h. The reference translation uses ""每小时135米左右的速度坠毁"" to convey the same idea. Both translations are accurate, but the reference translation is more specific by mentioning ""speed"" (速度).
3. The machine translation uses ""但他的手腕只受了伤"" to convey the idea of Martin only sustaining a bruised wrist. The reference translation uses ""但他只有手腕有一块瘀伤"" to convey the same idea. Both translations are accurate, but the reference translation is more specific by mentioning ""bruise"" (瘀伤).

Overall, the machine translation is of high quality, as it accurately conveys the main idea of the source text and is only slightly less specific than the reference translation. The differences between the machine translation and reference translation are minor and do not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation to determine the quality of the machine translation.

Source: Brisco eventually kills Bly by stabbing him with a rod from the Orb causing Bly to disintegrate into a pile of ashes.
Machine translation: 布里斯科最终用刀杆刺杀了布利 ， 导致布利分解为一堆灰烬。
Reference translation: 布里斯科最终用刀杆刺杀了布利，导致布利分解为一堆灰烬。

Upon reading the source, machine translation, and reference translation, I notice that the machine translation is almost identical to the reference translation, with only one minor difference:

Machine translation: 布里斯科最终用刀杆刺杀了布利 ， 导致布利分解为一堆灰烬。
Reference translation: 布里斯科最终用刀杆刺杀了布利，导致布利分解为一堆灰烬。

The difference is the placement of the comma in the sentence. In the machine translation, there is a comma after ""布里斯科最终用刀杆刺杀了布利,"" while there is no comma in the reference translation.

Now, I will analyze the impact of this difference on the overall quality of the machine translation. The comma in the machine translation is not necessary and does not change the meaning of the sentence. The reference translation is more concise and clear.

In conclusion, the machine translation is of high quality, as it is almost identical to the reference translation and conveys the same meaning. The only minor difference is the unnecessary comma in the machine translation, which does not significantly impact the overall quality.

Source: It took two fielders to throw the ball back to wicket.
Machine translation: 花了两个场上的人才把球扔回篮板上.
Reference translation: 要两个守场员才把球投回三柱门区。

Step 2: Identify the key differences between the machine translation and reference translation.
- Machine translation: 花了两个场上的人才把球扔回篮板上.
- Reference translation: 要两个守场员才把球投回三柱门区。

Key differences:
1. Machine translation uses ""篮板上"" (backboard) while reference translation uses ""三柱门区"" (wicket area).
2. Machine translation uses ""花了"" (took) while reference translation uses ""要"" (to).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""篮板上"" (backboard) instead of ""三柱门区"" (wicket area) is a significant error, as it changes the meaning of the sentence. In the context of cricket, the backboard is not the correct term.
2. The use of ""花了"" (took) instead of ""要"" (to) is a minor error, but it does not significantly impact the meaning of the sentence.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of low quality due to the significant error in using ""篮板上"" (backboard) instead of ""三柱门区"" (wicket area). The minor error with ""花了"" (took) does not significantly impact the meaning, but it still contributes to the overall low quality of the translation.

Machine translation: 玛雅贵族修牙, 一些贵族在牙齿上戴了镶嵌的玉器.
Reference translation: 玛雅贵族实行了牙齿改良，一些君主的牙齿上镶嵌着玉石。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 玛雅贵族修牙, 一些贵族在牙齿上戴了镶嵌的玉器.
- Reference translation: 玛雅贵族实行了牙齿改良，一些君主的牙齿上镶嵌着玉石。

Differences:
1. Machine translation uses ""修牙"" (practised dental modification) while the reference translation uses ""实行了牙齿改良"" (implemented dental modification).
2. Machine translation uses ""一些贵族"" (some nobles) while the reference translation uses ""一些君主"" (some lords).
3. Machine translation uses ""在牙齿上戴了镶嵌的玉器"" (wore encrusted jade in their teeth) while the reference translation uses ""镶嵌着玉石"" (with gemstones embedded).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The difference in the first sentence is minor, as both translations convey the same meaning. However, the reference translation uses ""实行了"" (implemented), which is more accurate in describing the action of the Maya nobility.
2. The difference in the second sentence is also minor, as both translations convey the same meaning. However, the reference translation uses ""君主"" (lords), which is more specific and accurate in describing the social status of the individuals.
3. The difference in the third sentence is more significant. The machine translation uses ""镶嵌的玉器"" (encrusted jade), which implies that the jade is the main focus, while the reference translation uses ""镶嵌着玉石"" (with gemstones embedded), which implies that the gemstones are embedded in the teeth, not just the jade. This difference changes the meaning of the sentence and makes the machine translation less accurate.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in word choice and meaning that make it less accurate than the reference translation. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""牛"" (cow) instead of ""黄牛"" (cattle) in the beginning.
- The machine translation uses ""俗称的牛"" (cows) instead of ""俗称牛"" (cows) in the middle.
- The machine translation uses ""大型驯养丛林"" (domesticated forest) instead of ""大型驯养有蹄类动物"" (domesticated ungulates) in the end.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation has some inaccuracies in the vocabulary used. For example, ""大型驯养丛林"" (domesticated forest) is not an accurate translation of ""domesticated ungulates.""
- The machine translation has some minor grammatical errors, such as the placement of ""俗称的牛"" (cows) in the middle.

Step 4: Evaluate the overall quality of the machine translation.
The overall quality of the machine translation is not very good. There are inaccuracies in the vocabulary used, and the grammar is not entirely correct. The machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text as presented in the reference translation.

Source: Bruiser competes on both the PRCA and the elite series of the PBR.
Machine translation: 布鲁泽在 PRCA 和 PBR 的精英系列上都有竞争.
Reference translation: 布鲁泽参加了PRCA和PBR的精英赛。

Now, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses the phrase ""都有竞争"" (both compete), while the reference translation uses ""参加了"" (participated in) followed by ""PRCA和PBR的精英赛"" (the elite series of PRCA and PBR). The reference translation is more accurate as it conveys the idea that Bruiser is participating in both the PRCA and the elite series of the PBR. The machine translation's use of ""都有竞争"" (both compete) may imply that Bruiser is competing in both events, which is not the same as participating in them.

2. The machine translation uses the phrase ""精英系列上"" (in the elite series), while the reference translation uses ""PRCA和PBR的精英赛"" (the elite series of PRCA and PBR). The reference translation is more accurate as it specifies the elite series of both PRCA and PBR, while the machine translation only mentions the elite series in general.

Based on the analysis, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has some differences in meaning and does not convey the same message as the reference translation. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation.

Reference translation: Wettinger，G.，""回顾《彼得·卡萨罗的坎蒂琳娜》""，《马耳他研究杂志》，第十二页，第88至105页。

Upon comparison, we can see that the machine translation is almost identical to the reference translation. The only difference is the use of ""第十二页"" (page 12) in the machine translation, while the reference translation uses ""第十二页"" (the twelfth page). This is a minor difference, and the machine translation is still accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation.

Overall, the quality of the English-Chinese translation is high, with only a minor difference in the phrasing of the page number. The machine translation effectively captures the meaning of the source text and is very close to the reference translation.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 午间, 角落里通过了新奥尔良证券交易所.
- Reference translation: 当天中午，送葬行列经过了新奥尔良证券交易所。

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""午间"" (midday) while the reference translation uses ""当天中午"" (at noon).
2. The machine translation uses ""角落里通过了"" (passed by) while the reference translation uses ""经过了"" (passed).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""午间"" vs ""当天中午"" is a minor difference, as both phrases refer to the same time period. However, ""当天中午"" is more specific and accurate in this context.
2. The use of ""角落里通过了"" vs ""经过了"" is a more significant difference. ""角落里通过了"" implies that the cortege passed by the stock exchange in a corner, while ""经过了"" simply states that the cortege passed the stock exchange. This difference changes the meaning of the sentence and makes the machine translation less accurate.

Conclusion: The machine translation is less accurate than the reference translation due to the differences in time expression and the meaning of ""passed by"" vs ""passed.""

Source: At around 1 micrometer, these viruses, which infect amoebae, were discovered in 2003 and 2013.

Machine translation: 在 2003 年和 2013 年 ， 在大约 1 微米的时间里发现了这些感染阿莫巴伊的病毒。

Reference translation: 直径在1微米左右，这些感染变形虫的病毒在2003年和2013年均有发现。

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""大约"" (approximately) to translate ""around,"" while the reference translation uses ""左右"" (around) to convey the same meaning.
2. The machine translation places ""2003"" and ""2013"" before ""在大约1微米的时间里"" (in about 1 micrometer), which is not the correct order in Chinese. The reference translation places ""2003"" and ""2013"" after ""直径在1微米左右"" (diameter around 1 micrometer), which is the correct order.
3. The machine translation uses ""感染阿莫巴伊的病毒"" (viruses that infect amoebae) to translate ""viruses which infect amoebae,"" while the reference translation uses ""感染变形虫的病毒"" (viruses that infect shape-shifting creatures). The reference translation is more accurate because the source mentions ""amoebae"" specifically, not just any shape-shifting creatures.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has some errors in the order of words and the specificity of the translation. The reference translation is more accurate and better captures the meaning of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: 瓦茨的设计显示了一个门廊 ， 有两对罗马多丽奇的柱子和一个简单的冰冻和薄片。

Reference translation: 瓦茨的设计显示了一个门廊，带有两对罗马多立克柱子和朴素的饰条和圆角。

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, the term ""门廊"" (portico) is used, while the reference translation uses ""门廊"" (portico) as well.
2. In the machine translation, the term ""多丽奇"" (Doric) is used, while the reference translation uses ""多立克"" (Doric).
3. In the machine translation, the term ""冰冻"" (frieze) is used, while the reference translation uses ""饰条"" (frieze).
4. In the machine translation, the term ""薄片"" (fillet) is used, while the reference translation uses ""圆角"" (fillet).

Analysis:

The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor differences in the choice of words.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Visitors arrived by steamboat and later by railroad.
Machine translation: 来访者乘船到达, 后来乘火车到达.
Reference translation: 来访者乘船到达，随后乘火车到达。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""后来"" (later) while the reference translation uses ""随后"" (subsequently).
- The machine translation uses a comma to separate the two modes of transportation, while the reference translation uses a comma followed by a period.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The use of ""后来"" vs. ""随后"" does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. Both words can be used to indicate a later time or event. However, ""随后"" is more formal and is generally preferred in more formal writing or speaking situations.
- The use of a comma followed by a period in the reference translation is more grammatically correct in Chinese. In Chinese, a comma followed by a period can be used to separate two independent clauses that are related in meaning. This is not necessary in the machine translation because the two clauses are closely related and can be connected with a single comma.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate and conveys the meaning of the source text. However, there are some minor differences in word choice and punctuation that make the reference translation slightly more formal and grammatically correct. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement in terms of formality and grammar.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 第一幕和第二幕的开场白模仿了山上的卡莫拉大赛.
- Reference translation: 第一幕和第二幕的开场戏模仿了《山丘坎莫拉选美》。

Difference 2: 模仿了山上的卡莫拉大赛 (parody the Hill Cumorah Pageant) vs. 模仿了《山丘坎莫拉选美》 (parody the Hill Cumorah Beauty Pageant)

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- Difference 1: The machine translation uses ""开场白"" (opening scenes) instead of ""开场戏"" (opening scene). This is a minor difference, as both phrases refer to the beginning of an act, but ""开场戏"" is more specific to the actual scene being performed.
- Difference 2: The machine translation refers to the Hill Cumorah Pageant, while the reference translation refers to the Hill Cumorah Beauty Pageant. This is a significant difference, as the reference translation adds the word ""Beauty"" to specify that it is a beauty pageant, not just a general pageant.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has two key differences from the reference translation. The first difference is minor and does not significantly impact the overall meaning. The second difference, however, changes the context of the translation by not specifying that it is a beauty pageant. This difference could lead to confusion for readers who are unfamiliar with the Hill Cumorah Pageant.

Overall, the machine translation is of moderate quality. It captures the general meaning of the source text but lacks the specificity of the reference translation.

Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, the word ""队"" (team) is missing after ""小熊"" (Cubs). This omission changes the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the Cubs are selling Barrett to the Padres, which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly includes ""队"" to indicate that the Cubs team is involved in the trade.

2. In the machine translation, the word ""又"" (again) is used before ""从奥克兰收购了捕鱼手杰森. 肯德尔"" (later acquired catcher Jason Kendall from Oakland). This usage is incorrect, as ""又"" implies that the action of acquiring Jason Kendall is a repetition of a previous action. The reference translation correctly omits ""又"" to accurately convey the meaning of the source text.

Based on these differences, the quality of the machine translation is not very good. It has omitted important information and used incorrect word choices that change the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and better conveys the meaning of the source text.

2. The machine translation uses ""Frankston Y. C. W."" while the reference translation uses ""弗兰克斯顿（FrankstonY.C）"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The difference in the translation of ""The Frankston Bombers"" to ""The Frankston Bomber"" is likely due to the machine translation incorrectly assuming that ""Bombers"" is a singular noun, rather than a plural noun. In this case, the machine translation is incorrect.
2. The difference in the translation of ""Frankston Y.C.W."" to ""弗兰克斯顿（FrankstonY.C）"" is likely due to the machine translation not providing a direct translation for the abbreviation ""Y.C.W."". In this case, the machine translation is incomplete.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Source: In 2002, Diana ranked third on the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, above the Queen and other British monarchs.
Machine translation: 2002 年 ， 黛安娜在英国广播公司对 100 位最伟大英国人的民意测验中位列第三 ， 超过了女王和其他英国君主。
Reference translation: 2002年，黛安娜在英国广播公司的“100位最伟大英国人”的民意测验中位列第三，超过了女王和其他英国君主。

Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""英国广播公司"" (BBC) to refer to the poll, while the reference translation uses ""英国广播公司的“100位最伟大英国人”"" (BBC's ""100 Greatest Britons"") to specify the name of the poll.
2. The machine translation uses ""民意测验"" (public opinion survey) to describe the poll, while the reference translation uses the same term.
3. The machine translation uses ""超过了女王和其他英国君主"" (surpassed the Queen and other British monarchs) to describe Diana's ranking, while the reference translation uses the same phrase.

Analysis:

The machine translation is mostly accurate and captures the main ideas of the source text. However, it lacks the specificity of the reference translation in terms of the name of the poll and the use of quotation marks. This slight difference in specificity does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the translation, but it does make the reference translation slightly more accurate and informative.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is high, with only a minor difference in specificity compared to the reference translation.

Source: Consequently, the depression degenerated into a remnant low on November 16 and dissipated soon after that.
Machine translation: 结果, 萧条在 11 月 16 日恶化为残余低位, 在那之后不久就消散了.
Reference translation: 结果，萧条在11月16日恶化为残余低位，在那之后不久就消散了。

Upon comparison, I find that the machine translation is almost identical to the reference translation. There is only one minor difference:

1. Machine translation: 萧条在 11 月 16 日恶化为残余低位, 在那之后不久就消散了.
2. Reference translation: 结果，萧条在11月16日恶化为残余低位，在那之后不久就消散了。

The difference lies in the use of the character ""结果"" (consequently) in the reference translation, which is not present in the machine translation. However, the overall meaning and context of the translation remain the same.

Considering the high similarity between the machine translation and the reference translation, I would rate the quality of the English-Chinese translation as excellent. The machine translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is only slightly different from the reference translation.

Machine translation: 克拉莱内五重奏, 一般由单管和弦乐四重奏组成.
Reference translation: 单簧管五重奏，通常由单簧管和弦乐四重奏组成。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 克拉莱内五重奏
- Reference translation: 单簧管五重奏
- Machine translation: 一般由单管和弦乐四重奏组成
- Reference translation: 通常由单簧管和弦乐四重奏组成

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation uses ""克拉莱内五重奏"" (clarinet quintet) while the reference translation uses ""单簧管五重奏"" (clarinet quintet). The meaning is the same, but the reference translation is more specific in using the term ""单簧管"" (single-reed) to describe the clarinet.
- The machine translation uses ""一般由单管和弦乐四重奏组成"" (generally made up of a clarinet and a string quartet) while the reference translation uses ""通常由单簧管和弦乐四重奏组成"" (typically made up of a single-reed instrument and a string quartet). The reference translation is more accurate in describing the composition of the clarinet quintet.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the specificity of the reference translation in describing the clarinet as a ""single-reed"" instrument. Additionally, the machine translation uses ""一般"" (generally) while the reference translation uses ""通常"" (typically), which is a more accurate word choice in this context. Overall, the machine translation is of good quality but could be improved with more specificity and accurate word choice.

Reference translation: 南部和西部山脉被拆除和重建，让寺院的面积从约36英尺乘32英尺扩大到约56英尺乘52英尺。

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, the phrase ""南段和西段"" (south and west ranges) is translated as ""南部和西部山脉"" (south and west mountain ranges). This is a minor difference, but the original text refers to buildings or structures, not mountains.

2. In the machine translation, the phrase ""掩体"" (cloister) is translated as ""面积"" (area). This is a significant difference because ""掩体"" specifically refers to a covered walkway or courtyard, while ""面积"" is a more general term for area or space.

3. In the machine translation, the dimensions of the enlarged cloister are given as ""56 英尺增加到 52 英尺"" (56 ft increasing to 52 ft), which is incorrect. The correct translation should be ""56 英尺乘52 英尺"" (56 ft by 52 ft).

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""登甘起义"" (Dungan revolt) while the reference translation uses ""东干起义"" (Dungan revolt). Both translations are correct, but the reference translation is more consistent with the source text.
2. The machine translation uses ""穆斯林苏菲派"" (Muslim Sufi sects) while the reference translation uses ""穆斯林苏菲派、哈菲亚派和贾哈里亚派、格迪穆派等"" (Muslim Sufi sects, Khafiya, Jahariyya, and Gedimu). The reference translation is more specific and accurate in listing the different sects.
3. The machine translation uses ""内斗"" (infighting) while the reference translation uses ""内讧"" (infighting). Both translations are correct, but the reference translation is more consistent with the source text.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in the specificity and accuracy of the translations.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""一个槽"" (a trough) while the reference translation uses ""一个低压"" (a low pressure).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The term ""槽"" (trough) is not the most accurate translation for ""trough"" in the context of meteorology. In meteorology, a trough is a region of low pressure, so the term ""低压"" (low pressure) is more appropriate.
- The machine translation seems to have misunderstood the context and translated ""trough"" literally as ""槽"" instead of using the more accurate term ""低压"" as in the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is not entirely incorrect, but it is less accurate than the reference translation due to the incorrect use of ""槽"" instead of ""低压.""

2. Reference translation: Ziggler在与Payback对垒的比赛中败北。

Differences:
- The machine translation uses ""报答"" (reply) instead of ""Payback"" (the name of the event).
- The machine translation uses ""输给了"" (lost to) instead of ""败北"" (lost).
- The machine translation uses ""与 Sheamus 的比赛"" (match against Sheamus) instead of ""与Payback对垒的比赛"" (match at Payback).

Now, I will analyze the quality of the machine translation based on these differences.

1. Using ""报答"" instead of ""Payback"" is a mistake, as ""Payback"" is a proper noun and should not be translated.
2. Using ""输给了"" instead of ""败北"" is a minor mistake, as both phrases convey the idea of losing, but ""败北"" is more appropriate in this context.
3. Using ""与 Sheamus 的比赛"" instead of ""与Payback对垒的比赛"" is a significant mistake, as it changes the context of the sentence from a match at an event to a match against a specific person.

Overall, the machine translation has some minor mistakes and a significant mistake that changes the context of the sentence. The quality of the machine translation is not high.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, the phrase ""落下来的树"" (falling tree) is used, while the reference translation uses ""倒下的树"" (fallen tree). The difference in phrasing slightly changes the meaning, as ""落下来的树"" implies the tree is falling, while ""倒下的树"" implies the tree has already fallen.

2. In the machine translation, the phrase ""跳动"" (jumping) is used to describe the tree's movement, while the reference translation uses ""反弹"" (bouncing). These two phrases have slightly different meanings, as ""跳动"" implies a more general movement, while ""反弹"" specifically implies a bounce.

3. In the machine translation, the phrase ""乔治 · 奥努茨科的右衣骨"" (George Onuczko's right collarbone) is used, while the reference translation uses ""乔治·奥努茨科的右锁骨"" (George Onuczko's right clavicle). The difference in the bone name changes the specificity of the injury described.

Overall, the machine translation has some differences in meaning and specificity compared to the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: The colour of the pitcher varies from yellow to scarlet.
Machine translation: 投手的颜色从黄色到红不等.
Reference translation: 食虫植物的颜色从黄色到红不等。

Step 2: Identify the key differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 投手的颜色从黄色到红不等.
- Reference translation: 食虫植物的颜色从黄色到红不等。

The key difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the subject of the sentence. In the machine translation, the subject is ""投手的颜色"" (pitcher's color), while in the reference translation, the subject is ""食虫植物的颜色"" (the color of the insect-eating plant).

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation based on the differences identified.
The machine translation is incorrect because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The source text is talking about the color of a pitcher (a type of insect-eating plant), not the color of a pitcher (a baseball player). The reference translation correctly identifies the subject as an insect-eating plant, which is the correct interpretation of the source text.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The quality of the machine translation is poor because it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the subject of the sentence, which leads to a misunderstanding of the source text's meaning.

Source: From 1983, Attenborough worked on two environmentally themed musicals with the WWF and writers Peter Rose and Anne Conlon.
Machine translation: 1983 年以来 ， 阿顿博勒与世界自然基金会和作家彼得 · 罗斯和安妮 · 康隆一起创作了两部以环境为主题的音乐剧。
Reference translation: 从1983年开始，阿滕伯勒（Attenborough）与世界自然基金会（WWF）以及作家彼得·罗斯（PeterRose）和安妮·康隆（AnneConlon）共同创作了两部以环境为主题的音乐剧。

Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation does not include the name ""Attenborough"" (阿滕伯勒) in parentheses, while the reference translation does. This is a minor difference, but it does make the reference translation more informative.
2. The machine translation uses ""作家彼得 · 罗斯和安妮 · 康隆"" (writers Peter Rose and Anne Conlon), while the reference translation uses ""作家彼得·罗斯（PeterRose）和安妮·康隆（AnneConlon）"" (writers Peter Rose and Anne Conlon). The reference translation uses parentheses to indicate the full names of the writers, making it more clear and informative.
3. The machine translation uses ""1983 年以来"" (since 1983) and ""两部以环境为主题的音乐剧"" (two environmentally themed musicals), while the reference translation uses ""从1983年开始"" (from 1983) and ""两部以环境为主题的音乐剧"" (two environmentally themed musicals). The difference in phrasing does not significantly impact the meaning, but the reference translation is more natural in Chinese.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. However, the reference translation is slightly more informative and natural in Chinese. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is high, but there is still room for improvement.

Reference translation: 德斯特罗把所有的眼镜蛇党都聚集在一起，攻击眼镜蛇岛，并帮助击败线圈。

Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""眼镜蛇"" (Cobra) to refer to the organization, while the reference translation uses ""眼镜蛇党"" (Cobra Party). The reference translation is more accurate as it specifies that it is an organization (党) rather than just the name of the organization.
2. The machine translation uses ""线圈"" (Coil) for the word ""Coil"" in the source text. The reference translation also uses ""线圈,"" which is the correct translation for ""Coil.""

Based on the analysis, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by using ""眼镜蛇党"" instead of ""眼镜蛇"" to better convey the meaning of the source text.

1. In the machine translation, the title of the film is translated as ""伟大的斗士"" (The Great Dictator), while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""大独裁者"" (The Great Dictator). The difference in translation is due to the choice of characters that convey the meaning of ""great"" and ""dictator"" in Chinese. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the intended meaning of the film title.

2. In the machine translation, the name ""Benzino Napaloni"" is written as ""本齐诺 · 纳帕洛尼"" (Benzino Napaloni), while in the reference translation, it is written as ""本西诺·纳帕洛尼"" (Benzino Napaloni). The difference in the translation is due to the choice of characters for the name ""Benzino"" and ""Napaloni."" The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the intended name.

3. In the machine translation, the portrayal of Mussolini by Jack Oakie is written as ""描绘的"" (described), while in the reference translation, it is written as ""饰演的"" (portrayed). The difference in translation is due to the choice of verbs to describe the actor's performance. The reference translation is more accurate in capturing the intended meaning of the source text.

Reference translation: 哲学家、社会和政治理论家、教宗家庭的神学家。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""社会政治理论家"" (social and political theorist) while the reference translation uses ""社会和政治理论家"" (social and political theorist).
- The machine translation uses ""宗座家庭的神学家"" (Theologian of the Pontifical Household) while the reference translation uses ""教宗家庭的神学家"" (Theologian of the Pontifical Household).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the first part of the sentence (""社会政治理论家"" vs. ""社会和政治理论家"") is a minor one. Both phrases convey the same meaning, but the reference translation uses a more common and natural way of expressing the idea.
- The difference in the second part of the sentence (""宗座家庭的神学家"" vs. ""教宗家庭的神学家"") is more significant. The machine translation uses ""宗座家庭"" (household of the patriarch), while the reference translation uses ""教宗家庭"" (household of the pope). The difference in these terms changes the meaning slightly, as ""宗座家庭"" refers to a broader category of religious leaders, while ""教宗家庭"" specifically refers to the pope's household.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some minor issues. The difference in the first part of the sentence is a minor one, and the machine translation still conveys the intended meaning. However, the difference in the second part of the sentence is more significant, as it changes the specificity of the religious leader being referred to.

Machine translation: 1837 年 12 月 12 日 ， 巴克 · 米德洛西安进入悉尼。
Reference translation: 1837年12月12日，“Midlothian”号游艇进入悉尼角。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""巴克 · 米德洛西安"" (Baek Midelwsi'an) for ""barque Midlothian"", while the reference translation uses ""Midlothian"" in English.
- The machine translation uses ""悉尼"" (Shenzhen) for ""Sydney"", while the reference translation uses ""悉尼角"" (Sydney Heads) to accurately represent the source.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""barque Midlothian"" as ""巴克 · 米德洛西安"", which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly uses the name ""Midlothian"" in English.
- The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Sydney Heads"" as ""悉尼"", which is not accurate. The reference translation correctly uses ""悉尼角"" to represent ""Sydney Heads"".

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is of low quality because it inaccurately translates ""barque Midlothian"" and ""Sydney Heads"". The reference translation is more accurate and should be used as a better representation of the source.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Her blindness serves to accentuate the motif of racial blindness throughout the story.
Machine translation: 她的失明加深了整个故事中的种族失明运动.
Reference translation: 她的失明是为了突出整个故事中的种族失明主题。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 她的失明加深了整个故事中的种族失明运动.
- Reference translation: 她的失明是为了突出整个故事中的种族失明主题。

Differences:
1. Machine translation uses ""加深"" (deepen) while the reference translation uses ""是为了"" (is for) to describe the purpose of her blindness.
2. Machine translation uses ""种族失明运动"" (racial blindness movement) while the reference translation uses ""种族失明主题"" (racial blindness theme) to describe the motif.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""加深"" (deepen) in the machine translation implies that her blindness makes the racial blindness theme more prominent in the story, which is a reasonable interpretation. However, the use of ""是为了"" (is for) in the reference translation explicitly states that her blindness is intended to emphasize the theme, which is a more precise interpretation.
2. The use of ""种族失明运动"" (racial blindness movement) in the machine translation is less accurate than the use of ""种族失明主题"" (racial blindness theme) in the reference translation. A ""movement"" implies a social or political campaign, while a ""theme"" refers to a recurring idea or subject within a story.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation captures the general idea of the source text but lacks the precision and nuance of the reference translation.

Reference translation: 硫醇氧化通过将硫醇氧化为有机二硫化物，对液化石油气、煤油或喷气燃料进行脱硫。

Analysis:

1. The machine translation and reference translation both convey the same meaning, which is the process of desulfurizing LPG, kerosene, or jet fuel using Merox and oxidizing mercaptans to organic disulfides.
2. The difference between the two translations lies in the choice of words and the structure of the sentence. The machine translation uses ""用氧化汞"" (using mercury oxide) while the reference translation uses ""硫醇氧化"" (Merox oxidation). However, both translations are accurate and convey the same meaning.
3. The machine translation uses ""脱硫"" (desulfurize) while the reference translation uses ""脱硫"" (desulfurize) as well. This is a minor difference and does not affect the overall meaning of the translation.
4. The machine translation uses ""液化石油气、煤油或喷气燃料"" (liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene, or jet fuel) while the reference translation uses the same phrase. This is a correct translation and does not affect the overall meaning of the translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: 630 operates at the National Tramway Museum in Crich.
Machine translation: 在克里希的国家有轨电车博物馆营业的 630 个。
Reference translation: 630在克里希的国家有轨电车博物馆运营。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and reference translation.
- Machine translation: 在克里希的国家有轨电车博物馆营业的 630 个。
- Reference translation: 630在克里希的国家有轨电车博物馆运营。

Difference 1: The machine translation uses the word ""营业"" (open for business) while the reference translation uses the word ""运营"" (operate).
Difference 2: The machine translation includes the number ""630"" as an adjective, while the reference translation places it before the verb.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The use of ""营业"" instead of ""运营"" changes the meaning slightly, as ""营业"" implies that the museum is open for business, while ""运营"" implies that the museum is operating.
- The placement of the number ""630"" in the machine translation makes it less clear that it is referring to the number of the tram, rather than an adjective describing it.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation, as it contains slight differences in meaning and clarity.

Reference translation: 菲尼克斯成了批评者的关注对象，也成了辩护者的眼中钉。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""本事"" (local expertise) while the reference translation uses ""关注对象"" (focus of attention).
2. The machine translation uses ""道歉者"" (apologists) while the reference translation uses ""辩护者"" (defenders).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""本事"" in the machine translation is not accurate, as it does not convey the same meaning as ""nota bene"" (a point worthy of note) in the source. The reference translation correctly uses ""关注对象"" to convey this meaning.
2. The use of ""道歉者"" in the machine translation is also not accurate, as it does not convey the same meaning as ""apologists"" (people who defend or justify something). The reference translation correctly uses ""辩护者"" to convey this meaning.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: The Atlantic City Race Course also hosts horse racing.
Machine translation: 大西洋城市赛道也主办赛马.
Reference translation: 大西洋城马场也主办了赛马。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 大西洋城市赛道也主办赛马.
- Reference translation: 大西洋城马场也主办了赛马。

Difference 1: 大西洋城市赛道 (Atlantic City Race Course) vs. 大西洋城马场 (Atlantic City Race Course)
Difference 2: 也主办 (also hosts) vs. 也主办了 (also hosted)

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- Difference 1: The machine translation uses 大西洋城市赛道 (Atlantic City Race Course) while the reference translation uses 大西洋城马场 (Atlantic City Race Course). The difference here is minimal, as both phrases refer to the same location. However, the reference translation is more accurate as it specifically refers to the race course as a ""racecourse"" (马场).
- Difference 2: The machine translation uses 也主办 (also hosts) while the reference translation uses 也主办了 (also hosted). The machine translation is less accurate here, as it implies that the Atlantic City Race Course currently hosts horse racing, while the reference translation indicates that it has hosted horse racing in the past.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has two minor inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The first inaccuracy is the use of 大西洋城市赛道 instead of 大西洋城马场, and the second inaccuracy is the use of 也主办 instead of 也主办了. Overall, the machine translation is of good quality, but it could be improved by addressing these minor inaccuracies.

Now, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. The machine translation correctly translates ""handcrafted gold jewellery"" as ""手工制作的黄金首饰"" and ""basketry from Garhwal"" as ""来自 Garhwal 的篮子"". However, it omits the proper noun ""Uttarakhand"" and the adjective ""加尔瓦尔（Garhwal）的编织"" for ""basketry from Garhwal"".

2. The machine translation correctly translates ""woollen shawls"" as ""羊毛剃须"" and ""scarves"" as ""围巾"". However, it omits the proper noun ""Uttarakhand"" and translates ""rugs"" as ""地毯"", which is a correct translation but lacks the specificity of the source text.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but lacks the proper nouns and specific details present in the reference translation. This results in a slightly lower quality translation compared to the reference translation.

Analysis:
1. Both the machine translation and reference translation convey the same meaning, which is that Rudge arrives with the Countess while Quin brings the casino's croupier Pierre Vaucher.
2. The only difference between the machine translation and reference translation is the use of the term ""赌场主持人"" (croupier) in the machine translation and ""赌场管理人"" (casino manager) in the reference translation.
3. The term ""croupier"" refers to a person who oversees a specific gambling table in a casino, while ""casino manager"" refers to a person who manages the overall operations of the casino.
4. The machine translation is slightly less accurate than the reference translation because it uses the term ""croupier"" instead of ""casino manager."" However, the overall meaning is still understandable.

Conclusion:
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by using the term ""casino manager"" instead of ""croupier"" to better match the reference translation.

Reference translation: 法国拳击手皮埃尔·勒格隆因击倒了格拉迪亚，这是其第15次确认击杀。

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""因其第 15 次确认的死亡而击落了格拉迪亚"" (due to its 15th confirmed death, shot down the Gladiator), while the reference translation uses ""因击倒了格拉迪亚，这是其第15次确认击杀"" (because he shot down the Gladiator, this was his 15th confirmed kill). The machine translation incorrectly implies that the 15th confirmed kill was the death of the Gladiator, while the reference translation correctly states that the Gladiator was shot down as a result of the 15th confirmed kill.

2. The machine translation uses ""因其第 15 次确认的死亡而击落了格拉迪亚"" (due to its 15th confirmed death, shot down the Gladiator), while the reference translation uses ""因击倒了格拉迪亚，这是其第15次确认击杀"" (because he shot down the Gladiator, this was his 15th confirmed kill). The machine translation incorrectly uses ""其"" (its) to refer to the 15th confirmed kill, while the reference translation correctly uses ""他"" (he) to refer to the fighter ace.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation, as it misinterprets the relationship between the 15th confirmed kill and the shooting down of the Gladiator, and incorrectly uses ""其"" instead of ""他"" to refer to the fighter ace.

Machine translation: 迈阿密高级后卫凯尔? 赖特 (Kyle Wright) 投下 275 码和 2 次冲撞 ， 完成了 26 次出入证中的 21 次。
Reference translation: 迈阿密高级四分卫，凯尔·赖特（KyleWright）投掷275码，两次触地得分，并完成26次传球中的21次。

Analysis:
1. The machine translation correctly translates ""Miami senior quarterback"" as ""迈阿密高级四分卫"" and ""Kyle Wright"" as ""凯尔·赖特（KyleWright）"".
2. The machine translation correctly translates ""threw for 275 yards"" as ""投下 275 码"".
3. The machine translation correctly translates ""two touchdowns"" as ""两次触地得分"".
4. The machine translation correctly translates ""and completed 21 of 26 passes"" as ""并完成了 26 次出入证中的 21 次"".

However, there are some differences between the machine translation and reference translation:
1. The machine translation uses ""高级后卫"" for ""senior quarterback"", while the reference translation uses ""高级四分卫"". The reference translation is more accurate, as ""四分卫"" specifically refers to the quarterback position in American football.
2. The machine translation uses ""冲撞"" for ""touchdowns"", which is not the correct term for scoring in American football. The reference translation uses ""触地得分"", which is the correct term.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some minor errors in the translation of specific terms. The quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using more accurate translations for certain terms.

Machine translation: 因此 ， 他抵达罗马太晚 ， 无法参加 4 月份的开会会议。
Reference translation: 因此，由于他太晚抵达罗马了，无法参加4月份的会议。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. The machine translation uses ""开会会议"" (opening meeting) while the reference translation uses ""会议"" (conference/meeting).
2. The machine translation uses ""4 月份的开会会议"" (4th month's opening meeting) while the reference translation uses ""4月份的会议"" (April's conference/meeting).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
1. The term ""opening meeting"" is not the most accurate translation for ""Conclave"" in this context. A Conclave is a closed-door gathering of cardinals to elect a new pope. The term ""opening meeting"" does not accurately convey this meaning.
2. The machine translation is more literal, using ""4 月份的开会会议"" (4th month's opening meeting), while the reference translation is more concise and accurate, using ""4月份的会议"" (April's conference/meeting).

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It uses a less accurate term for ""Conclave"" and a more literal translation for ""April Conclave."" The reference translation is more concise and accurately conveys the meaning of the source text.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Mizoram's first football league debuted in October 2012.
Machine translation: 米佐拉姆的第一个足球联赛于 2012 年 10 月首发。
Reference translation: 米佐拉姆于2012年10月首次亮相自己的第一个足球联赛。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and reference translation.
- Machine translation: 米佐拉姆的第一个足球联赛于 2012 年 10 月首发。
- Reference translation: 米佐拉姆于2012年10月首次亮相自己的第一个足球联赛。

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""首发"" (first broadcast), while the reference translation uses ""首次亮相"" (first appeared).
2. The machine translation places ""自己的"" (its own) after ""第一个足球联赛"" (first football league), while the reference translation places it before ""第一个足球联赛"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the verb used to describe the debut of the football league (""首发"" vs. ""首次亮相"") changes the meaning slightly. ""首发"" implies that the league was broadcast for the first time, while ""首次亮相"" implies that Mizoram's first football league made its first appearance. The reference translation is more accurate in this regard.
- The placement of ""自己的"" in the reference translation is more natural and clear, as it emphasizes that the football league belongs to Mizoram. The machine translation's placement of ""自己的"" makes the sentence structure less clear.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source and has a more natural sentence structure.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation step by step:

1. Machine translation: 在二战希腊战役期间, 他指挥了一支过时的双机 Gladiator 战士的中队.
Reference translation: 在第二次世界大战的希腊战役期间，他指挥过时的双翼飞机“角斗士”战斗机中队。

2. Difference 1: The machine translation uses ""二战"" (WWII) while the reference translation uses ""第二次世界大战"" (Second World War). Both phrases refer to the same historical event, but the reference translation is more specific and provides more context.

3. Difference 2: The machine translation uses ""过时的双机"" (overtime double machine) while the reference translation uses ""过时的双翼飞机"" (obsolete biplane). The machine translation is not accurate in this part, as ""双机"" (double machine) does not convey the meaning of ""biplane"" in the source text. The reference translation correctly translates ""biplane"" as ""双翼飞机"" (biplane).

4. Difference 3: The machine translation uses ""Gladiator 战士的中队"" (Gladiator fighters' squadron) while the reference translation uses ""角斗士"" (Gladiator) and ""战斗机中队"" (fighter squadron). The reference translation is more accurate, as it correctly translates ""Gladiator"" as ""角斗士"" and ""fighters"" as ""战斗机中队"" (fighter squadron).

5. Difference 4: The machine translation does not mention the ""角斗士"" (Gladiator) in the translation, which is an important part of the source text. The reference translation includes this information, making it more accurate.

Based on the analysis, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation provides more context, uses more specific terms, and includes important information that is missing from the machine translation. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation.

Reference translation: 然而，这些模式三的前奏却同时使用G和C作为朗诵音调，并且常常从G到C的装饰性跳跃开始来确定这种音调。

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""背音"" (background tones) while the reference translation uses ""朗诵音调"" (reciting tones). The reference translation is more accurate as it correctly translates ""reciting tones"" into Chinese.
2. The machine translation uses ""内向型"" (inward-type) while the reference translation uses ""前奏"" (introits). The reference translation is more accurate as it correctly translates ""Introits"" into Chinese.
3. The machine translation uses ""建立这种语调"" (establish this tonality) while the reference translation uses ""确定这种音调"" (determine this tone). The reference translation is more accurate as it correctly translates ""establish this tonality"" into Chinese.
4. The machine translation uses ""装饰式跳跃"" (decorated leap) while the reference translation uses ""装饰性跳跃"" (decorative leap). Both translations are accurate, but the reference translation is more concise.

Based on the analysis, the machine translation has some inaccuracies and is less concise compared to the reference translation. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is not as good as the reference translation.

Source: Also filmed in Technicolor with CinemaScope lenses, the film starred Lancaster, Tony Curtis and Italian sex symbol Gina Lollobrigida.
Machine translation: 这部电影也是用 Cinemaview 镜头拍摄的 ， 主演兰开斯特 ， 托尼柯蒂斯和意大利的性感标志吉娜洛洛夫里吉达。
Reference translation: 这部电影也是用宽荧幕电影镜头拍摄的，主演兰开斯特、托尼柯蒂斯和意大利的性演员志吉娜·洛洛夫里吉达。

Differences between machine translation and reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""CinemaScope"" is translated as ""Cinemaview,"" while in the reference translation, it is correctly translated as ""宽荧幕电影镜头.""
2. In the machine translation, ""性感标志"" is used to translate ""sex symbol,"" while in the reference translation, it is correctly translated as ""性演员.""

Analysis:

The machine translation has some inaccuracies in the translation of specific terms. ""CinemaScope"" should be translated as ""宽荧幕电影镜头"" and ""sex symbol"" should be translated as ""性演员."" These inaccuracies may cause some confusion for the reader and may not convey the original meaning of the source text accurately.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is not very high, as it contains some inaccuracies in the translation of specific terms. The reference translation is more accurate and conveys the original meaning of the source text better.

- The reference translation correctly translates ""feuded"" as ""had a feud,"" which accurately reflects the meaning of the source text.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation is not accurate, as it changes the meaning of the source text by incorrectly translating ""feuded"" as ""held a feast.""
- The reference translation is accurate, as it correctly translates ""feuded"" as ""had a feud"" and maintains the meaning of the source text.

Conclusion: The quality of the machine translation is poor, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is of higher quality, as it accurately translates the source text and maintains its meaning.

2. The machine translation uses ""场外球员"" (outfielder) for ""outfielder Michael Morse,"" while the reference translation correctly separates the position and the player's name by using ""外野手"" (outfielder) and ""迈克尔·莫尔斯"" (Michael Morse).

3. The machine translation uses ""投手"" (pitcher) for ""starting pitcher Tim Hudson,"" while the reference translation correctly specifies the role of the player as ""首发投手"" (starting pitcher) and uses the full name ""蒂姆·哈德森"" (Tim Hudson).

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation provides more specific information and correctly separates the position and player's name. The machine translation has some errors in the translation of the player's roles and names.

Machine translation: 两个子宫角与两个子宫颈相通, 形成一条阴道.
Reference translation: 两个子宫角与两个子宫颈相通，并形成一条阴道管。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""阴道"" (vagina) while the reference translation uses ""阴道管"" (vaginal canal).
- The machine translation omits the word ""并"" (and) from the sentence.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the term used for the vagina is minor, as ""阴道"" is a commonly used term in Chinese to refer to the vagina. However, ""阴道管"" is more specific and accurate in this context, as it refers to the canal within the vagina.
- The omission of the word ""并"" (and) changes the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the two uterine horns and two cervixes are connected, rather than that they form a single vaginal canal. This is a significant error in the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation due to the omission of an important word and the use of a less specific term. The quality of the machine translation is therefore lower than that of the reference translation.

Reference translation: 之后，哈维尔（Havel）移居美国，与她一起前往芝加哥。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. The machine translation uses ""后来"" (later) while the reference translation uses ""之后"" (afterward) to indicate the time sequence.
2. The machine translation uses ""移民"" (immigrate) while the reference translation uses ""移居"" (emigrate) to describe Havel's action.
3. The machine translation uses ""和她一起去了"" (and she went with) while the reference translation uses ""与她一起前往"" (accompanied by her) to describe the relationship between Havel and the person mentioned.
4. The machine translation uses ""芝加哥"" (Chicago) while the reference translation uses the same name for the city.

Step 3: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.
1. The use of ""后来"" instead of ""之后"" is a minor difference and does not significantly affect the meaning.
2. The use of ""移民"" instead of ""移居"" is a slight difference in word choice, but both words convey the same general meaning.
3. The use of ""和她一起去了"" instead of ""与她一起前往"" is a more significant difference. ""和她一起去了"" implies that Havel went with the person to Chicago, while ""与她一起前往"" implies that Havel accompanied the person to Chicago. The reference translation is more accurate in conveying the relationship between Havel and the person mentioned.
4. The use of ""芝加哥"" is correct and does not affect the meaning.

Machine translation: 前 59 年、 48 年、 46 年、 45 年和 44 年的领事盖尤斯 · 朱利叶斯 · 凯撒 ， 前 49 年和 47 年至 44 年的独裁者。

Reference translation: 盖乌斯·朱利叶斯C.f.C.n.凯撒，公元前59、48、46、45和44年担任执政官，公元前49年以及公元前47至44年为独裁者。

Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""领事"" (ambassador) for ""consul,"" while the reference translation uses ""执政官"" (executive official) which is more accurate.
2. The machine translation uses ""前"" (before) to indicate the years, while the reference translation uses ""公元前"" (BC) which is the standard way to indicate years before Christ.
3. The machine translation uses ""独裁者"" (dictator) for ""dictator,"" while the reference translation uses ""独裁者"" as well, which is accurate.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but there are some differences in the choice of words and the way years are indicated. The machine translation could be improved by using ""执政官"" for ""consul"" and ""公元前"" for ""BC"" to better match the reference translation.

Source: On June 17, Nixon's Plumbers were caught burglarizing the DNC offices in the Watergate.
Machine translation: 6 月 17 日 ， 尼克松的管道工在水门事件中盗窃了 DNC 的办公室。
Reference translation: 6月17日，尼克松的“水管工”在水门事件中盗窃DNC的办公室被抓。

Analysis:
1. Both the machine translation and reference translation accurately convey the main idea of the source, which is that Nixon's Plumbers were caught burglarizing the DNC offices in the Watergate on June 17.
2. The machine translation uses ""尼克松的管道工"" (Nixon's pipeline workers) to translate ""Nixon's Plumbers,"" while the reference translation uses ""尼克松的“水管工”"" (Nixon's ""water pipe workers""). The reference translation is more accurate, as ""Plumbers"" is a nickname for the group of people who broke into the DNC offices, and they were called ""water pipe workers"" because they worked for the Nixon administration's ""Plumbers"" group, which was responsible for fixing leaks in government information.
3. The machine translation omits the part about the Plumbers being caught, which is an important detail in the source. The reference translation includes this detail, stating that the Plumbers were caught in the act.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has some minor issues. The translation of ""Plumbers"" as ""管道工"" (pipeline workers) is not entirely accurate, and the omission of the Plumbers being caught is a significant detail that should have been included. The reference translation is more accurate and captures the full meaning of the source.

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""热泉"" (hot springs) while the reference translation uses ""温泉"" (thermal springs). Although these terms are similar, they are not exactly the same.
2. The machine translation says ""瓦奇塔斜坡"" (Ouachita slope) while the reference translation says ""瓦希塔州"" (Ouachita state). The machine translation is missing the ""州"" (state) part, which is important for the correct understanding of the location.
3. The machine translation says ""一个翻转的大背斜的跳动顶峰上"" (a flipped large sloping jumping peak) while the reference translation says ""一条大型倾覆背斜的顶峰线中"" (a large-scale overturned sloping peak line). The machine translation is less accurate in describing the location of the thermal springs.
4. The machine translation says ""形成的"" (formed) while the reference translation says ""冒出来的"" (emerge). The machine translation is not capturing the meaning of the source text accurately.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It has some differences in the choice of words and the description of the location, which affect the overall meaning and quality of the translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: Kiev Cossack revolt and national awakening in Ukraine
Machine translation: 乌克兰基辅哥萨克起义和国家觉醒
Reference translation: 基辅哥萨克人起义和乌克兰的民族觉醒

Step 2: Identify the key elements in the source.
- Kiev Cossack revolt
- national awakening
- Ukraine

Step 3: Compare the key elements in the machine translation and reference translation.

Machine translation:
- 乌克兰基辅哥萨克起义 (Kiev Cossack revolt)
- 国家觉醒 (national awakening)
- 乌克兰 (Ukraine)

Reference translation:
- 基辅哥萨克人起义 (Kiev Cossack revolt)
- 乌克兰的民族觉醒 (national awakening in Ukraine)
- 乌克兰 (Ukraine)

Step 4: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, ""乌克兰基辅哥萨克起义"" (Ukraine Kiev Cossack revolt) is used, which combines ""Ukraine"" and ""Kiev Cossack revolt"" into one phrase. In the reference translation, ""基辅哥萨克人起义"" (Kiev Cossack revolt) is used, which is more accurate as it separates the location (Kiev) from the event (Cossack revolt).

2. In the machine translation, ""国家觉醒"" (national awakening) is used, which is a more general term. In the reference translation, ""乌克兰的民族觉醒"" (national awakening in Ukraine) is used, which is more specific and accurate as it specifies the location (Ukraine) for the national awakening.

Step 5: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It combines ""Ukraine"" and ""Kiev Cossack revolt"" into one phrase, which is not as clear as the reference translation. Additionally, the machine translation uses a more general term for ""national awakening"" without specifying the location (Ukraine), which makes it less accurate.

Overall, the machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation due to the differences in the key elements and their specificity.

Source: In Stillwater, Raven Creek empties into the creek from the northeast, 18.62 mi above the mouth.
Machine translation: 在斯蒂沃特, Raven 溪从东北的口以上 18.62 米的地方倒进了小溪.
Reference translation: 在Stillwater，RavenCreek从东北方向流入河口上方18.62英里处。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation uses ""小溪"" (creek) while the reference translation uses ""河口"" (mouth of the river).
- Machine translation uses ""18.62 米"" (18.62 meters) while the reference translation uses ""18.62英里"" (18.62 miles).
- Machine translation uses ""倒进了"" (empties into) while the reference translation uses ""流入"" (flows into).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation correctly captures the main idea of the source text, which is that Raven Creek empties into another creek from the northeast, 18.62 mi above the mouth.
- However, the machine translation uses ""小溪"" (creek) instead of ""河口"" (mouth of the river), which is a less accurate translation.
- The machine translation uses ""18.62 米"" (18.62 meters) instead of ""18.62英里"" (18.62 miles), which is also less accurate.
- The machine translation uses ""倒进了"" (empties into) instead of ""流入"" (flows into), which is a slightly less accurate translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate but has some minor inaccuracies in the choice of words and units of measurement. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using more accurate translations for ""river mouth,"" ""miles,"" and ""flows into.""

- The machine translation also uses pinyin for the names, which may not be as easily recognizable for some readers compared to the original names in the reference translation.

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate but has some room for improvement in terms of capturing the essence of the role and using the original names.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: The critic praised Hollyoaks writers for the ""stroke of genius"" pairing Grace and Trevor.
Machine translation: 这位评论家赞扬好莱坞的作家将格雷斯和特雷弗 ""巧妙"" 结合在一起。
Reference translation: 评论家称赞Hollyoaks作家，格蕾丝（Grace）和特雷弗（Trevor）配对的“天才之笔”。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 这位评论家赞扬好莱坞的作家将格雷斯和特雷弗 ""巧妙"" 结合在一起。
- Reference translation: 评论家称赞Hollyoaks作家，格蕾丝（Grace）和特雷弗（Trevor）配对的“天才之笔”。

Differences:
1. Machine translation uses ""好莱坞"" (Hollywood) instead of ""Hollyoaks"".
2. Machine translation uses ""巧妙"" (clever) instead of ""天才之笔"" (stroke of genius).
3. Machine translation does not include the names ""Grace"" and ""Trevor"" in parentheses.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""好莱坞"" (Hollywood) instead of ""Hollyoaks"" is a minor error, as both are related to the entertainment industry. However, it is not accurate to the source text.
2. The use of ""巧妙"" (clever) instead of ""天才之笔"" (stroke of genius) changes the meaning of the translation. ""Stroke of genius"" implies a brilliant and unexpected idea, while ""clever"" is a more general term for intelligence or skill.
3. The omission of the names ""Grace"" and ""Trevor"" in parentheses makes the translation less clear and less accurate to the source text.

Conclusion: The machine translation has some minor errors and is not as accurate as the reference translation. The quality of the machine translation is not high.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, I will first read and understand the source, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation to determine the quality of the machine translation.

Source: Previously, Englishmen had drunk mainly dark stout and porter beers, but pale ale came to predominate.
Machine translation: 以前, 英国人主要喝醉了黑胖的啤酒, 而淡淡的啤酒却占了主导地位.
Reference translation: 以前，英国人主要喝醉了黑胖的啤酒，而淡淡的啤酒却占了主导地位。

Upon reading the source, machine translation, and reference translation, I notice that the machine translation is almost identical to the reference translation. The only difference is the use of the character ""了"" in the machine translation, which is not present in the reference translation. This character is often used to indicate that the action has been completed or is in the past.

In this case, the presence of ""了"" in the machine translation does not change the meaning of the sentence, and the overall translation quality is high. The machine translation accurately captures the meaning of the source text and is very close to the reference translation.

Therefore, I would rate the quality of the English-Chinese translation as excellent.

Source: Meanwhile, the British captured the Great Redan, just south of the city of Sevastopol.
Machine translation: 与此同时 ， 英国人占领了位于塞瓦斯托波尔市南部的大雷丹。
Reference translation: 同时，英国人占领了塞瓦斯托波尔市以南的大雷丹（GreatRedan）。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""与此同时"" (with this at the same time) while the reference translation uses ""同时"" (at the same time).
- The machine translation uses ""位于"" (located at) while the reference translation uses ""以南的"" (south of).
- The machine translation does not include the word ""Great"" before ""Redan"" while the reference translation does.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the use of ""与此同时"" and ""同时"" does not significantly impact the meaning or quality of the translation.
- The difference in the use of ""位于"" and ""以南的"" does impact the quality of the translation. ""位于"" implies that the Great Redan is a specific location within the city, while ""以南的"" correctly conveys that the Great Redan is just south of the city.
- The omission of the word ""Great"" before ""Redan"" in the machine translation is a significant error, as it changes the meaning of the translation. The Great Redan is a specific historical landmark, and the omission of ""Great"" makes the translation less accurate.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of moderate quality. It captures the general meaning of the source text, but there are some significant errors in the translation, particularly in the omission of the word ""Great"" before ""Redan"" and the use of ""位于"" instead of ""以南的"" to describe the location of the Great Redan.

The source sentence states that ""boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles at or near the surface."" The machine translation conveys the same meaning, but the structure of the sentence is slightly different. The machine translation says ""船运和疏浚使栖息地退化，当船只与海龟在水面或附近碰撞时也会伤害或杀死海龟。"" which translates to ""Boat traffic and dredging make the habitat degrade, and when the boats collide with turtles at or near the surface, they can also injure or kill turtles."" 

The difference between the machine translation and the reference translation is the placement of the phrase ""当船只与海龟在水面或附近碰撞时"" (when the boats collide with turtles at or near the surface). In the reference translation, this phrase is placed after the phrase ""boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat,"" while in the machine translation, it is placed after the phrase ""boat traffic and dredging make the habitat degrade."" 

Despite this slight difference in sentence structure, the machine translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. The translation is accurate and captures the key points of the source text.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Machine translation: 相反, 氧化血红蛋白表现出抗磁性, 这是一种来自磁场的微弱排斥.
Reference translation: 相反，含氧血红蛋白表现出反磁性，即磁场的弱排斥力。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""抗磁性"" (antimagnetic) while the reference translation uses ""反磁性"" (diamagnetic).
- The machine translation says ""这是一种来自磁场的微弱排斥"" (this is a kind of weak repulsion from the magnetic field) while the reference translation says ""即磁场的弱排斥力"" (the weak repulsion force of the magnetic field).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The term ""抗磁性"" (antimagnetic) is not the same as ""反磁性"" (diamagnetic). Diamagnetism is a specific type of magnetic behavior, while antimagnetic is a more general term that could refer to any type of opposition to magnetic fields.
- The machine translation's description of the weak repulsion from the magnetic field is less precise than the reference translation's description of the weak repulsion force of the magnetic field.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The use of ""抗磁性"" (antimagnetic) instead of ""反磁性"" (diamagnetic) leads to a less precise translation of the original source. Additionally, the description of the weak repulsion from the magnetic field is less precise than the reference translation's description of the weak repulsion force of the magnetic field. Overall, the quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation.

1. In the machine translation, the term ""Bench"" is translated as ""法官席"" (judge's bench), while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""榻榻米"" (bench). This is a significant difference as ""Bench"" does not refer to a judge's bench in this context.

2. In the machine translation, ""Rialto Bench"" is translated as ""Rialto 法官席"" (Rialto judge's bench), while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""RialtoBench"". This is a minor difference, but it is important to maintain the original term ""RialtoBench"" in the translation.

3. The machine translation uses ""底线街"" (base line street) for ""Base Line Street"", while the reference translation uses ""BaseLineStreet"". This is a minor difference, but it is important to maintain the original name of the street in the translation.

Overall, the machine translation has some significant differences from the reference translation, particularly in the translation of ""Bench"" and ""Rialto Bench"". The machine translation also has minor differences in the translation of ""Base Line Street"". Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is not as high as the reference translation.

Reference translation: 哥伦布在横渡大西洋的旅程中使用了一艘“圣玛丽亚号”和两艘轻快帆船“平塔号”和“尼娜号”。

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, ""圣玛丽亚号"" is translated as ""圣玛丽亚号"" (Santa Maria), which is correct.
2. In the machine translation, ""平塔号"" is translated as ""平塔号"" (Pinta), which is correct.
3. In the machine translation, ""尼尼亚号"" is translated as ""尼尼亚号"" (Niña), which is correct.
4. In the machine translation, ""大篷车"" is used to translate ""nau"" and ""caravels."" ""大篷车"" means ""sailboat"" or ""caravel"" in Chinese, but it does not accurately convey the meaning of ""nau."" The reference translation uses ""轻快帆船"" (light sailing ship) to better capture the meaning of ""nau"" and ""caravels.""

Overall, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but it does not fully capture the meaning of ""nau"" and ""caravels."" The reference translation provides a more accurate translation of these terms.

Machine translation: 11 月 17 日 ， 他们沿着詹姆士河从 Kecoughan 启航。
Reference translation: 他们于11月17日从凯科夫丹（Kecoughtan）沿着詹姆斯河（JamesRiver）航行。

Step 1: Compare the date format
Source: on 17 November
Machine translation: 11 月 17 日
Reference translation: 11月17日
The machine translation correctly translates the date format as ""11 月 17 日,"" which is the standard Chinese format for dates.

Step 2: Compare the location names
Source: Kecoughtan, along the James River
Machine translation: Kecoughan
Reference translation: 凯科夫丹（Kecoughtan）
The machine translation incorrectly translates ""Kecoughtan"" as ""Kecoughan."" The reference translation correctly translates it as ""凯科夫丹（Kecoughtan）.""

Step 3: Compare the action
Source: sailed
Machine translation: 沿着詹姆士河从 Kecoughan 启航
Reference translation: 沿着詹姆斯河（JamesRiver）航行
The machine translation correctly translates the action of sailing as ""启航,"" but it incorrectly translates the preposition ""along"" as ""沿着詹姆士河,"" which is not the correct translation for ""along the James River."" The reference translation correctly translates it as ""沿着詹姆斯河（JamesRiver）.""

In conclusion, the machine translation has some discrepancies with the reference translation.

- Machine translation: 他像一只身穿黄色头罩的人形狐狸.
- Reference translation: 他像一个穿着黄色连帽长袍的人形狐狸。

Differences:
1. Machine translation uses ""一只"" (one) while the reference translation uses ""一个"" (one) to describe the humanoid fox.
2. Machine translation uses ""身穿黄色头罩的"" (wearing a yellow hood) while the reference translation uses ""穿着黄色连帽长袍的"" (wearing a yellow hooded robe) to describe the clothing of the humanoid fox.

Step 3: Analyze the quality of the machine translation based on the differences.
1. The use of ""一只"" (one) in the machine translation is not incorrect, but it is less specific than ""一个"" (one) in the reference translation. The reference translation provides more information about the humanoid fox being one of its kind.
2. The machine translation omits the ""长袍"" (robe) part of the description, which is an important detail in the source text. The reference translation accurately captures the source text by including both ""黄色连帽"" (yellow hood) and ""长袍"" (robe).

Conclusion: The machine translation is not of high quality because it omits important details from the source text and is less specific in some parts. The reference translation is a better representation of the source text, making it the higher quality translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

Reference translation: 他们在离要塞七公里的地方降落在一条隐蔽的小溪里。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""7 公里"" (7 km) while the reference translation uses ""七公里"" (seven kilometers).
- The machine translation uses ""地方降落"" (landed in the place) while the reference translation uses ""降落在一条"" (landed in a).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the measurement of distance (7 km vs. seven kilometers) is a minor issue and does not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation.
- The difference in the phrasing ""地方降落"" vs. ""降落在一条"" is more significant. The machine translation's ""地方降落"" (landed in the place) could be interpreted as they landed at the location of the fort, while the reference translation's ""降落在一条"" (landed in a) makes it clear that they landed in a hidden creek, not at the fort itself.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but the phrasing difference could lead to a slight misunderstanding of the original meaning. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but there is room for improvement in conveying the exact meaning of the source text.

Reference translation: 包装工队在距离费夫尔家乡很近的路易斯安那州超级球馆晋级第三十一届超级。

Differences:

1. In the machine translation, ""包装商"" (packaging merchants) is used instead of ""包装工队"" (packers) in the reference translation. This is a significant difference as ""packers"" refers to the Green Bay Packers, an American football team, while ""packaging merchants"" does not convey the same meaning.

2. In the machine translation, ""超级圆顶"" (super dome) is used instead of ""超级球馆"" (super stadium) in the reference translation. While both terms refer to the Louisiana Superdome, ""超级圆顶"" is more specific to the dome-shaped structure, while ""超级球馆"" is more general and could refer to any super stadium.

3. In the machine translation, ""超级碗第三十一号"" (Super Bowl XXXI) is used correctly, matching the source text.

4. In the machine translation, ""这是一个从费夫尔的家乡的一个简短的驱动器"" (this is a short drive from Favre's hometown) is used instead of ""距离费夫尔家乡很近的"" (very close to Favre's hometown) in the reference translation. The machine translation correctly conveys the meaning of the source text, while the reference translation is less precise.

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""穆罕默德"" (Mohammed) is used instead of ""莫霍克族"" (Mohawk) in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as Mohammed is not related to the context of the source text.
2. In the machine translation, ""图斯卡罗拉"" (Tuscarora) is written correctly, but the tone mark (ㄠ) is missing, which is important in Chinese to indicate the correct pronunciation.
3. The machine translation correctly translates ""80 white Loyalists"" as ""80 名白人忠贞主义者"" (80 names white loyalist), but the reference translation uses ""忠诚主义者"" (faithful believers) instead of ""忠贞主义者"" (loyalists). This is a minor difference in meaning.

In conclusion, the machine translation has some inaccuracies and differences compared to the reference translation. The translation of ""Mohawk"" to ""Mohammed"" is a significant error, and the missing tone mark for ""Tuscarora"" is another issue. The difference in the translation of ""Loyalists"" is a minor issue.

3. In the machine translation, the phrase ""黄蜂和蟹就会萎缩"" is used, while the reference translation uses ""黄蜂和螃蟹就会枯萎."" Both phrases mean ""wasps and crabs will shrivel up,"" but ""枯萎"" (wither) might be a more accurate translation for ""shrivel up"" than ""萎缩"" (shrink).

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not entirely accurate in conveying the meaning of the source text. The use of ""消退"" and ""死了"" would have been more accurate translations for ""wanes"" and ""dies,"" respectively. Additionally, the use of ""枯萎"" instead of ""萎缩"" would have been a more accurate translation for ""shrivel up.""

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: He also criticized western feminists protesting the burqa.
Machine translation: 他还批评西方女权主义者抗议布卡。
Reference translation: 他还批评了西方女权主义者关于穿着罩袍的抗议行为。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 他还批评西方女权主义者抗议布卡。
- Reference translation: 他还批评了西方女权主义者关于穿着罩袍的抗议行为。

Difference 1: The machine translation uses ""抗议布卡"" (protesting the burqa), while the reference translation uses ""关于穿着罩袍的抗议行为"" (protesting about wearing the veil).

Difference 2: The machine translation uses ""他还批评"" (he also criticized), while the reference translation uses ""他还批评了"" (he also criticized).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- Difference 1: The machine translation is less specific than the reference translation. The reference translation mentions ""protesting about wearing the veil,"" which is more accurate than the machine translation's ""protesting the burqa."" The burqa is a specific type of veil, and the reference translation includes the broader concept of ""wearing the veil.""
- Difference 2: The difference in the verb phrase ""他还批评"" (he also criticized) and ""他还批评了"" (he also criticized) does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence. Both phrases convey the same idea that the person criticized something.

Conclusion: The machine translation is less accurate than the reference translation due to its lack of specificity in describing the protest. The reference translation provides a more accurate and detailed description of the protest, making it a higher quality translation.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, we need to compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify any differences.

Source: Meanwhile, in the ponds and lakes, fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles.

Machine translation: 同时 ， 在池塘和湖泊中 ， 青蛙的数量减少意味着苔藓的数量减少。

Reference translation: 同时，在池塘和湖泊中，青蛙的数量减少意味着蝌蚪的数量减少。

Difference: The machine translation uses the term ""苔藓"" (tào tóu) instead of ""蝌蚪"" (chuān bèn) in the translation. ""苔藓"" refers to moss, while ""蝌蚪"" refers to tadpoles.

Analysis: The machine translation is different from the reference translation because it uses the wrong term for tadpoles. The reference translation correctly uses ""蝌蚪"" to refer to tadpoles, while the machine translation incorrectly uses ""苔藓"" which means moss. This difference in translation could lead to confusion for the reader, as moss and tadpoles are not the same thing.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not accurate in this case, as it uses the wrong term for tadpoles. The reference translation is more accurate and should be used as the correct translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: She supposedly dies in a shipwreck in the episode ""Chemistry"".
Machine translation: 据说她死于 ""化学"" 一集中的沉船事故.
Reference translation: 据推测，她在《化学》一集中死于沉船事故。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. The machine translation uses ""据说"" (supposedly) while the reference translation uses ""据推测"" (as per speculation).
2. The machine translation uses ""化学"" (chemistry) as the name of the episode, while the reference translation uses ""《化学》"" (Chemistry), indicating it as a title.
3. The machine translation omits the word ""一集中"" (in the episode), which is present in the reference translation.

Step 4: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""据说"" vs. ""据推测"" does not significantly impact the meaning, but the reference translation is more accurate in using ""据推测"" to indicate speculation.
2. The machine translation's use of ""化学"" without the title markers is less accurate than the reference translation, which correctly indicates the episode title with ""《化学》"".
3. The omission of ""一集中"" in the machine translation makes the sentence less clear, as it does not specify that the shipwreck occurs in the episode.

Overall, the machine translation is less accurate than the reference translation due to the differences mentioned above. The machine translation does convey the main idea of the source text, but it lacks the clarity and accuracy of the reference translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation carefully.

Source: This task would reappear in Season 21 as a switchback.
Machine translation: 这项任务将作为回调在 21 季度重新出现.
Reference translation: 该任务将在第21季重新出现，作为切回。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""回调"" (return call) while the reference translation uses ""切回"" (switchback).
2. The machine translation uses ""21 季度"" (21 quarter) while the reference translation uses ""第21季"" (the 21st season).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""回调"" instead of ""切回"" changes the meaning of the sentence. ""回调"" means to return to a previous state or situation, while ""切回"" means to switch back to a previous state or situation. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of ""switchback"" as used in the source.
2. The use of ""21 季度"" instead of ""第21季"" is a minor error, but it still changes the meaning of the sentence. ""21 季度"" refers to the 21st quarter of a year, while ""第21季"" refers to the 21st season of a TV show or series. The reference translation correctly captures the meaning of ""Season 21"" as used in the source.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not accurate and does not correctly capture the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and better reflects the meaning of the source text.

Reference translation: 温哥华在明尼苏达州的野外比赛中打了一仗，然后在四月份退出比赛并赢得区分冠军。

Analysis:
1. Both the machine translation and reference translation correctly convey the main idea of the source, which is that Vancouver competed with the Minnesota Wild in the standings and eventually won the division in April.
2. The main difference between the machine translation and reference translation is in the phrase ""pulling away in April and winning the division."" The machine translation uses ""拉开比赛并赢得了比赛"" (pulled away and won the game), while the reference translation uses ""退出比赛并赢得区分冠军"" (withdrew from the competition and won the division championship).
3. The machine translation's choice of words is less accurate than the reference translation, as it does not clearly convey the idea of ""winning the division"" and instead focuses on ""winning the game.""
4. The reference translation is more accurate in conveying the idea of ""winning the division championship"" by using the phrase ""退出比赛并赢得区分冠军"" (withdrew from the competition and won the division championship).

Conclusion:
The machine translation is less accurate than the reference translation in conveying the main idea of the source. The reference translation is more accurate in conveying the idea of ""winning the division championship"" and should be considered the better translation.

2. The machine translation has a typo in ""Exportof"" instead of ""Exports"".

Step 3: Analyze the impact of these differences on the overall quality of the translation.

1. The omission of the phrase ""After Parley on Arms Needs"" changes the context of the title, as it no longer indicates that the decision to curb steel exports was made after a discussion on arms needs. This omission may lead to confusion for readers who are trying to understand the reason behind the U.S. curbing steel exports.
2. The typo in ""Exportof"" instead of ""Exports"" is a minor error that does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the title. However, it may cause slight confusion for readers who are not familiar with the correct spelling of ""exports"".

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation based on the analysis.

The machine translation is of moderate quality. While it captures the main idea of the source, it omits important context and contains a minor spelling error. The reference translation provides a more accurate and complete representation of the source.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, we need to compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify the differences.

Source: Carapace shape changes with growth, with vertebral scutes becoming narrower and pleural scutes becoming larger during late ontogeny.

Machine translation: 颈部形状随生长而变化 ， 椎体节节变窄 ， 胸膜节节变大。

Reference translation: 胴体形状随着生长而变化，在发育后期，椎体鳞片变得更窄，胸膜鳞片变得更大。

Differences:

1. The machine translation mentions ""颈部形状"" (neck shape) while the source and reference translation mention ""胴体形状"" (carapace shape).
2. The machine translation uses ""椎体节节"" (vertebral nodes) while the source and reference translation use ""椎体鳞片"" (vertebral scutes).
3. The machine translation uses ""胸膜节节"" (pleural nodes) while the source and reference translation use ""胸膜鳞片"" (pleural scutes).

The machine translation is different from the reference translation in terms of the specific terms used to describe the carapace shape and the scutes. The machine translation uses ""nodes"" instead of ""scutes"" and ""neck shape"" instead of ""carapace shape."" These differences may lead to confusion and misunderstanding of the original meaning.

Overall, the quality of the machine translation is not satisfactory, as it does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and should be used as a better representation of the original source.

Machine translation: 晚期罗马防御工事的主要特征清楚地预示着中世纪种姓的特征.
Reference translation: 晚期罗马防御工事的主要特征清楚地预示着中世纪城堡的特征。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
In the machine translation, the term ""种姓"" (kinds of people) is used, while the reference translation uses ""城堡"" (castles).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
The term ""种姓"" (kinds of people) is not an accurate translation of ""castles"" in this context. The reference translation, ""城堡"" (castles), is more appropriate as it refers to the specific architectural structures that were built during the medieval period.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not accurate in this case, as it does not correctly translate the term ""castles"" to ""城堡."" This results in a loss of meaning and context in the translation.

Step 5: Provide a conclusion.
The quality of the English-Chinese translation is not satisfactory, as the machine translation does not accurately convey the meaning of the source text. The reference translation is more accurate and should be used instead.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation correctly captures the main idea of the source text, which is that camels with breeding pedigrees may be very valuable, similar to racehorses.
- However, the machine translation uses the term ""饲养宠物的骆驼"" (cultivated pets' camels) instead of ""有繁育血统的骆驼"" (camels with breeding pedigrees). This is a minor difference, but it slightly changes the meaning of the sentence. ""饲养宠物的骆驼"" implies that the camels are pets that are raised and cared for, while ""有繁育血统的骆驼"" specifically refers to camels that have a breeding pedigree or lineage.
- The machine translation also uses ""可能很有价值"" (may be very valuable) instead of ""可能非常有价值"" (may be very valuable). This is a minor difference, and the meaning is still the same.

Machine translation: 在位置和情境的超级科之下, 黑人捕捉了白人群体.
Reference translation: 在位置和形式超子下，黑子抓住了白子。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 情境 (situation) vs 形式 (form)
- Machine translation: 超级科 (super ko) vs 超子 (super sub)
- Machine translation: 黑人 (black person) vs 黑子 (black piece)
- Machine translation: 白人群体 (white people group) vs 白子 (white piece)

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation uses ""情境"" (situation) instead of ""形式"" (form), which is more appropriate in the context of the source text.
- The machine translation uses ""超级科"" (super ko) instead of ""超子"" (super sub), which is a more accurate translation of the term used in the source text.
- The machine translation uses ""黑人"" (black person) instead of ""黑子"" (black piece), which is not appropriate in the context of the source text.
- The machine translation uses ""白人群体"" (white people group) instead of ""白子"" (white piece), which is not appropriate in the context of the source text.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has some inaccuracies and inappropriate word choices, which affect the overall quality of the translation. The reference translation is more accurate and appropriate in the context of the source text.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, we need to compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify the differences.

Source: Citrus trees such as orange, lemon and grapefruit thrive on the coastal plain.
Machine translation: 柑橘、柠檬树和葡萄树等柑橘树在海岸平原上兴旺.
Reference translation: 柑橘、柠檬树和葡萄树等柑橘类乔木在海岸平原上欣欣向荣。

Differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. The machine translation mentions ""葡萄树"" (grape tree) while the source and reference translation mention ""grapefruit."" This is a significant difference as grapefruit is a type of citrus fruit, not a tree.
2. The machine translation uses the phrase ""柑橘树"" (citrus tree) while the source and reference translation use the phrase ""柑橘类乔木"" (citrus-type trees). This difference is minor, but it is more accurate to use the phrase ""柑橘类乔木"" as it specifies the type of trees being discussed.
3. The machine translation uses the phrase ""兴旺"" (thriving) while the reference translation uses the phrase ""欣欣向荣"" (flourishing). Both phrases convey a similar meaning, but ""欣欣向荣"" is more idiomatic and accurate in this context.

Overall, the machine translation has some inaccuracies and is not as close to the reference translation as it could be. The translation quality can be improved by addressing these differences and ensuring the translation is more accurate and idiomatic.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: 40 Infantry Regiments, two battalions of the Vukassovich Nr.
Machine translation: 40 步兵团, Vukassovich Nr 的两个营。
Reference translation: 第40步兵团，VukassovichNr.的两个营。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""步兵团"" (infantry regiment) while the reference translation uses ""第40步兵团"" (40th infantry regiment).
- The machine translation uses ""Vukassovich Nr 的两个营"" (two battalions of the Vukassovich Nr) while the reference translation uses ""VukassovichNr.的两个营"" (two battalions of the Vukassovich Nr).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The machine translation omits the ""第"" (number) before ""40步兵团"" (infantry regiment), which makes it less specific than the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""的"" (of) before ""两个营"" (two battalions), which is grammatically correct but slightly different from the reference translation, which uses ""VukassovichNr."" instead of ""Vukassovich Nr"".

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the specificity of the reference translation. The difference in the use of ""步兵团"" and ""第40步兵团"" is a minor issue, but it does make the machine translation less precise. The difference in the use of ""Vukassovich Nr"" and ""VukassovichNr"" is a minor formatting issue that does not affect the overall meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is of good quality, but it could be improved by adding the number before ""步兵团"" to make it more specific like the reference translation.

Machine translation: 山姆救了这只小牛 ， 不让它淹死在流沙里 ， 她后来变成了山姆的。
Reference translation: 山姆救了这只小牛，不让它淹死在流沙里，她后来变成了山姆的。

The difference is the placement of the comma after ""小牛"" (calf) and ""流沙里"" (in quicksand). In the machine translation, the comma is placed after ""小牛"" and ""流沙里,"" while in the reference translation, the comma is placed after ""小牛"" and before ""不让它淹死在流沙里.""

The placement of the comma in the machine translation makes the sentence structure slightly different from the reference translation. However, the overall meaning of the sentence is still clear and understandable. The difference in comma placement may be due to the differences in grammar rules between English and Chinese, as well as the translation software's ability to accurately capture the intended meaning of the source text.

Source: He also drummed on the song ""Bad Boyfriend"" on Garbage's 2005 album Bleed Like Me.
Machine translation: 他还吹嘘了《垃圾》 2005 年专辑中的 ""坏男友"" 一曲。
Reference translation: 他还为Garbage2005年的专辑《BleedLikeMe》中的歌曲“BadBoyfriend”打鼓。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""吹嘘了"" (blowed) while the reference translation uses ""打鼓"" (drummed).
2. The machine translation uses ""垃圾"" (garbage) instead of ""Garbage"" as the band name.
3. The machine translation uses ""2005 年专辑中的"" (in the 2005 album) while the reference translation uses ""Garbage2005年的专辑"" (Garbage's 2005 album).
4. The machine translation uses ""一曲"" (one song) while the reference translation does not specify the number of songs.

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

1. The use of ""吹嘘了"" instead of ""打鼓"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as ""吹嘘了"" implies that the person boasted about the song, while ""打鼓"" means that the person played drums on the song.
2. The use of ""垃圾"" instead of ""Garbage"" as the band name is a mistake, as ""垃圾"" means ""garbage"" in Chinese, which is not the name of the band.
3. The use of ""2005 年专辑中的"" instead of ""Garbage2005年的专辑"" changes the meaning of the sentence, as it implies that the song is in any album from 2005, not specifically Garbage's 2005 album.
4. The use of ""一曲"" adds unnecessary information to the sentence, as it is not mentioned in the source or reference translation.

731	"GPT4 Correct User: A large language model did an evaluation of the English-Chinese translation, which is given as below:
 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: He has a white sheepdog named Hot Dog and a younger sister, Forsythia ""Jellybean"" Jones.
Machine translation: 他有一只叫热狗的白羊狗和一个妹妹福西西亚 ""大豆豆"" 琼斯。
Reference translation: 他有一个白色的牧羊犬，名为“热狗”，还有一个妹妹，名叫福西娅·“软糖”·琼斯。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. The machine translation uses ""福西西亚"" for ""Forsythia"", while the reference translation uses ""福西娅"".
2. The machine translation uses ""大豆豆"" for ""Jellybean"", while the reference translation uses ""软糖"".
3. The machine translation does not include the word ""牧羊犬"" (sheepdog) before ""热狗"".
4. The machine translation does not include the word ""名为"" before ""热狗"".
5. The machine translation does not include the word ""还有一个"" before ""妹妹"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The difference in the name ""福西西亚"" vs. ""福西娅"" does not significantly impact the meaning, but the reference translation is more accurate.
2. The difference in the name ""大豆豆"" vs. ""软糖"" does not significantly impact the meaning, but the reference translation is more accurate.
3. The omission of ""牧羊犬"" before ""热狗"" makes the machine translation less clear, as it does not specify that it is a sheepdog.
4. The omission of ""名为"" before ""热狗"" also makes the machine translation less clear, as it does not specify that ""热狗"" is the name of the sheepdog.
5. The omission of ""还有一个"" before ""妹妹"" makes the machine translation less clear, as it does not specify that the younger sister is a separate entity.

Conclusion: The machine translation is less accurate and clear than the reference translation due to the omissions mentioned above. The quality of the machine translation is therefore lower than that of the reference translation.

Source: The octagonal 'GP' logo also returned to the taillights.
Machine translation: 八角形的 ""GP"" 标志也返回尾灯。
Reference translation: 八角形的""GP""标志也返回尾灯。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
The machine translation and reference translation are almost identical, with only one minor difference:

Machine translation: 八角形的 ""GP"" 标志也返回尾灯。

Reference translation: 2017年，他与查宁·塔图姆和亚当·德瑞福一同出演了史蒂文·索德伯格(StevenSoderbergh)的抢劫喜剧《幸运的罗根》(LoganLuky)。

Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""洛根幸运报"" (Logan Luki) for the title of the movie, while the reference translation uses ""幸运的罗根"" (LoganLuky). The reference translation seems to be more accurate, as it correctly translates the title as ""Logan Lucky.""
2. The machine translation uses ""同时出现在"" (simultaneously appearing in) to describe the appearance of the actor alongside Channing Tatum and Adam Driver. The reference translation uses ""与...一同出演了"" (performed together with...), which is more accurate in describing the actor's collaboration with other actors in the movie.
3. The machine translation uses ""亚当 · 多佛"" (Adam · Duofo) for the name of the actor Adam Driver. The reference translation uses ""亚当·德瑞福"" (Adam·Dreyfus), which is the correct pinyin for Adam Driver's name.

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The machine translation has some errors in translating the title of the movie and the actor's name, and it uses a less accurate phrase to describe the actor's appearance in the movie.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation step by step:

1. In the source, ""Stern wrote a novelization of 'The Death of Superman', The Death and Life of Superman, in 1993.""
2. Machine translation: ""斯特恩在 1993 年写了《超人的死亡》的小说《超人的死亡与生命》。""
3. Reference translation: ""斯特恩在1993年写出了《超人之死》的小说版《超人的死亡与生命》。""

Now let's compare the machine translation and reference translation:

a. The machine translation uses ""写了"" (wrote) while the reference translation uses ""写出了"" (wrote out). Both are correct, but ""写出了"" is more appropriate in this context as it emphasizes the creation of the novelization.

b. The machine translation uses ""《超人的死亡》"" (The Death of Superman) for the title of the comic, while the reference translation uses ""《超人之死》"" (The Death of Superman). Both are correct, but the reference translation is more accurate as it matches the original English title.

c. The machine translation uses ""小说《超人的死亡与生命》"" (novel The Death and Life of Superman) for the title of the novelization, while the reference translation uses ""小说版《超人的死亡与生命》"" (novelization The Death and Life of Superman). The reference translation is more accurate as it specifies that it is a novelization, not just a novel.

Overall, the reference translation is more accurate and better conveys the meaning of the source text. The machine translation has some minor errors, but the overall meaning is still understandable.

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses ""&"" (ampersand) to separate the two phrases, while the reference translation uses ""和"" (Chinese for ""and"").
2. The machine translation uses ""服从义务的热情"" (zeal of obeying duties), while the reference translation uses ""遵守职责的热忱"" (heat of obeying duties).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
1. The use of ""&"" in the machine translation is a minor issue, as it is still understandable. However, using ""和"" in the reference translation is more natural and grammatically correct in Chinese.
2. The difference in the second phrase is more significant. The machine translation focuses on the ""zeal"" (热情) of obeying duties, while the reference translation emphasizes the ""heat"" (热忱) of obeying duties. The difference in meaning could affect the overall understanding of the translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: First she might revert to persecution of the Huguenots.
Machine translation: 首先 ， 她可能会回到迫害 Huguenot 人的地步。
Reference translation: 首先，她可能会回到迫害Huguenot人的地步。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
The machine translation is almost identical to the reference translation, with only one minor difference:

Machine translation: 首先 ， 她可能会回到迫害 Huguenot 人的地步。
Reference translation: 首先，她可能会回到迫害Huguenot人的地步。

The difference is the placement of the comma in the first part of the sentence. The machine translation has a comma after ""首先"" (first), while the reference translation has a comma after ""首先,"" (first,).

Step 3: Analyze the impact of the difference on the overall quality of the translation.
The placement of the comma in the machine translation does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentence. Both translations convey the same message: ""First, she might revert to persecution of the Huguenots.""

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
Considering the minor difference in comma placement, the machine translation is of high quality. It accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is very close to the reference translation. The difference in comma placement is a minor issue and does not significantly affect the overall quality of the translation.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: They discussed the Jesuits, Cistercians and Franciscans.
Machine translation: 他们讨论了耶稣会、政治家和方济各会。
Reference translation: 他们讨论了耶稣会士、政治家和方济各会。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
In the machine translation, the terms ""耶稣会"" (Jesuits), ""政治家"" (politician), and ""方济各会"" (Cistercians) are used. In the reference translation, the terms ""耶稣会士"" (Jesuits), ""政治家"" (politician), and ""方济各会"" (Cistercians) are used.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
The machine translation uses ""耶稣会"" (Jesuits) instead of ""耶稣会士"" (Jesuits) in the reference translation. The difference is the addition of the character ""士"" (soldier, scholar) in the reference translation, which specifies that the Jesuits being discussed are members of the Jesuit order, rather than just the order itself.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it lacks the specificity of the reference translation in terms of referring to the members of the Jesuit order. This difference in specificity may affect the overall quality of the translation, as it could lead to confusion for readers who are not familiar with the terms.

Step 5: Provide a conclusion.
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it could be improved by using the more specific term ""耶稣会士"" (Jesuits) instead of ""耶稣会"" (Jesuits) to match the reference translation. This would help to ensure that the translation is clear and accurate for readers who are not familiar with the terms.

Machine translation: 范厄普拆除并重建了上三个圆形平台和塔楼。
Reference translation: 范·埃尔普(VanErp)拆除并重建了上方的三个圆形平台和佛塔。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""范厄普"" for ""Van Erp"", while the reference translation uses ""范·埃尔普(VanErp)"".
- The machine translation uses ""塔楼"" for ""stupas"", while the reference translation uses ""佛塔"" for the same term.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- The difference in the name ""Van Erp"" can be considered a minor error, as ""范厄普"" is a phonetic approximation of ""Van Erp"" in Chinese. However, the reference translation uses ""范·埃尔普(VanErp)"", which is more accurate and includes the original name in parentheses.
- The difference in the translation of ""stupas"" to ""塔楼"" (tower) is a more significant error. ""Stupas"" are specific religious structures in Buddhism, and ""塔楼"" is not the correct term for them. The reference translation uses ""佛塔"" (Buddhist stupa), which is the correct term for stupas in Chinese.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation has some minor errors, such as the name ""Van Erp"", but the more significant error is the incorrect translation of ""stupas"" to ""塔楼"". This error affects the accuracy of the translation and could lead to confusion for the reader. The reference translation is more accurate and should be considered the better translation.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, I will first read the source, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation to determine the quality of the machine translation.

Source: Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan, 89, Indian sitar player and composer, cardiac arrest.
Machine translation: Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan, 89 岁, 印度现场播放器和作曲家, 心跳停止.
Reference translation: AbdulHalimJafferKhan，现年89岁，印度西他琴演奏家和作曲家，死于心脏骤停。

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation correctly translates the name ""Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan"" and his age ""89.""
2. The machine translation uses ""现场播放器"" (live player) instead of ""西他琴演奏家"" (sitar player) in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, as ""现场播放器"" still conveys the idea of a performer, but it is not as specific as ""西他琴演奏家.""
3. The machine translation uses ""作曲家"" (composer) for ""composer,"" which is correct.
4. The machine translation uses ""心跳停止"" (heart stop) instead of ""死于心脏骤停"" (death from cardiac arrest) in the reference translation. This is a significant difference, as ""心跳停止"" does not convey the same meaning as ""death from cardiac arrest.""

In conclusion, the machine translation is mostly accurate, but it has some differences from the reference translation, particularly in the description of the cause of death. The machine translation could be improved by using the same phrase as the reference translation for ""death from cardiac arrest"" to better convey the meaning.

- The machine translation uses ""颠簸着"" (bumping and banging) while the reference translation uses ""碰碰撞撞"" (bumping and banging). These phrases have similar meanings, but the reference translation is more specific and conveys the intensity of the action.
- The machine translation uses ""一圈又一圈地跑着"" (running around circle after circle) while the reference translation uses ""一圈又一圈地互相激烈竞赛"" (racing each other hard lap after lap). The machine translation does not convey the competitive aspect of the situation as clearly as the reference translation.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It captures the general meaning of the source text but lacks the specificity and intensity of the actions described in the source text. The reference translation provides a clearer and more vivid description of the situation.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, I will first read the source text, then compare the machine translation and reference translation step by step.

Source: Ἑταιρείαι, ""Companionships"") and most frequently employed in the Imperial Guard.

Machine translation: 's' t 's' t 's' ， ""伙伴"") 和最经常受雇于帝国卫队。

Reference translation: Ἑταιρείαι，""伙伴"")和最经常受雇于帝国卫队。

Step 1: Compare the source text and machine translation
The source text is in Greek, and the machine translation is in Chinese. The machine translation seems to have some errors, as it contains non-alphanumeric characters and some words are not correctly translated.

Step 2: Compare the machine translation and reference translation
The reference translation is also in Chinese and appears to be a more accurate translation of the source text. The non-alphanumeric characters are not present in the reference translation, and the words are translated more accurately.

Step 3: Analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation
The machine translation has several issues compared to the reference translation:

1. Non-alphanumeric characters: The machine translation contains non-alphanumeric characters that are not present in the source text or reference translation.
2. Inaccurate word translation: The machine translation does not accurately translate the words from the source text. For example, ""Companionships"" is translated as ""伙伴"" instead of ""伙伴""), and ""most frequently employed"" is translated as ""最经常受雇于"" instead of ""最经常受雇于"".

Conclusion:
The machine translation is of lower quality compared to the reference translation. The non-alphanumeric characters and inaccurate word translation make the machine translation less accurate and harder to understand. The reference translation is more accurate and easier to understand, making it a better translation of the source text.

2. The machine translation uses ""特质通知"" (specie circular) while the reference translation uses ""纸币通告"" (paper currency notice).
3. The machine translation uses ""重新租借该行"" (re-rent the bank) while the reference translation uses ""重新授予银行特许权"" (re-grant the bank's exclusive rights).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The difference in the translation of ""Whigs"" is minor and does not affect the overall meaning.
2. The difference in the translation of ""specie circular"" and ""paper currency notice"" changes the focus of the issue. A ""specie circular"" refers to a government directive regarding the use of precious metal coins, while a ""paper currency notice"" refers to a government directive regarding the use of paper money. This difference in translation can change the understanding of the issue being discussed.
3. The difference in the translation of ""re-rent the bank"" and ""re-grant the bank's exclusive rights"" changes the demand being made by the Whigs. ""Re-rent the bank"" implies that the Whigs want to temporarily use the bank, while ""re-grant the bank's exclusive rights"" implies that the Whigs want the bank to have a permanent monopoly on banking services. This difference in translation can also change the understanding of the Whigs' demand.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not accurate and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The differences in translation can lead to a misunderstanding of the issue being discussed and the demands being made by the Whigs.

Reference translation: 在厄姆博士击败了雷克和雷球之后，胡德和他的帮伙来到了一起，用他的子弹击倒了他。

Differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. The machine translation uses ""帮派"" (gang) while the reference translation uses ""帮伙"" (gang, literally ""help"" in Chinese). Both words can be used to describe a group of people working together, but ""帮伙"" is more commonly used in this context.
2. The machine translation uses ""用他的子弹击倒了他"" (knocked him off balance with his bullets) while the reference translation uses ""用他的子弹击倒了他"" (knocked him off balance with his bullets). Both phrases convey the same meaning, so there is no difference in this part of the sentence.

Overall, the machine translation is of high quality, with only a minor difference in the choice of words. The meaning of the sentence is preserved, and the translation is accurate.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: After a heated fight, Wolverine wounds Mystique, but denies her the Coup de grâce.
Machine translation: 在激烈的战斗之后, 狼伤害了 Mystique, 但否认她的政变.
Reference translation: 在激烈的战斗之后，金刚狼打伤了魔形女，但没有给她致命一击。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 狼伤害了 Mystique, 但否认她的政变.
- Reference translation: 金刚狼打伤了魔形女，但没有给她致命一击。

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- In the machine translation, ""狼伤害了 Mystique"" (Wolverine wounded Mystique) is a direct translation of the source text. However, ""否认她的政变"" (denies her the Coup de grâce) is not an accurate translation of ""denies her the Coup de grâce."" The term ""政变"" (political coup) is not a direct equivalent to ""Coup de grâce"" (a final decisive blow, often fatal).
- In the reference translation, ""金刚狼打伤了魔形女"" (Wolverine wounded Mystique) is a direct translation of the source text. ""但没有给她致命一击"" (but didn't give her a fatal blow) is a more accurate translation of ""denies her the Coup de grâce"" as it captures the idea of a decisive, often fatal blow.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is different from the reference translation in the way it translates the phrase ""denies her the Coup de grâce."" The reference translation provides a more accurate translation that captures the meaning of the original source text. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is lower than that of the reference translation.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, we need to compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify the differences.

Source: Sacrifices to pagan gods, along with paganism itself, were banned after the Baptism of Rus' by Prince Vladimir I in the 980s.

Machine translation: 八十年代 ， 拉基米尔一世亲王给卢斯洗礼后 ， 异教神的圣餐以及异教本身被禁止。

Reference translation: 八十年代，拉基米尔一世亲王给卢斯洗礼后，对异教神的祭祀以及异教本身均被禁止。

Differences:

1. The machine translation uses ""异教神的圣餐"" (pagan gods' feast) while the reference translation uses ""对异教神的祭祀"" (sacrifices to pagan gods). The machine translation is not accurate as it does not convey the meaning of ""sacrifices"" and the reference to ""pagan gods"" is not as clear.

2. The machine translation uses ""异教本身被禁止"" (paganism itself was banned) while the reference translation uses ""异教本身均被禁止"" (both paganism itself and the sacrifices to pagan gods were banned). The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation, as it does not mention the ban on sacrifices to pagan gods.

Overall, the machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning of the source text, while the machine translation has some inaccuracies and lacks clarity in certain parts.

 Step 1: Read the source, machine translation, and reference translation.
Source: His father began as a violinist performing for opera and zarzuela orchestras.
Machine translation: 他父亲最初是为歌剧和 Zarzuela 管弦乐队演奏的小提琴手.
Reference translation: 他的父亲是从小提琴手开始为歌剧和萨祖拉乐团表演的。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- The machine translation uses ""Zarzuela"" while the reference translation uses ""萨祖拉"".
- The machine translation uses ""最初"" while the reference translation uses ""从"".
- The machine translation uses ""管弦乐队"" while the reference translation uses ""乐团"".

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- ""Zarzuela"" is a Spanish term for a theatrical genre, and it is correctly translated as ""萨祖拉"" in the reference translation. The machine translation also correctly translates ""Zarzuela"" as ""Zarzuela"".
- ""最初"" means ""初期"" or ""from the beginning"" in Chinese, and it is a suitable translation for ""begin"" in this context. ""从"" also means ""from"" in Chinese, but it is not as specific as ""最初"". However, the meaning is still conveyed in the reference translation.
- ""管弦乐队"" means ""string orchestra"" in Chinese, and it is a suitable translation for ""orchestras"". ""乐团"" also means ""team"" or ""group"" in Chinese, and it can be understood as ""orchestras"" in this context. The meaning is still conveyed in the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is of high quality, as it accurately conveys the meaning of the source text and is only slightly different from the reference translation. The differences in word choice do not significantly impact the overall meaning of the translation.

Source: In New York City, C. F. Theodor Steinweg anglicized his name to C. F. Theodore Steinway.
Machine translation: 在纽约市 ， C. F. Theodor Steinweg 将自己的名字命名为 C. F. Theodore Steinway 。
Reference translation: 在纽约，C.F.TheodorSteinweg将他的名字英语化，改为C.F.TheodoreSteinway。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.

1. The machine translation uses ""纽约市"" (New York City) while the reference translation uses ""纽约"" (New York).
2. The machine translation uses ""将自己的名字命名为"" (named himself) while the reference translation uses ""将他的名字英语化，改为"" (anglicized his name, changed to).

Step 3: Analyze the differences.

1. The use of ""纽约市"" (New York City) in the machine translation is more specific than ""纽约"" (New York) in the reference translation. However, the source does not specify the city, so the machine translation is not necessarily incorrect.
2. The use of ""将自己的名字命名为"" (named himself) in the machine translation is a slight deviation from the reference translation, which uses ""将他的名字英语化，改为"" (anglicized his name, changed to). The machine translation implies that Theodor Steinweg named himself, while the reference translation implies that he changed his name to an anglicized version. However, both translations convey the same general idea.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.

Overall, the machine translation is of high quality. It conveys the same general idea as the reference translation and only has minor differences in wording. The differences do not significantly impact the understanding of the translation.

Reference translation: 最糟糕的是，这是一部富有旋律的，寓教于乐的肥皂剧。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- 戏剧性的 (melodramatic) vs 富有旋律的 (rich in melody)
- 道德化的 (moralizing) vs 寓教于乐的 (educational yet entertaining)
- 肥皂剧 (soap opera) is the same in both translations.

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- 戏剧性的 (melodramatic) vs 富有旋律的 (rich in melody): The machine translation uses ""melodramatic"" to describe the soap opera, while the reference translation uses ""rich in melody."" Both words convey a sense of exaggeration, but ""melodramatic"" focuses on the emotional aspect, while ""rich in melody"" focuses on the musical aspect.
- 道德化的 (moralizing) vs 寓教于乐的 (educational yet entertaining): The machine translation uses ""moralizing"" to describe the soap opera, while the reference translation uses ""educational yet entertaining."" ""Moralizing"" implies a preachy tone, while ""educational yet entertaining"" suggests that the soap opera is both informative and enjoyable.

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
The machine translation is not entirely accurate in capturing the essence of the source text. While it does convey the idea that the soap opera is overly dramatic and has a moral message, it does not fully capture the musical aspect and the educational yet entertaining nature of the soap opera as described in the reference translation.

Source: They repeated as champions the next year with a pennant and Championship victory over the Brooklyn ""Bridegrooms"".
Machine translation: 他们在第二年以一分钱和锦标赛战胜布鲁克林的 ""新郎"" 而再次成为冠军。
Reference translation: 第二年，他们以因赢得了三角旗和冠军而战胜了布鲁克林的“新郎们”，因而蝉联冠军。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. The machine translation uses ""一分钱"" (a penny) while the reference translation uses ""三角旗"" (pennant).
2. The machine translation uses ""锦标赛"" (silk banner) while the reference translation uses ""冠军"" (championship).
3. The machine translation uses ""布鲁克林的 ""新郎"" 而再次成为冠军"" (victory over the Brooklyn ""Bridegrooms"" and becoming champions again) while the reference translation uses ""因而蝉联冠军"" (therefore, became the National League champions).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of ""一分钱"" (a penny) instead of ""三角旗"" (pennant) is a minor error, as both terms refer to a flag or banner. However, ""三角旗"" is more specific and accurate in this context.
2. The use of ""锦标赛"" (silk banner) instead of ""冠军"" (championship) is a more significant error, as these terms have different meanings. ""锦标赛"" refers to a silk banner, while ""冠军"" refers to the championship title.
3. The machine translation correctly captures the overall meaning of the source text, but the use of ""锦标赛"" and ""一分钱"" instead of ""冠军"" and ""三角旗"" reduces the accuracy and quality of the translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is mostly accurate, but it contains some errors in the choice of specific terms. The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by using more accurate and specific terms.

Reference translation: 这个阁楼有方形的窗户和壁柱，顶端是栏杆，上面有雕刻的奖杯和火焰罐，与平顶相呼应。

Now, let's analyze the differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""枕头"" (pillows) is used instead of ""壁柱"" (pilasters) in the reference translation. This is a significant difference as it changes the meaning of the sentence.
2. In the machine translation, ""阳台"" (balcony) is used instead of ""栏杆"" (balustrade) in the reference translation. This is another significant difference that changes the meaning of the sentence.
3. In the machine translation, ""火锅"" (wok) is used instead of ""火焰罐"" (flame pots) in the reference translation. This is a minor difference, but it still changes the meaning slightly.
4. In the machine translation, ""使一个平顶无法模拟"" (cannot imitate a flat roof) is used instead of ""与平顶相呼应"" (with a flat roof in harmony) in the reference translation. This is a significant difference that changes the overall meaning of the sentence.

Based on these differences, the machine translation is not accurate and does not convey the same meaning as the reference translation. The quality of the English-Chinese translation is poor.

Source: The Virgin sits on a throne without a back, her feet resting on a pedestal, embellished with precious stones.
Machine translation: 维珍坐在王位上 ， 没有背部 ， 脚踏在台阶上 ， 镶嵌着宝石。
Reference translation: 圣母坐在没有后背的王座上，脚踏在基座上，上面镶嵌着宝石。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation uses ""维珍"" (Virgin) while the reference translation uses ""圣母"" (Holy Mother).
- Machine translation uses ""王位"" (throne) while the reference translation uses ""王座"" (throne).
- Machine translation uses ""台阶"" (steps) while the reference translation uses ""基座"" (pedestal).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
- The difference in the name of the Virgin is not significant, as both refer to the same person.
- The difference between ""throne"" and ""throne"" is also not significant, as both words refer to the same object.
- The difference between ""steps"" and ""pedestal"" is more significant. In the source, the Virgin's feet are resting on a pedestal, while in the machine translation, her feet are resting on steps. This difference changes the meaning slightly, as a pedestal is a separate object that supports the throne, while steps are part of the throne itself.

Step 4: Conclusion
The machine translation is mostly accurate, but there is a slight difference in meaning due to the translation of ""pedestal"" as ""steps."" The overall quality of the machine translation is good, but it could be improved by ensuring that the correct terms are used to maintain the original meaning.

Reference translation: 赖特称他们为“绝对”而非“原则”。

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 赖特把它们称为绝对原则而不是原则。
- Reference translation: 赖特称他们为“绝对”而非“原则”。

Differences:
1. The machine translation uses 把它们称为 (call them) while the reference translation uses 称他们为 (call them).
2. The machine translation uses 绝对原则 (absolute principles) while the reference translation uses 绝对 (absolute) and 原则 (principles).
3. The machine translation uses 而不是 (rather than) while the reference translation uses 而非 (instead of).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and determine the quality of the machine translation.
1. The use of 把它们称为 (call them) in the machine translation is less accurate than 称他们为 (call them) in the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning of ""dubbed"" in the source.
2. The machine translation combines 绝对 and 原则 into 绝对原则, which is less accurate than the reference translation's separation of 绝对 and 原则.
3. The use of 而不是 (rather than) in the machine translation is less accurate than 而非 (instead of) in the reference translation. The reference translation better captures the meaning of ""than"" in the source.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
- Machine translation: 试图把军队分成两半 ， 包围中国人。
- Reference translation: 一分为二来包围他们。

Step 3: Analyze the differences.
- In the machine translation, it says ""试图把军队分成两半"" (trying to split the army into two), while the reference translation says ""一分为二来包围"" (split into two to encircle).
- In the machine translation, it says ""包围中国人"" (encircle the Chinese), while the reference translation says ""他们"" (them, referring to the Chinese army).

Step 4: Evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
- The machine translation captures the general meaning of the source text, but it is not as accurate as the reference translation.
- The machine translation omits the information about the Burmese trying to encircle the Chinese army specifically, which is present in the reference translation.
- The machine translation also uses a more general term ""中国人"" (Chinese) instead of the more specific term ""中国军队"" (Chinese army) used in the reference translation.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation. It captures the general meaning but omits some important details and uses a less specific term.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, we need to compare the machine translation with the reference translation and identify any differences.

Source: He marched toward the port city of Mocha, killing 14,000 and capturing 11,000.
Machine translation: 他向港口城市 Mocha 行进 ， 打死 14 000 人 ， 抓获 11 000 人。
Reference translation: 他向港口城市摩卡（Mocha）前进，杀死了1万4千人，并俘获了1万1千人。

Differences between the machine translation and reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""Mocha"" is written in English, while in the reference translation, it is written in Chinese as ""摩卡"" and enclosed in parentheses. This difference does not affect the overall meaning, but it does show a slight discrepancy in the way the name is presented.

2. In the machine translation, the verbs ""打死"" (kill) and ""抓获"" (capture) are used, while in the reference translation, the verbs ""杀死了"" (killed) and ""俘获了"" (captured) are used. The machine translation uses simpler verbs, while the reference translation uses more formal and specific verbs. This difference does not significantly impact the meaning, but it does show a slight variation in the choice of words.

3. The machine translation uses the number ""14 000"" and ""11 000"" directly, while the reference translation uses the Chinese way of writing numbers ""1万4千"" and ""1万1千."" This difference is mainly in the presentation of numbers and does not affect the overall meaning.

Overall, the machine translation is quite accurate and conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. However, there are some minor differences in the presentation of the name ""Mocha,"" the choice of verbs, and the way numbers are written. These differences do not significantly impact the overall quality of the translation, but they do show a slight discrepancy between the two translations.

1. Source: involuntary intoxication
Machine translation: 非自愿中毒
Reference translation: 无意识的中毒
Difference: The machine translation uses ""非自愿"" (non-voluntary) while the reference translation uses ""无意识"" (unconscious or involuntary). The reference translation better captures the meaning of ""involuntary"" as it implies a lack of conscious control.

2. Source: intoxication leading to mental illness
Machine translation: 导致精神疾病的中毒
Reference translation: 中毒导致的精神疾病
Difference: Both translations are the same, accurately conveying the meaning of ""intoxication leading to mental illness.""

3. Source: actio libera in causa
Machine translation: 因果关系中的自由行动
Reference translation: 因果自由行动
Difference: The machine translation adds ""关系中的"" (in the relationship) to the phrase, which is not present in the source or reference translation. This addition changes the meaning of the phrase, making it less accurate.

4. Source: voluntary intoxication
Machine translation: 以及自愿中毒
Reference translation: 自愿中毒
Difference: The machine translation adds ""以及"" (and) at the beginning of the phrase, which is not present in the source or reference translation. This addition is unnecessary and changes the meaning of the phrase.

Overall, the machine translation has some inaccuracies and deviations from the reference translation. The differences in translating ""involuntary intoxication"" and ""actio libera in causa"" are particularly problematic, as they change the meaning of the original source. The machine translation is not as accurate as the reference translation, and therefore, the quality of the English-Chinese translation is not as high as it could be.

Step 2: Identify the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation.
1. The machine translation uses ""音乐描述"" (music description) while the reference translation uses ""LP描述"" (LP description).
2. The machine translation uses ""音乐美德的表现"" (display of musical virtues) while the reference translation uses ""音乐技巧的展示"" (display of musical virtuosity).
3. The machine translation uses ""任何摇滚乐家从未超越过的"" (never surpassed by any rock musician) while the reference translation uses ""任何摇滚音乐家都无法超越的"" (unsurpassable by any rock musician).

Step 3: Analyze the differences and evaluate the quality of the machine translation.
1. The difference in ""音乐描述"" (music description) and ""LP描述"" (LP description) is minor and does not significantly impact the overall meaning.
2. The difference in ""音乐美德的表现"" (display of musical virtues) and ""音乐技巧的展示"" (display of musical virtuosity) is more significant. While both phrases convey a similar idea, ""音乐技巧的展示"" (display of musical virtuosity) more accurately captures the essence of the original source, which emphasizes the exceptional skill and talent of the musician.
3. The difference in ""任何摇滚乐家从未超越过的"" (never surpassed by any rock musician) and ""任何摇滚音乐家都无法超越的"" (unsurpassable by any rock musician) is also significant. The machine translation implies that no rock musician has been able to surpass the LP, while the reference translation emphasizes that it is unsurpassable, suggesting that it is a benchmark that no rock musician can reach.

Conclusion: The machine translation is not a perfect match for the reference translation, and there are some differences in the choice of words and phrasing. However, the overall meaning is still conveyed, and the machine translation is generally accurate. The quality of the machine translation can be considered as good, but there is room for improvement in capturing the nuances of the original source.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.

 To evaluate the quality of the English-Chinese translation, I will first read the source, machine translation, and reference translation. Then, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation to determine the quality of the machine translation.

Source: Afterwards, the team battles Omega Red again, and teammate and telepath Psylocke tries to lure Cyclops into an affair behind Jean's back.

Machine translation: 后来 ， 球队又与奥米加红队进行了战斗 ， 队友和心灵感应的 Psylock ke 试图引诱赛克雷普斯在让的背后发生事情。

Reference translation: 后来，团队又与红色欧米茄进行了战斗，队友兼心灵感应者灵蝶试图背着琴引诱独眼龙发生关系。

Now, I will analyze the differences between the machine translation and the reference translation:

1. In the machine translation, ""Omega Red"" is translated as ""奥米加红队,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""红色欧米茄."" The reference translation is more accurate, as ""Omega Red"" is a character in the X-Men comics, and the name should be kept in its original form.

2. In the machine translation, ""Psylocke"" is translated as ""Psylock ke,"" which is incorrect. The reference translation correctly translates it as ""灵蝶.""

3. In the machine translation, ""Cyclops"" is translated as ""赛克雷普斯,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""独眼龙."" The reference translation is more accurate, as ""Cyclops"" is a character in the X-Men comics, and the name should be kept in its original form.

4. In the machine translation, ""Jean's back"" is translated as ""让的背后,"" while in the reference translation, it is translated as ""琴的背后."" The reference translation is more accurate, as ""Jean"" is a character in the X-Men comics, and the name should be kept in its original form.

Based on the analysis, the machine translation has several inaccuracies compared to the reference translation. The machine translation does not accurately translate the names of the characters and does not maintain the original form of the names. Therefore, the quality of the machine translation is not as good as the reference translation.
Based on above analysis, score the machine translation quality on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means ""no meaning preserved"" and score of one hundred means ""perfect meaning and grammar"". Provide the score strictly in JSON format.
