'<s>[INST]Score the following translation from Romanian to English with respect to the human reference on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means "no meaning preserved" and score of one hundred means "perfect meaning and grammar". \nRomanian source: adîncă pecete pe sufletul viitorului poet, iar opera lui o va mărturisi cu vădită\nEnglish human reference: deep seals on the soul of the future poet , and his work will clearly testify to it\n\nEnglish translation: hallmark the soul of the future poet and his work will confess him clearly.\nScore: [/INST]'	' I would score the provided English translation a score of around 70 out of 100. While the English version conveys the general meaning. of the original Romanian text, some aspects of grammar and wording could be improved.\n\nIn the original text, the verb "adîncă" is translated as "hallmark" in the English version, but a more appropriate translation might be "seal/imprint on" to preserve the meaning of the original word. Additionally, the verb form of "confess/mărturisi" is changed to "confess him clearly" in the English version, but it would be more accurate to use a passive voice and say "he will be clearly testified to by his work" or simply "his work will clearly testify to him/it (i.e. the future poet\'s abilities or qualities)."\n\nThe overall meaning of the text is still present in the English version, but the specific word choices and grammatical structures used do not fully preserve the precise meaning and nuances of the original text. Therefore, a more accurate and polished English rendering of the original text might be:\n\n"[Let there be] a deep seal/imprint on the soul of the future poet, and his work will clearly testify to it/him/them (i.e. the poet\'s abilities or qualities)."

While the main idea is conveyed. The grammar is mostly correct, the word choice of "when the ash was transferred to Émile Zola in Panthéon" is not entirely accurate. A better alternative would be "on the occasion of the transfer of the ashes of Émile Zola to the Pantheon, "as in the reference provided. Therefore, a 60, as the meaning is mostly preserved but there is room for improvement in terms of nuance and adherence to the source text.'

The word "of" in the reference is a possessive indicating belonging or close association between "all Slovaciei" and "brigăzi de infanterie mecanizate".\n\nHowever, the meaning and grammatical structure of the English Translation is otherwise essentially identical to the reference, conveying the same idea clearly and accurately. Hence, I assigned a near-perfect score of 95.'

The source and target sentences convey entirely different concepts. The original text discussed a historical event about a British airborne division, while the English translation discusses a bank rest restoring its long-term viability, which is not related to the original text. Thus, the meaning was not preserved, leading to a very low or even zero score.'

Therefore, although the overall meaning of the original text is conveyed, some important details related to the description of the painting and the medium used are missing.'

However, the wording of the English sentence is not quite idiomatic or natural, which slightly detracts from its overall meaning. A more idiomatic and clear English version might be: "Jewish businesspeople were also involved in these financial dealings/shenanigans/situations/etc."\n\nExplanation for (partial) deduction:\n\n- The phrase "Jewish businesses were also mix[ed]" is not a common or idiomatic expression in English, and it is not clear what exactly the word "mix[ed]" is supposed to convey. A more precise and clearer word to use would be "involved" or "participated in" in this particular context.\n- Moreover, the wording "in these financial combinations" may not be the best way to convey the meaning of the original text, especially since the concept of "combinatii financiare" (literally, "financial combinations") in the original source is not a standard concept in English. A more precise and clear phrasing of the original meaning might be: "J godişi erau implicaţi si afacerişti evrei".\n\nOverall, the provided English sentence partially reflects the meaning of the original sentence, but it is not quite precise or clear. Therefore, a final grade of 50 seems appropriate.'

While the general meaning of the sentence is preserved. i.e. that millions of blocks were finished and raised. The word used in the original sentence is "spinare," which means "back" in the context of carrying something on one\'s back, not "spined" as in the provided English version. Additionally, the word "stone" is not explicitly present in the original sentence, and the phrase "for the construction of the top/upper part" could be rendered more idiomatically as "as part of the upper section/structure/portion of a building or object". Therefore, the grammar and phrasing of the English version could be improved. However, the main ideas conveyed in the sentence, such as the scale of the project and the physical effort involved, are still apparent.'

The use of "As opposed to 1938" captures the meaning of "față de anul 1938" in the original text, and the phrases "support among officers for force action" and "dramatically decline" match the meaning of "sprijinul în rândurile ofițerilor pentru o acțiune în forță" and "scăzuse în mod dramatic" respectively.\n\nTherefore, the score for this task is 100.'

The term "IA" in the English translation could be replaced with "artificial intelligence" to improve fluency and increase the score. Additionally, the word "trying" in the English version could be interpreted as carrying a stronger sense of intent or progress than the original text implies, but this is a minor issue that does not significantly obscure the meaning. Overall, the English version effectively conveys the idea that many researchers in the field of artificial intelligence are distancing themselves from military applications.'

The English translation conveys the same overall meaning as the original text, but there are some errors and inaccuracies in the grammar and word choice. The word "episcopi" is correctly translated as "bishops," but the term "susținători ai Bourbonilor" is translated as "supporters of Bourbonies" instead of "supporters of the Bourbons" or "Bourbon supporters." Additionally, the word "plecat" is correctly translated as "have gone to exile" but "in exil" should be "into exile" or simply "into exile."\n\nTaking these errors and inaccuracies into account, I would give this a 70/100 for preserving the meaning of the original, but with room for improvement in the grammatical and linguistic aspects of the English version.'

In the source text, "antidreyfusarzii" refers to individuals who opposed the rehabilitation of French army captain Alfred Dreyfus, who was falsely accused of treason in the late 19th century.\n\nHowever, the English translation contains some errors in grammar and wording that slightly obscure the meaning. For example, "rehabilitation" is an awkward fit in the context of the original, as it refers to a process of restoring one\'s reputation or rights, not necessarily a physical healing process. A better term might be "rehabilitation effort" or "rehabilitation move" to indicate the political and social significance of the action in the context of the text.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase "which they considered to be a hasty and surreptitious" is somewhat ambiguous and stilted. A more straightforward phrasing might be "which they believed was premature and secretive," to convey the meaning of the original without awkwardly constructed phraseology.\n\nOverall, the English translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original, but some awkward word choices and grammatical errors prevent it from receiving a top score.'

Additionally, "in 1603" in the original sentence is inaccurately represented as "since 1603" in the English sentence, implying that the appearance of the flag occurred over a period of time, rather than at a specific point in time.

Specifically, the phrase "the function of life" should be "the office of First Minister" to be consistent with the original meaning. Additionally, the verb tense of "have started to increase" is inappropriate as it implies a continuous action that is still happening, whereas the original implies completed actions in the past. A better verb tense to use is "began to increase" or simply "grew."

While the English translation conveys the same basic meaning as the original text, some of the grammar and syntax is incorrect, leading to a less-than-perfect score.\n\nIn particular. the English sentence features a few errors that make it sound unnatural and confusing. For example, the phrase "The base of ovar" is not correct English - it should be "the base of the ovary" or simply "the ovarian base" for clarity. Additionally, the term "an intrastaminal nectarifer" is not a common English term and is not easily understood in this context. Finally, the lack of articles in the English sentence ("a" or "the" before "disc" and "subovarian") further contributes to the confusion and ungrammaticality of the sentence.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that translation is a difficult and complex task, and even the best translators may make occasional errors or omissions. In this case, the meaning of the original sentence is still largely preserved in the English version, but some details may have been lost or distorted in the process.\n\nTo improve the English sentence, I would suggest the following:\n\n"The ovarian base contains a nectar-secreting disc located in the intrastaminal, subovarian region."\n\nThis version is more grammatical and precise, while still conveying the same meaning as the original. However, it is always important to remember that translation involves a careful consideration of the specific context, register, and purpose of the text, and may require different approaches depending on the situation.'

Secondly, the term "penitenciarii" in the source text refers specifically to prisons, penal institutions or correctional facilities, and cannot be rendered as the generic "the prison " in the English language.

The word "department" is incorrect in this context, as it refers to a distinct aspect or feature of something, often a subject of attention, such as a department of a larger entity.\n2. The word "pandantive" refers to something that serves as a substitute, an accessory, or a decorative element, typically of a pendant variety.\n\nIn the English text, the meaning of "pandantive" is retained, but the use of the word "depth" is not quite appropriate. In this case, the reference to the "detail or aspect of "pandantive" with "chains braided from fine gold wire" should be conveyed with words that convey the idea of the "aspect or detail " in question.\n\nA more accurate and precise English version of the text, therefore, would be "a crucial detail is that of pandantives with braided chains of fine-gold wire" or "an important detail is the one regarding pandantives with braided chains of fine-gold wire" with a grammar and phrasing consistent with English standards.

The word "forţele" in the source means "forces" or "troops" and is used in the context of the Austrian and Russian militaries. The word "austriace" is the possessive of "Austria" and is used in the context of the Austrian military. The word "ruseşti" is the possessive of "Russian" and is used in the context of the Russian military.

"La sfârşitul puterilor" is more idiomatic, and "at the end of his abilities/strengths/means" is the most likely meaning in this context.\n- "departe" usually means "far" or "far away" and "departe de" usually implies "away from", so including "departe" with "de la familia lui" is redundant.\n\nOverall, the English text conveys the meaning of the original, but some details of the wording could be improved to more closely reflect the original language.

However, the word "starting" used in the English version is not quite accurate; a more accurate rendering of the meaning of the original would be "marking" or "designating" (as used in the reference text provided by the human evaluator for this task). Additionally, "hard sectors" might refer to particularly robust or rugged data storage mechanisms (a possibility suggested, for example, by the original use of "sectori" in the singular in the source sentence, with its connotation of distinct, countable entities, and the word "hard" preceding it in the English target sentence, suggesting a particular type of entity or feature of the disks in question). "Hard disks" is a clear improvement, but it still slightly obscures the meaning of the sentence. Overall, the grammatical structure of the sentence is correct, but the specific rendering of the meaning of the original slightly marrs the overall fluency of the sentence.'

While the general meaning of the original statement is preserved in the English translation. The use of "Russian citizens" in the English version rather than "Russians" in the original is slightly inaccurate and could lead to confusion. The distinction is important because "Russians" refers to the people while "Russian citizens" refer to those who are legally recognized as part of the state, and thus the two terms are not inter-exchangeable. Therefore, the accuracy of the preservated meaning of the original statement is affected. Nevertheless, the overall meaning of the original was not altered to the point of obscurity, and the reader can still understand the main idea presented.'

The phrase "ceea ce a dus" in the original sentence is translated as "which led to," but a more idiomatic English translation might be "ultimately leading to." This is because the word "ceea ce a dus" in the original sentence implies that the acceptance of the offer directly resulted in the subsequent event, and the word "another" in the English reference might not carry this same connotation. Therefore, a more precise but less literal word-for-word English equivalent might be "Alexei accepted the offer, leading straight to another event/situation/outcome/etc." However, the provided English translation conveys the overall meaning of the sentence, and the grammatical structure is correct, so I would rate it 80/100.'

While the general meaning of the sentence is preserved. there are some errors and oddities in the English translation that slightly muddle the message.\n\nFor one, the name "Lazarus" is spelled differently in the original and translated sentences. The use of "Lazome" in the English version is likely a result of a misunderstanding of the original name, as it looks suspiciously similar to the English word "home" with a "z" added to the beginning.\n\nSecond, the phrase "construit și extins" is translated to "built and enlarged," which is generally accurate, but could be more smoothly translated to simply "expanded."\n\nFinally, the word " Astăzi " is translated to "today already full," which makes little sense in English. A more appropriate rendering might be "is now already fully occupied" or simply "is now full," depending on the intended meaning.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I would estimate the preservation of meaning in the given English sentence to be about 70-75% compared to the original. While the core concept of a building or structure being built and then expanded. and eventually becoming full, is conveyed, the specific phrasing and word choices used in the English sentence could be improved.'

Therefore, the given English sentence lacks some accuracy and meaning compared to the original and reference sentences, and thus, it earns a low-to-middling translation quality assessment.'

While the English sentence conveys the same rough idea as the original sentence inRomanian, there are some significant differences in wording and grammar that result in a less accurate and somewhat confusing English sentence.\n\nFor one, the word "stalemate" is not an appropriate substitute for "declansarea razboiului", which means "outbreak of the war" inRomanian. A "stalemate" refers to a situation in which no progress can be made or no side has an advantage, typically in the context of a competition or conflict. In this case, the correct word to use is "outbreak" or "declaration of war" to convey the original meaning.\n\nAdditionally, the verb tense in the original sentence is past perfect, indicating that the action of capturing occurred after the start of the war. However, the English sentence is in the past tense, which does not convey the same meaning.\n\nFinally, the word "trap" is not a good substitute for "erau prinse" in this case, as it implies that the systems actively ensnared the mechanisms, whereas the original sentence suggests that the systems simply took hold of the mechanisms.\n\nOverall, the provided English sentence is not an accurate or coherent rendering of the original, and would likely confuse a native English reader. Therefore, I would rate the quality of the English sentence as quite low.'

Also, "vessels" might be more appropriate than "navelors japonxeze" (Japanese ships).

The term "forța de muncă multilingvă" in the original has been translated as "multilingual workforce" in the reference, but a more accurate rendering could be "a multilingual labor force" or "a multilingual working population". Also, the verb "concuraă" in the original is translated as "is praising itself" in the reference, but the original text actually implies a more positive connotation, along the lines of "promotes" or "highlights proudly/showcases" (the verb "laudă" is used in the original text in the form of "se laudă", meaning "boasts of/about"). Furthermore, the use of the word "recently" in the reference is not explicitly present in the original, and it might be an assumption made based on the current political/economic context of the countries involved.

While the English version conveys the basic idea. of the original title, there are several errors and inaccuracies that significantly detract from the meaning and grammatical correctness of the text.\n\nFirstly, the name of the publisher has been mistranslated. "Editura Științifică și Enciclopedică" should be "Scientific and Encyclopedic Publishing House" in English, not "Scientific Editorial and Enclopaedic."\n\nSecond, the word "blanc" in the English version is a mistranslation of "balcanice" in the original. "Balcanice" refers to the geographical and cultural region of the Balkans, not the color "blanc/white/empty/bLANK."\n\nFinally, the word "substratul" in the original is missing an apostrophe and should be "the substratum" in English, not "substratum."\n\nOverall, the English version conveys the idea of the original, but the numerous errors and inconsistencies make it challenging to read and understand. Therefore, I would rate the English translation a 30/100 for meaning and grammatical correctness.'

While the English translation includes some words.asdthat are similar in meaning to the original Romanian text, the overall meaning has been lost in the translation. The words "burghezimea mică și mijlocie" in the original text refer to the small and middle bourgeoisie, but the English translation renders this as "the small and medium-sized" and "shore" - which have no relation to the intended meaning. Additionally, the word "țărănime" refers to the peasantry, but this was lost in the English translation. Overall, the grammatical structure of the English sentence is also incorrect. Therefore, the meaning of the original text was not preserved in this English translation, and it would be difficult to understand the intended meaning without referring to the original text.'

The Romanian source text appears. to be attempting to convey the idea of a bust of the Roman emperor Trajan located at the Louvre Museum. The English translation captures this basic meaning, but it contains some errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall clarity and accuracy of the message. For example, the translated text renders "la" as "al" and includes the extraneous and possibly confusing parentheses surrounding "Traian." Additionally, the capitalization and spacing are inconsistent, and the word "Tumbleft185px" appears to be a typo or code that should not be present in the text. Improving these aspects of the translation would likely result in a closer approximation of the original text and a higher score. Nonetheless, the central idea of the source text is still discernable in the English version, so I have given it a modest score of 60.'

"Mii" (thousands) is written in lowercase in the original and in uppercase in the English version.\n2. "au fost omorâți" (were killed) is in the passive voice in the original, and in the active in the English version.\n3.

The translation captures some elements of the original meaning, such as the presence of "four windows" and a sense of something being "fitted." However, the use of "cross section cross section check" is unclear and does not convey the intended meaning of "octagonal tower pierced by" in a meaningful way. The inaccuracies in the English translation result in loss of meaning and a confused understanding of the original phrase.\n\nA more accurate English version of the provided Romanian phrase is: "fitted with an octagonal turret featuring four windows piercings/openings/holes/gaps/etc."\n\nIt is worth noting that the word "prevăzut" in the original text is somewhat ambiguous and may refer to something being "fitted/equipped/supplied with" as well as "provided/endowed/gifted with/etc." I opted for the first meaning in this case, but the word can be interpreted differently depending on the context.'

However, there is room for improvement as the grammar and sentence structure can be refined further. For example, "According to information from Germany, the aid was granted in the form of a lease for infrastructure use" could be more naturally phrased as "Germany provided information that the aid was granted in the form of a lease for the use of infrastructure." Additionally, the passive voice slightly obscures the subject of the sentence, and it might be clearer to use active voice.

The term "adunare de la nivelul parohiilor sau breslelor lor" is translated as "the assembly at the level of their house or church" but a more accurate rendering could be "the assembly of their parish or guild council" to preserve the meaning of "bresle" closer to its social and political meaning. Additionally, the phrase "dacă au plătit impozitele" is left untranslated in the English reference, so I assume it was not included in the original source. The overall meaning of the text is still clear and easily understood, which is the most important aspect of a good translation.

The word "bombardment" in the English translation conveys a similar meaning to "bombing" in the reference, but "bombardment" often implies a continuous, persistent, or heavy use of explosives, while "bombing" has a broader meaning and can be used for singular or sporadic uses of explosives. However, in this particular context, it is clear that the meaning of the text is preserved, and the use of "bombardment" in the English version is acceptable. Thus, I would score the provided English translation a 90, as the meaning is largely preserved, and the small difference in connotation of the word "bombardment" does not significantly alter the overall meaning of the text.'

Additionally, the phrase "It can be seen how" may not accurately reflect the nuance of "Se vede cum se rescrie" in the original, and could be better expressed as "One can see how it is rewritten" or "It is clear/obvious how it is rewritten" to more closely preserve the meaning and tone of the original.\n\nOverall, the grammar and syntax of the English sentence are correct, but the specific wording chosen slightly obscures the meaning of the original, leading to a slight loss of fidelity.'

Additionally, the word "dealt with" in the English version could be interpreted differently, potentially leading to a slight loss in meaning precision.

However, in English, the continuous form "to launching" is not commonly used in this context, and a simple infinitive form is more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the correct English sentence should be: "HMS Furious to launch torpedoes against the enemy fleet."\n\nThe article "the" is also missing in the English sentence, but it is not crucial to the meaning and thus does not impact the overall accuracy of the sentence.\n\nTaking these factors into consideration, I would rate the given English sentence 85 points out of 100, as the meaning is mostly preserved, and the errors are minor and do not impact the overall understanding of the sentence.'

The phrase "coming from the new world" is dangling at the beginning of the sentence, creating confusion as to who or what is coming from the new world.\n\n2. The verb tense used in the clause "who, coming from the new world" is also inconsistent with the rest of the sentence, which is in the past tense.\n\n3. The word "seafarers" is not a direct equivalent to "navigators" and is less commonly used, leading to a slightly awkward rendering.\n\n4. The phrase "watched Picos what was the first thing to be seen from Europe" is clumsy and ungrammatical, with an incorrect word order and an unclear antecedent for "what was the first thing to be seen from Europe."\n\nA more accurate and clear English rendering of the sentence might be:\n\n"This name originated from the navigators of old, who, upon coming from the new world, saw the Picos as the first thing visible from Europe."\n\nWith a revised sentence, the meaning and grammaticality of the English is greatly improved, and the antecedent for "the first thing visible from Europe" is clarified.

Additionally, the verb tense in the English slightly changes the meaning, as "have continued the attack" may imply that the attack was interrupted and started again, while the original tense of the verb in the source implies the attack continued uninterrupted. Overall, it is clear that the subject of the sentence remains bombers coming from the east, but the precise meaning and grammatical correctness of the target is somewhat lacking in comparison to the reference.'

Omitting this modifier results in a less specific meaning in the English translation, as "Romanian" might be interpreted as referring either to the country or the language. A more accurate translation would be "The history of Romanian-language education in Transylvania up to 1800, Bucharest 1944."\n\nFurthermore, "până" means "until" or "up to," but it should be paired with a specific point in time, not a location, so "until 1800" in the reference is preferable to "to 1800" in the English text.\n\nOverall, while the main ideas of the original text come across in the English version, the lack of specificity and minor errors detract slightly from the quality of the translation.'

Finally, the original term "Ju 87 dive bombers" is mangled in the English translation to "aircraft drowning bombardment Ju 87".

First, the word "vessels" in the English text might not be the best choice to convey the meaning of "vase" in the original, as "vessel" usually refers to a container, and not a ship. However, the meaning of the English sentence remains clear, and it is likely that the term "vessel" was used intentionally to refer to the "ships" implied in the original.\n\nSecond, the word "muniție" in the original has been translated as "ammunition" in the English, but a more precise equivalent might be "supplies" or "war materiel", as the original word refers to any type of supplies or goods used for military purposes, and not just ammunition specifically. However, the word "ammunition" is not incorrect, as it conveys the idea of military equipment being supplied.\n\nFinally, the word "praf" in the original text, meaning "powder" or "dust" in the sense of a fine, loose substance, is not directly translated in the English, but is instead conveyed by the more specific "shot powder" or "black powder", a form of propellant used in firearms.\n\nOverall, I believe the given English translation is very accurate, and that it fully conveys the meaning of the original text, with no significant errors or discrepancies.

While the general meaning of the sentence is preserved, there are several errors in the English translation that detract from its accuracy and fluency.\n\nOne of the most significant errors is the mistranslation of "portul" (which means "port" in Romanian) as "the popular port" in English. It is not clear from the context what a "popular port" would mean, and it seems that the word "portul" should have been translated as "port" or "harbor" in this context, referring to a protected bay or cove where ships can seek refuge.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase "a evoluat mult" (which means "has evolved a lot" inRomanian) is translated awkwardly as "has evolved a great deal through the use of" in English. A more appropriate English phrasing might be "has undergene significant development through the use of embroidery, ornaments, and floral motifs."\n\nFinally, the word "brochures" is used erroneously in the English sentence instead of "embroideries" or "embellishments" as in the original.\n\nOverall, the meaning of the sentence is still discernable, but the numerous errors make it challenging to understand and somewhat distract from the intended meaning. Hence, a relatively low score of 30 is assigned to the provided English version.'

While the high-level meaning of the sentence is preserved. there are inaccuracies in the translation that affect its fluency and naturalness.\n\nOne issue is the translation of "prima oară" as "for the first time in" which sounds clunky and unidiomatic. A more idiomatic translation could be "making its debut/premiere".\n\nA more significant issue is the mistranslation of "stârnește atât dezgust cât și admirație sinceră în rândul criticilor" as "arouses both disgust and sincere admiration among the critics". A piece of art might elicit a complex range of reactions from the critics, but it is unlikely that a play\'s first performance in a theatre will generate outright disgust. A more likely interpretation of the original is that the performance elicited a complex emotional response, including admiration.\n\nFinally, the word "disguise" in the English translation is incorrect, and it is not related to the intended meaning of the source sentence.\n\nOverall, the provided English sentence conveys the source\'s meaning but contains errors and awkward wording, leading to a reduced fluency and clarity. Therefore, I would rate the quality of the provided English sentence as a 60 compared to the original.'

Additionally, the words "monies" and "fine" are not appropriate translations for the original words, and the phrase "like an excise duty" is a poor substitute for the intended meaning of "ca „obiecte” artistice."

However, the word "Aliați" in the original text means "Allies" in English. In this case, the scorer might not be familiar with the specific meaning of "Aliați" in this historical context, so it would be reasonable to assume that the error is due to lack of knowledge of the correct word rather than mistranslation. The word "Aliancea de la Moscova" in the provided translation is understandable but not quite right; the more appropriate English phrase is "the Alliance of Moscow" or simply "Moscow Alliance" rather than "the Alliance of Moscow." The correct date is also given as October 28, not October 29.\n\nMore importantly, the word "armistițiu" in the original language should be "armistice" in English. The provided answer contains a non-English word "armistițium" that does not convey any meaning in English.

The English translation, however, renders this as "an iron and cobalt compound", which could be interpreted as separate substances of iron and cobalt combined with the preposition "and" or a mixture of iron and cobalt.\n\nThese differences result in a less precise and slightly altered meaning compared to the original sentence, which is reflected in the moderate loss of meaning in the English version.

In the English version, the word "Major Henry " is placed after "to take action," making it seem as though "Major Henry" is the one taking action upon someone or something.\n\nHowever, if we consider a more literal interpretation of the source sentence, the wording of the English version is more accurately "At this point, (s)he chose the Major for action (entrance in action)."\n\nA better but slightly different option for the English version, conveying the intended meaning with some word changes, would be: "This is the moment that the decision to let Major Henry act was taken." A more general, natural wording that still conveys the same meaning and flow in the English language is: "Major Henry chose to take action at that moment."'

In Romanian, "realizare" (realizare) is not a direct equivalent of "achievement"; it is closer in meaning to "realization" or "completion".

In the original text, the subject of the sentence is "Rezultatul" which means "The result", but the actual subject of the sentence is "creşterea" which means "the increase in demand for". Therefore, the English sentence is more clear and precise if it starts with "The result was an increase in the demand for gold and silver..."\n\nAnother minor issue is the repetition of the word "which" at the beginning of the second clause. In the original text, the word "care" is used only once, and it refers to "băncile" (banks).

Additionally, the use of "the euthanasia programme" in the reference sentence could imply a specific and already established program, whereas the given English translation lacks the definite article, which could imply a more general meaning.

The word "harsassment" is more aggressive and less nuanced in meaning. Therefore, I would suggest a different word in the English sentence, for example, "In june, Vlad adopted a tactic of continous pursuit, eagerly awaiting the promised aid from Hungary."\n\nMoreover, the word "tactical" might not fit the original meaning, in the sense that "tactics" are deliberate, thought-through maneuvres, which is not evident in the original.

Additionally, using "given orders" could improve the flow, implying a pursuit or movement due to official instructions.\n\nHere\'s an improved English version, but the minor adjustments should not significantly alter the meaning compared to the reference and not significantly increase the fluency of the text:\n\nA counter-investigation targets Picquart, being relocated eastward in France and subsequently to Tunisia on assignment.\n\nNevertheless, the provided text is mostly understandable, and the overall meaning is preserved, so I still assign a relatively strong evaluation of 85.

While some elements of the original meaning are somewhat conveyed in the English version, the grammar and vocabulary used in the English version result in a significantly distorted and unclear meaning, with multiple words in the English version not making sense in this context. The grammatical structure and word choices make it challenging for a native English speaker to understand the intended meaning. Additionally, the use of the word "porecres" and "whistle-blowers" is confusing as it has no direct equivalent in English and the meaning intended in the original text is not clear.

The word "gazedii" in this context specifically refers to the heinous practice of gassing people, primarily Jews, carried out by the Nazis in their concentration and extermination camps during the Holocaust. Therefore, a more accurate and respectable English translation of the sentence should read:\n\n"In Auschwitz, up to 6,000 people were gassed every day until the spring of 1944."\n\nThis way, the meaning of the sentence is preserved, and the seriousness of the matter is better conveyed. The grammatical errors in the original English sentence, such as the lack of articles and the incorrect verb tense, also contribute to the low quality of the initial English version.

Additionally, the lack of a preposition such as "in" or "on" between "previously" and "supported" further contributes to the unnaturalness of the English sentence. Overall, the grammatical structures and word choices in the English version do not convey the intended meaning as clearly or naturally as the original Romanian sentence.'

Specifically, the phrase "superpower rival" in the English translation is not grammatically correct, as it should be expressed as either "superpower rivalry" or "superpower rivals." Additionally, the verb tense in "which has lasted the next 46 years" is slightly awkward, as the use of "which" already implies a past time frame, making the use of "the next" unnecessary. A more accurate and appropriately tense-adjusted English version might read: "The Soviet Union and the United States became rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War, which lasted for the subsequent 46 years."

Also, the word "beyond" is not quite right in the English version as the original conveys the idea of "after" and not extending further.

Instead of "would soon cease" (which is more future-forward, suggesting an inevitability to the ceasing of resistance that may not be intended in the original sentence, but which is still a plausible interpretation of the given context), the English version uses "was soon to stop" (which is more nuanced and less inevitable-sounding, but still conveys the overall meaning of the original sentence quite accurately and coherently). The slight discrepancy in verb tense is not so significant as to completely obscure the meaning of the sentence, and thus, I would rate this a 95, with close to perfect meaning and grammar.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the choice of verb tense ultimately depends on the intended meaning and desired nuance of the sentence, as well as the broader context in which it is used. For example, if the intention is to convey a stronger sense of inevitability, "would soon cease" might be a more appropriate choice than "was soon to stop". Similarly, if the intention is to emphasize the immediacy of the situation, "was going to stop soon" or "was imminently set to end" might be more fitting.\n\nIn any case, the slight discrepancy in verb tense does not significantly impact the overall meaning or grammatical correctness of the English sentence, and thus the given English version is a perfectly acceptable and readable (albeit slightly different in nuance) approximation of the original.'

Therefore, I would give the English translation a meaning-equivalence score of around 70-75, indicating that the overall meaning of the original is mostly preserved, but with some loss of clarity and fluidity.'

The English translation "enormous agriculture by local owners has allowed good development" conveys the general meaning of the Romanian source. However, the wording in the English version is somewhat awkward and unnatural, likely due to the literal translation of "agricole" as "agriculture" rather than "farms/fields/etc." owned by "local proprieters/owners/etc." This results in a slight loss of fluency, leading to a slight deduction in the overall quality of the translation. Nevertheless, the central message of the sentence is still preserved and understandable.'

The meaning of the original text is mostly preserved in the English translation, with only slight differences in wording and structure. The choice of "shire" instead of "were held" is appropriate for the formal register of the text, but sounds slightly less fluent in English compared to the original. Additionally, the word "of which" is used to refer to the last elections, creating a more formal and slightly less clear structure compared to the direct and clear "the last taking place" in the reference text. Overall, the meaning and grammar of the text are well-preserved, but some slight adjustments could improve the fluency and clarity of the English version.'

While the use of the indefinite article "an/a" might be slightly more fitting in this context, it is still common for translations to use "the" as the English subject in such constructions typically assumes some degree of familiarity.\n\nMoreover, the word "global" slightly obscures the meaning of "la nivel mondial" in the original. The latter is more naturally expressed as "worldwide" or "globally" in English, but the minor difference in phrasing does not significantly alter the meaning.\n\nNevertheless, the overall high degree of accuracy suggests a level of fluency and mastery of the English language, which I would say is above competent and thus deserves a very good, yet not quite perfect, grade.'

While the main subject and verb have been translated relatively accurately, the detail about the pilot being reported missing seems to have been lost, and the word "maturity" in the English version is inappropriate and confusing. A more accurate and appropriate English version would be "Escadrila 65 a pierdut un Hurricane, pilotul fiind dat dispărut," which translates to "Squadron 65 has lost a Hurricane, the pilot being reported missing." The word "escdrilă" in the original text is equivalent to the word "squadron" and "perdut" is equivalent to "lost." The word "pierdut" in the original text is in past tense, hence the use of "has lost" in the English reference. The word "dat" in the original text is equivalent to "given" or "reported" in this context. Therefore, the word "being reported missing" is included in the English reference. The word "mărirea/majoreţe" can refer to "adultness/maturity" in some extended context but its use is not warranted in this case and therefore, I would consider it a mistranslation.

The important information that the city of Timişoara became the temporary capital of the Kingdom of Hungary for eight years during the early 14th century is accurately conveyed in the English version.\n\nNevertheless, the score is not 100 for the following reasons:\n\n1. Specificity: The original sentence specifies that the Kingdom of Hungary is involved, but the English translation only states "Hungary" without explicitly stating that it is a kingdom. This specificity slightly detracts from the meaning of the original sentence.\n\n2. Readability: In the English version, "capital city of the Kingdom of Hungary" is a more complex phrase compared to the original "capitala regatului ungar". The more concise "Hungarian kingdom\'s capital" could have been used for better fluency and comprehension.\n\nOverall, the minor differences mentioned above slightly obstruct the reader\'s full grasp of the meaning in the target language. However, the main meaning remains unchanged. Therefore, I would give the given English translation a 90/100.'

The term "aparait" in the original sentence means "emerge/appear/break out/etc," and the selection of "are appealing" in the English version is a suitable equivalent for expressing the emergence of the right-wing parties.\n\nHowever, the subtle nuances of the two sentences differ slightly, as the choice of "spartakiists" in the original sentence could refer to a specific group of left-leaning individuals or Marxists. Using "spartakists" as a direct reference might not be understood by all English readers, and "left-wing extremism" might be seen as more extreme compared to "spartakists."\n\nThe use of the passive structure "have become" in the reference could also be considered more proper in a strict sense. However, the word "became" in the English version can be seen as equally adequate in the given context.\n\nOverall, the differences between the original and the English version slightly alter the tone and precision of the language. Nevertheless, the English version effectively conveys the primary meaning and intent of the original sentence.'

While the high-level meaning of the sentence is mostly preserved (Austrians and Hungarians are negotiating about the fate of some region, which is to be placed under Hungarian administration according to the plans discussed), there are multiple inaccuracies and awkward phrasings that make the sentence sound unidiomatic and confusing in English.\n\nThe main inaccuracies are related to word usage and grammatical forms. For instance, "Romani" is mistranslated as "Romanian leaves" (a literal translation of "fruntaşii români" that doesn\'t make much sense in English, as "fruntaşi" is not an ordinary noun in this language, let alone a "leaves" noun form). Also, the original phrase "privinţa Banatului" is awkward to read in English as "with regard to the Bank" (a word-by-word translation of the phrase that doesn\'t quite fit the English language context, as "Banat" is not a common English concept to begin with, and the word "with regard to" is rarely paired with the preposition "to" following it in English).\n\nOverall, the grammatical construction of the English sentence isn\'t quite idiomatic either, which further decreases its fluency and meaning clarity. For instance, phrases such as "the talks between Austria and Hungarians" and "to be passed under" do not convey the intended meaning as clearly as the original version. Also, the form "a region being put under some authority\'s administration" is much more commonly used in English text, compared to the form "a region to be passed under some authority\'s control" (which is the original literal word-by-word phrasal equivalent in this case).\n\nIn short, the main idea of the sentence is conveyed in this version (Austrians and Hungarians negotiate the fate of a Romanian region to be placed under Hungarian control), but the specific language construct and the nuances in meaning might be confusing for the reader.'

Additionally, the verb tense in the English sentence is inconsistent, with "led" being in the past tense while "drives" is present tense, and "to the" is a mistranslation of "in" (preposition for "in/at/to a place/city/town/fair"). Therefore, the meaning of the original sentence is not accurately conveyed in the English translation.'

The translation accurately conveys. the meaning of the original Romanian sentence, with the correct grammatical structure and word choices. However, I would deduct a few points for a minor inaccuracy: in the original sentence, the word "a" preceding "continuit" contributes to the aspectual meaning of the verb, indicating that the action of continuing was in progress leading up to a reference point in the past (the end of the war, in this case). In the English translation, "has continued" could potentially imply an action that started and ended in the past, as opposed to continuing up to and beyond the reference point. A more precise English translation might use the present perfect continuous tense, i.e. "The British occupation of Syria has been continuing until the end of the war." However, this is a relatively minor issue, and the provided English translation is still highly accurate and readable. Overall, I would say it is an excellent effort and conveys the meaning of the original text very well.'

The translation is accurate in preserving the meaning of the original Romanian sentence, and the use of "the" before "following sections" adds more clarity in English. However, the article "the" is not strictly necessary in this case, as the original sentence does not include an article before "secțiunile următoare" (which can be translated as "the following sections" or simply "following sections", depending on the context). Therefore, the perfectly literal, somewhat stiffer version of the English sentence (e.g. for a formal or legal text) could be: "Following sections define all specifications". However, I still think that the addition of the article "the" slightly enhances the fluency and readability of the sentence, and I believe that it accurately conveys the meaning and tone of the original sentence. Therefore, I would give the provided English sentence a high rating, as it achieves the primary goal of conveying the original meaning with high accuracy, and it reads naturally in English.'

The difference in meaning slightly changes the overall sentiment of the text, but it is still possible to understand the overall meaning of the text. Therefore, the given English text loses some degree of meaning compared to the original, so the perfect meaning and grammar is not achieved.\n\nMoreover, the grammatical structure of the original sentence slightly differs from the English one, as the adverb "doar" (only) is missing in the English sentence, but this difference is minor and does not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence.

While the English translation is understandable and conveys the main idea of the original sentence, some aspects of the meaning are lost or unclear.\n\nFirst, the word "arpoxximative" in the original sentence is a direct translation of the Romanian word "arpoximativ", which is a term used in statistics to indicate an approximation. In the given sentence, "arpoxximative 95%" is translated as "arpoxymative 95% " which doesn\'t convey the intended meaning and sounds unclear.\n\nSecond, the reference to "Marina US Navy " in the English sentence is confusing as the Marina prefix usually refers to a body of water or a dock, but in this case it seems to refer to the United States Navy. A clear reference to the correct entity (the "U.S. Navy" or "U.S. Naval Forces") is needed to improve the accuracy of the sentence.\n\nOverall, the main meaning of the sentence is preserved, but the grammatical correctness and clarity of the sentence can be improved.

A more precise and literal translation of "priveliște" in this context is "view" or "scenic view/prospect." The word "se deschide" can be translated as "opens up/reveals," but "this reveals" rather than "this opens up" might sound more natural in English. Overall, the reference to a "wonderful haven" is a bit misleading, as "haven" typically refers to a safe place or harbor. Thus, I would slightly modify the English translation to: "A wonderful view opens up to the north and east of the Gheorgheni basin" to more precisely reflect the meaning.'

Firstly, the term "Amirality" in the English translation is incorrect, as the correct form should be "Admiralty" (without the first "i").

Additionally, the word "epurare" in the original is translated as "cleansing" in the reference, but a more precise and commonly used English term for this concept is "purging" or "purge of undesirables/former nobles from the military/army troops."\n\nMoreover, the wording of the reference, "and the purging of ...", implies that the "purge of the nobles from the military/troops" is a separate action from the "execution of those storing the cereal to raise the prize," whereas the original text implies that the purging and the execution of the nobles and the storing of the cereal for this purpose are part of the same, unified idea.\n\nHowever, overall, the English version conveys the meaning of the original text and retains the intended ideas and concepts, so it can be understood with a high degree of confidence.

However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward wordings in the English translation that slightly obscure the meaning.\n\nFor instance, the verb "reia" in the original text is translated as "resubmit" in the English version, which is not an accurate rendering of the meaning. A better choice of verb might be "resume" or "restart" to convey the meaning of continuing an action that had been paused or interrupted.\n\nMoreover, the phrase "area defended by Divisions 18 and 23 on the Somme River" is somewhat awkward and wordy, and could be simplified to "the sector guarded by the 18th and 23rd Divisions along the Somme River" for clarity and fluency.\n\nOverall, the English version captures the essence of the original message, but could be improved with a few minor revisions.

Additionally, the use of "back to" in the beginning of the sentence is confusing and unnecessary, and the word "formers" is missing in "Israeli temple/Israelite temple/the site of the (former) Israeli temple".

The singular "basis" is more appropriate in this context, as there is only one main legal framework governing EU-Russia relations, which is the focus of the text.\n\nTaking this minor discrepancy into account, the English translation can be assigned a high rating of 95 for meaning and grammatical correctness.

While the English version conveys the same overall idea as the original, the grammar and word choice used in the English version make it sound stitled and impersonal, and do not convey the same nuance and connotation as the original.\n\nA more accurate and culturally relevant English version of the original text could be: "This is how the Roma community puts it to use its intelligence/wisdom/stre engineered intelligence/swarm intelligence/art of being resourceful, and so on. "\n\nIn the original, the term "inteligenţa" is a collective noun that can be interpreted as "intelligence/wisdom/stre engineered intelligence/swarm intelligence/art of being resourceful" of a community (in this context, the Roma one). The use of the possessive pronoun "de" in the original, and the word "de" in the beginning of the sentence, further reinforce this meaning.\n\nIn the English version, the possessive pronoun "it\'s" was used, and the word "and" was inserted in the beginning of the sentence. These changes alter the meaning of the sentence, and do not convey the same nuance and connotation as the original.\n\nMoreover, the phrase "by and swarm intelligence " is not commonly used, and the use of "swarm intelligence " in this context is not appropriate, as it usually refers to a decentralized, self-organized system in which a large number of relatively simple agents follow simple rules to achieve a desired outcome.\n\nIn summary, the given English version has about 30% of the meaning and grammar of the original, and a more accurate and culturally relevant English version is: "This is how the Roma people use their intelligence/wisdom/engineered intelligence/art of being resourceful, and so on."'

Preserving the original context of "amurgul șoaptelor târzii" as "late eavesdropping" rather than "The Twilight of the Late Whispers" or "the dusk of the belated whispers" results in a less precise representation of the original title. Additionally, the choice of "a poem of correspondence with the poet" could be more idiomatically expressed as "a correspondence poem with Dumitru Cerna the poet" to improve fluency.'

The small difference in score. (5 points off from a perfect score of 100) is due to the usage of "followed" in the English translation which slightly differs in connotation compared to "a urmat" in the original sentence. While "followed" implies a chronological sequence, "a urmat" here suggests a stronger emphasis on actively pursuing a military career, often making "pursued" the more appropriate option.

'<s>[INST]Score the following translation from Romanian to English with respect to the human reference on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means "no meaning preserved" and score of one hundred means "perfect meaning and grammar". \nRomanian source: Creșterea ritmului înaintării germane a reflectat capacității de luptă a francezilor.\nEnglish human reference: The increase in the pace of the German advance reflected the French battle capacity .\n\nEnglish translation: The increase in the pace of the German submission reflected the French struggle capacity.\nScore: [/INST]'	' by comparing the provided English reference sentence.\n\nThe minor differences in wording between the reference sentence and the given English sentence suggest that the meaning is mostly preserved, but some nuances might be lost or altered. While "submission" might be related to the capacity to resist, it is not exactly equivalent to "lupta/fighting capacity/battle capacity" as in the reference sentence.\n\nThus, a suitable quality estimation for the provided English sentence compared to the reference sentence is approximately 80/100, indicating very good similarity and meaning, but not a perfect equivalence.'
'<s>[INST]Score the following translation from Romanian to English with respect to the human reference on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means "no meaning preserved" and score of one hundred means "perfect meaning and grammar". \nRomanian source: O mare la Kozjak, pe [[Râul Drava_Drava]], află în faza de planificare.\nEnglish human reference: A sea at Kozjak , on the [ [ Drava _ Drava River ] ] , is in the planning phase .\n\nEnglish translation: A large amount of Crete, over [the Drava River _ Drava], is in the planning phase.\nScore: [/INST]'	' I would score the English translation a score of 50 out of 100. While the general idea of planning or existence of something at a location is present in both the source and the English translation, the specific details about the body of water and the location differ. The word "mare" in the source text means "sea" in English, but this is incorrectly translated to a "large amount of Crete" in the English translation. The actual body of water in the source text, the "Râul Drava/Drava River," is incorrectly translated to the "Drava River _ Drava " in the English translation. The word "Crete" is not a valid substitute for the word "marie," meaning "sectors of economic activity." Therefore, the meaning of the English text is unclear and partially incorrect, reducing the meaning preserved compared to the original by about 50%.'
'<s>[INST]Score the following translation from Romanian to English with respect to the human reference on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means "no meaning preserved" and score of one hundred means "perfect meaning and grammar". \nRomanian source: Spaniolii au fost definitiv înfrânți în Bătălia de la Ayacucho din sudul Peruului.\nEnglish human reference: The Spaniards were decisively defeated at the Battle of Ayacucho in southern Peru .\n\nEnglish translation: The Spinach have been definitively defeated in the Ayacucho battle in southern Peruvian.\nScore: [/INST]'	' I would score the provided English translation a score of around 30 out of 100 for meaning and grammar. While the English sentence captures the idea of a battle involving the "Spinach" in southern Peru. The use of "Spinach" to translate "Spanioli" (Romanian for "Spaniards") and the incorrect possessive form "Peruvian" result in a meaning that is significantly different from the original. Additionally, the phrase "Bătălie de la" (Romanian for "battle of the") was not translated into English, resulting in a loss of meaning. However, the overall structure and agency of the sentence are preserved, as well as the idea of a group being defeated. Therefore, I would give a relatively low but passing score for meaning and gramour.'
'<s>[INST]Score the following translation from Romanian to English with respect to the human reference on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where score of zero means "no meaning preserved" and score of one hundred means "perfect meaning and grammar". \nRomanian source: Așa sunt Mitiță Cântărețul, Vică Cizmarul, Mărinaș Croitorul, Ionică Grădinarul,\nEnglish human reference: Such are Mitiță the Singer , Vică the Shoemaker , Marinaș the Tailor , Ionică the Gardener ,\n\nEnglish translation: That is how Cuban Mitide, Vic Cizmarul, Croatian Mark, Garden Ionics,\nScore: [/INST]'	' The score for this translation is 40. While the English translation has captured some elements. such as the list-like structure of the original text, it contains several errors and does not convey the original meaning with great accuracy. For instance, "Cuban" and "Croatian" are not correct translations of "Mitiță Cântărețul" and "Mărinaș Croitorul," respectively. A more accurate English version might be: "Such are Mitiță the Singer, Vică the Cobbler, Marinaș the Tailor, Ionică the Gardener." However, some ambiguity remains due to the unfamiliar names and occupations, as well as the lack of articles in the original text. A more loose English equivalent might be: "We have the Singer Mitiță, the Cobbler Vică, the Tailor Mark, and the Gardener Ionică, for example."'

The meaning and grammar of the Romanian source sentence have been accurately preserved in the English target sentence.\n\nThe English sentence conveys the same meaning as the original sentence, which expresses a limitation of powers to certain specific tasks. The sentence structure in the English sentence is correct and the phrasing of the target language idiomatically reflects the original meaning.\n\nTherefore, I would confidently assign a 100% accuracy score for this English to Romanian sentence pair.'

The proposed English translation "Judge, preservated things and consisting of the keyboard" is far from conveying the same meaning as the original sentence inRomanian, which actually means "Jugdment, by which [He/She] preserves things and in which [the/a] mystery consists "\n\nThe word "keyboard" in the English version is a mistranslation of the word "taiet" which is closer in meaning to "mystery or secret " in this context. The grammatical structure of the sentence is also not well reflected, with the word order being inverted for no clear reason and leading to confusion. Additionally, pronouncing who is doing the preserving in the original sentence is not reflected in the English version.\n'
